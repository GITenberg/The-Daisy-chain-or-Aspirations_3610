    <h2>
      PREFACE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      No one can be more sensible than is the Author that the present is an
      overgrown book of a nondescript class, neither the &ldquo;tale&rdquo; for the young,
      nor the novel for their elders, but a mixture of both.
    </p>
    <p>
      Begun as a series of conversational sketches, the story outran both the
      original intention and the limits of the periodical in which it was
      commenced; and, such as it has become, it is here presented to those who
      have already made acquaintance with the May family, and may be willing to
      see more of them. It would beg to be considered merely as what it calls
      itself, a Family Chronicle&mdash;a domestic record of home events, large
      and small, during those years of early life when the character is chiefly
      formed, and as an endeavour to trace the effects of those aspirations
      which are a part of every youthful nature. That the young should take one
      hint, to think whether their hopes and upward-breathings are truly
      upwards, and founded in lowliness, may be called the moral of the tale.
    </p>
    <p>
      For those who may deem the story too long, and the characters too
      numerous, the Author can only beg their pardon for any tedium that they
      may have undergone before giving it up. Feb. 22nd, 1856.

     Si douce est la Marguerite.&mdash;CHAUCER.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Winter, are you busy? Do you want this afternoon? Can you take a
      good long walk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ethel, my dear, how often have I told you of your impetuosity&mdash;you
      have forgotten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well&rdquo;&mdash;with an impatient twist&mdash;&ldquo;I beg your pardon.
      Good-morning, Miss Winter,&rdquo; said a thin, lank, angular, sallow girl, just
      fifteen, trembling from head to foot with restrained eagerness, as she
      tried to curb her tone into the requisite civility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning, Ethel, good-morning, Flora,&rdquo; said the prim, middle-aged
      daily governess, taking off her bonnet, and arranging the stiff little
      rolls of curl at the long, narrow looking-glass, the border of which
      distorted the countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning,&rdquo; properly responded Flora, a pretty, fair girl, nearly two
      years older than her sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you&mdash;&rdquo; began to burst from Etheldred&rsquo;s lips again, but was
      stifled by Miss Winter&rsquo;s inquiry, &ldquo;Is your mamma pretty well to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! very well,&rdquo; said both at once; &ldquo;she is coming to the reading.&rdquo; And
      Flora added, &ldquo;Papa is going to drive her out to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very glad. And the baby?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do believe she does it on purpose!&rdquo; whispered Ethel to herself,
      wriggling fearfully on the wide window-seat on which she had precipitated
      herself, and kicking at the bar of the table, by which manifestation she
      of course succeeded in deferring her hopes, by a reproof which caused her
      to draw herself into a rigid, melancholy attitude, a sort of penance of
      decorum, but a rapid motion of the eyelids, a tendency to crack the joints
      of the fingers, and an unquietness at the ends of her shoes, betraying the
      restlessness of the digits therein contained.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was such a room as is often to be found in old country town houses, the
      two large windows looking out on a broad old-fashioned street, through
      heavy framework, and panes of glass scratched with various names and
      initials. The walls were painted blue, the skirting almost a third of the
      height, and so wide at the top as to form a narrow shelf. The fireplace,
      constructed in the days when fires were made to give as little heat as
      possible, was ornamented with blue and white Dutch tiles bearing
      marvellous representations of Scripture history, and was protected by a
      very tall green guard; the chairs were much of the same date, solid and
      heavy, the seats in faded carpet-work, but there was a sprinkling of
      lesser ones and of stools; a piano; a globe; a large table in the middle
      of the room, with three desks on it; a small one, and a light cane chair
      by each window; and loaded book-cases. Flora began, &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t want
      this afternoon to yourself&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel was on her feet, and open-mouthed. &ldquo;Oh, Miss Winter, if you would be
      so kind as to walk to Cocksmoor with us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Cocksmoor, my dear!&rdquo; exclaimed the governess in dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, but hear,&rdquo; cried Ethel. &ldquo;It is not for nothing. Yesterday&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, the day before,&rdquo; interposed Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was a poor man brought into the hospital. He had been terribly hurt
      in the quarry, and papa says he&rsquo;ll die. He was in great distress, for his
      wife has just got twins, and there were lots of children before. They want
      everything&mdash;food and clothes&mdash;and we want to walk and take it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We had a collection of clothes ready, luckily,&rdquo; said Flora; &ldquo;and we have
      a blanket, and some tea and some arrowroot, and a bit of bacon, and mamma
      says she does not think it too far for us to walk, if you will be so kind
      as to go with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Winter looked perplexed. &ldquo;How could you carry the blanket, my dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we have settled that,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;we mean to make the donkey a
      sumpter-mule, so, if you are tired, you may ride home on her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear, has your mamma considered? They are such a set of wild
      people at Cocksmoor; I don&rsquo;t think we could walk there alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is Saturday,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;we can get the boys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you would reflect a little! They would be no protection. Harry would
      be getting into scrapes, and you and Mary running wild.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish Richard was at home!&rdquo; said Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know!&rdquo; cried Ethel. &ldquo;Mr. Ernescliffe will come. I am sure he can walk
      so far now. I&rsquo;ll ask him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel had clapped after her the heavy door with its shining brass lock,
      before Miss Winter well knew what she was about, and the governess seemed
      annoyed. &ldquo;Ethel does not consider,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think your mamma
      will be pleased.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; said Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear&mdash;a gentleman walking with you, especially if Margaret is
      going!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he is strong enough,&rdquo; said Flora; &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t think why
      there should be any harm. Papa took us all out walking with him yesterday&mdash;little
      Aubrey and all, and Mr. Ernescliffe went.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was interrupted by the entrance of a fine tall blooming girl of
      eighteen, holding in her hand a pretty little maid of five. &ldquo;Good-morning.
      Miss Winter. I suppose Flora has told you the request we have to make to
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my dear Margaret, but did your mamma consider what a lawless place
      Cocksmoor is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was the doubt,&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;but papa said he would answer for it
      nothing would happen to us, and mamma said if you would be so kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is unlucky,&rdquo; began the governess, but stopped at the incursion of some
      new-comers, nearly tumbling over each other, Ethel at the head of them.
      &ldquo;Oh, Harry!&rdquo; as the gathers of her frock gave way in the rude grasp of a
      twelve-year-old boy. &ldquo;Miss Winter, &lsquo;tis all right&mdash;Mr. Ernescliffe
      says he is quite up to the walk, and will like it very much, and he will
      undertake to defend you from the quarrymen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Miss Winter afraid of the quarrymen?&rdquo; hallooed Harry. &ldquo;Shall I take a
      club?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take my gun and shoot them,&rdquo; valiantly exclaimed Tom; and while
      threats were passing among the boys, Margaret asked, in a low voice, &ldquo;Did
      you ask him to come with us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he said he should like it of all things. Papa was there, and said it
      was not too far for him&mdash;besides, there&rsquo;s the donkey. Papa says it,
      so we must go, Miss Winter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Winter glanced unutterable things at Margaret, and Ethel began to
      perceive she had done something wrong. Flora was going to speak, when
      Margaret, trying to appear unconscious of a certain deepening colour in
      her own cheeks, pressed a hand on her shoulder, and whispering, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see
      about it. Don&rsquo;t say any more, please,&rdquo; glided out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s in the wind?&rdquo; said Harry. &ldquo;Are many of your reefs out there,
      Ethel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harry can talk nothing but sailors&rsquo; language,&rdquo; said Flora, &ldquo;and I am sure
      he did not learn that of Mr. Ernescliffe. You never hear slang from him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But aren&rsquo;t we going to Cocksmoor?&rdquo; asked Mary, a blunt downright girl of
      ten.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall know soon,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;I suppose I had better wait till after
      the reading to mend that horrid frock?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so, since we are so nearly collected,&rdquo; said Miss Winter; and
      Ethel, seating herself on the corner of the window-seat, with one leg
      doubled under her, took up a Shakespeare, holding it close to her eyes,
      and her brother Norman, who, in age, came between her and Flora, kneeling
      on one knee on the window-seat, and supporting himself with one arm
      against the shutter, leaned over her, reading it too, disregarding a
      tumultuous skirmish going on in that division of the family collectively
      termed &ldquo;the boys,&rdquo; namely, Harry, Mary, and Tom, until Tom was suddenly
      pushed down, and tumbled over into Ethel&rsquo;s lap, thereby upsetting her and
      Norman together, and there was a general downfall, and a loud scream, &ldquo;The
      sphynx!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve crushed it,&rdquo; cried Harry, dealing out thumps indiscriminately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, here &lsquo;tis,&rdquo; said Mary, rushing among them, and bringing out a green
      sphynx caterpillar on her finger&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;tis not hurt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pax! Pax!&rdquo; cried Norman, over all, with the voice of an authority, as he
      leaped up lightly and set Tom on his legs again. &ldquo;Harry! you had better do
      that again,&rdquo; he added warningly. &ldquo;Be off, out of this window, and let
      Ethel and me read in peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the place,&rdquo; said Ethel&mdash;&ldquo;Crispin, Crispian&rsquo;s day. How I do
      like Henry V.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is no use to try to keep those boys in order!&rdquo; sighed Miss Winter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saturnalia, as papa calls Saturday,&rdquo; replied Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is not your eldest brother coming home to-day?&rdquo; said Miss Winter in a low
      voice to Flora, who shook her head, and said confidentially, &ldquo;He is not
      coming till he has passed that examination. He thinks it better not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here entered, with a baby in her arms, a lady with a beautiful countenance
      of calm sweetness, looking almost too young to be the mother of the tall
      Margaret, who followed her. There was a general hush as she greeted Miss
      Winter, the girls crowding round to look at their little sister, not quite
      six weeks old.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Margaret, will you take her up to the nursery?&rdquo; said the mother,
      while the impatient speech was repeated, &ldquo;Mamma, can we go to Cocksmoor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think it will be too far for you?&rdquo; said the mother to Miss
      Winter as Margaret departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, not at all, thank you, that was not&mdash;But Margaret has
      explained.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, poor Margaret,&rdquo; said Mrs. May, smiling. &ldquo;She has settled it by
      choosing to stay at home with me. It is no matter for the others, and he
      is going on Monday, so that it will not happen again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Margaret has behaved very well,&rdquo; said Miss Winter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has indeed,&rdquo; said her mother, smiling. &ldquo;Well, Harry, how is the
      caterpillar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve just capsized it, mamma,&rdquo; answered Harry, &ldquo;and Mary is making all
      taut.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. May laughed, and proceeded to advise Ethel and Norman to put away
      Henry V., and find the places in their Bibles, &ldquo;or you will have the
      things mixed together in your heads,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime Margaret, with the little babe, to-morrow to be her
      godchild, lying gently in her arms, came out into the matted hall, and
      began to mount the broad shallow-stepped staircase, protected by low stout
      balusters, with a very thick, flat, and solid mahogany hand-rail, polished
      by the boys&rsquo; constant riding up and down upon it. She was only on the
      first step, when the dining-room door opened, and there came out a young
      man, slight, and delicate-looking, with bright blue eyes, and
      thickly-curling light hair. &ldquo;Acting nurse?&rdquo; he said, smiling. &ldquo;What an odd
      little face it is! I didn&rsquo;t think little white babies were so pretty!
      Well, I shall always consider myself as the real godfather&mdash;the other
      is all a sham.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; said Margaret; &ldquo;but I must not stand with her in a draught,&rdquo;
       and on she went, while he called after her. &ldquo;So we are to have an
      expedition to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not gainsay it, but there was a little sigh of disappointment, and
      when she was out of hearing, she whispered, &ldquo;Oh! lucky baby, to have so
      many years to come before you are plagued with troublesome propriety!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then depositing her little charge with the nurse, and trying to cheer up a
      solemn-looking boy of three, who evidently considered his deposition from
      babyhood as a great injury, she tripped lightly down again, to take part
      in the Saturday&rsquo;s reading and catechising.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was pleasant to see that large family in the hush and reverence of such
      teaching, the mother&rsquo;s gentle power preventing the outbreaks of
      restlessness to which even at such times the wild young spirits were
      liable. Margaret and Miss Winter especially rejoiced in it on this
      occasion, the first since the birth of the baby, that she had been able to
      preside. Under her, though seemingly without her taking any trouble, there
      was none of the smothered laughing at the little mistakes, the fidgeting
      of the boys, or Harry&rsquo;s audacious impertinence to Miss Winter; and no less
      glad was Harry to have his mother there, and be guarded from himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Catechism was repeated, and a comment on the Sunday Services read
      aloud. The Gospel was that on the taking the lowest place, and when they
      had finished, Ethel said, &ldquo;I like the verse which explains that:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       &lsquo;They who now sit lowest here,
        When their Master shall appear,
        He shall bid them higher rise,
        And be highest in the skies.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not think of that being the meaning of &lsquo;when He that bade thee
      cometh,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Norman thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seemed to be only our worldly advantage that was meant before,&rdquo; said
      Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it means that too,&rdquo; said Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it does,&rdquo; said Mrs. May; &ldquo;but the higher sense is the one
      chiefly to be dwelt on. It is a lesson how those least known and regarded
      here, and humblest in their own eyes, shall be the highest hereafter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Margaret looked earnestly at her mother, but did not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May we go, mamma?&rdquo; said Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you three&mdash;all of you, indeed, unless you wish to say any
      more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;boys&rdquo; availed themselves of the permission. Norman tarried to put his
      books into a neat leather case, and Ethel stood thinking. &ldquo;It means
      altogether&mdash;it is a lesson against ambition,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; said her mother, &ldquo;the love of eminence for its own sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And in so many different ways!&rdquo; said Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, worldly greatness, riches, rank, beauty,&rdquo; said Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All sorts of false flash and nonsense, and liking to be higher than one
      ought to be,&rdquo; said Norman. &ldquo;I am sure there is nothing lower, or more mean
      and shabby, than getting places and praise a fellow does not deserve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; cried Ethel, &ldquo;but no one fit to speak to would do that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plenty of people do, I can tell you,&rdquo; said Norman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I hope I shall never know who they are!&rdquo; exclaimed Ethel. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll
      tell you what I was thinking of, mamma. Caring to be clever, and get on,
      only for the sake of beating people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that might be better expressed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Ethel, bending her brow, with the fullness of her thought&mdash;&ldquo;I
      mean caring to do a thing only because nobody else can do it&mdash;wanting
      to be first more than wanting to do one&rsquo;s best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quite right, my dear Ethel,&rdquo; said her mother; &ldquo;and I am glad you
      have found in the Gospel a practical lesson, that should be useful to you
      both. I had rather you did so than that you read it in Greek, though that
      is very nice too,&rdquo; she added, smiling, as she put her hand on a little
      Greek Testament, in which Ethel had been reading it, within her English
      Bible. &ldquo;Now, go and mend that deplorable frock, and if you don&rsquo;t dream
      over it, you won&rsquo;t waste too much of your holiday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get it done in no time!&rdquo; cried Ethel, rushing headlong upstairs,
      twice tripping in it before she reached the attic, where she slept, as
      well as Flora and Mary&mdash;a large room in the roof, the windows gay
      with bird-cages and flowers, a canary singing loud enough to deafen any
      one but girls to whom headaches were unknown, plenty of books and
      treasures, and a very fine view, from the dormer window, of the town
      sloping downwards, and the river winding away, with some heathy hills in
      the distance. Poking and peering about with her short-sighted eyes, Ethel
      lighted on a work-basket in rare disorder, pulled off her frock, threw on
      a shawl, and sat down cross-legged on her bed, stitching vigorously, while
      meantime she spouted with great emphasis an ode of Horace, which Norman
      having learned by heart, she had followed his example; it being her great
      desire to be even with him in all his studies, and though eleven months
      younger, she had never yet fallen behind him. On Saturday, he showed her
      what were his tasks for the week, and as soon as her rent was repaired,
      she swung herself downstairs in search of him for this purpose. She found
      him in the drawing-room, a pretty, pleasant room&mdash;its only fault that
      it was rather too low. It had windows opening down to the lawn, and was
      full of pretty things, works and knick-knacks. Ethel found the state of
      affairs unfavourable to her. Norman was intent on a book on the sofa, and
      at the table sat Mr. Ernescliffe, hard at work with calculations and
      mathematical instruments. Ethel would not for the world that any one
      should guess at her classical studies&mdash;she scarcely liked to believe
      that even her father knew of them, and to mention them before Mr.
      Ernescliffe would have been dreadful. So she only shoved Norman, and asked
      him to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Presently,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you here?&rdquo; said she, poking her head into the book. &ldquo;Oh! no
      wonder you can&rsquo;t leave off. I&rsquo;ve been wanting you to read it all the
      week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She read over him a few minutes, then recoiled: &ldquo;I forgot, mamma told me
      not to read those stories in the morning. Only five minutes, Norman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a bit, I&rsquo;ll come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She fidgeted, till Mr. Ernescliffe asked Norman if there was a table of
      logarithms in the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; she answered; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you know, Norman? In a brown book on the
      upper shelf in the dining-room. Don&rsquo;t you remember papa&rsquo;s telling us the
      meaning of them, when we had the grand book-dusting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was conscious of nothing but his book; however, she found the
      logarithms, and brought them to Mr. Ernescliffe, staying to look at his
      drawing, and asking what he was making out. He replied, smiling at the
      impossibility of her understanding, but she wrinkled her brown forehead,
      hooked her long nose, and spent the next hour in amateur navigation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Market Stoneborough was a fine old town. The Minster, grand with the
      architecture of the time of Henry III., stood beside a broad river, and
      round it were the buildings of a convent, made by a certain good Bishop
      Whichcote, the nucleus of a grammar school, which had survived the
      Reformation, and trained up many good scholars; among them, one of
      England&rsquo;s princely merchants, Nicholas Randall, whose effigy knelt in a
      niche in the chancel wall, scarlet-cloaked, white-ruffed, and black
      doubletted, a desk bearing an open Bible before him, and a twisted pillar
      of Derbyshire spar on each side. He was the founder of thirteen
      almshouses, and had endowed two scholarships at Oxford, the object of
      ambition of the Stoneborough boys, every eighteen months.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were about sixty or seventy boarders, and the town boys slept at
      home, and spent their weekly holiday there on Saturday&mdash;the happiest
      day in the week to the May family, when alone, they had the company at
      dinner of Norman and Harry, otherwise known by their school names of June
      and July, given them because their elder brother had begun the series of
      months as May.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some two hundred years back, a Dr. Thomas May had been headmaster, but
      ever since that time there had always been an M. D., not a D. D., in the
      family, owning a comfortable demesne of spacious garden, and field enough
      for two cows, still green and intact, among modern buildings and
      improvements.
    </p>
    <p>
      The present Dr. May stood very high in his profession, and might soon have
      made a large fortune in London, had he not held fast to his home
      attachments. He was extremely skilful and clever, with a boyish character
      that seemed as if it could never grow older; ardent, sensitive, and
      heedless, with a quickness of sympathy and tenderness of heart that was
      increased, rather than blunted, by exercise in scenes of suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of the previous summer holidays, Dr. May had been called one
      morning to attend a gentleman who had been taken very ill, at the Swan
      Inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was received by a little boy of ten years old, in much grief,
      explaining that his brother had come two days ago from London, to bring
      him to school here; he had seemed unwell ever since they met, and last
      night had become much worse. And extremely ill the doctor found him; a
      youth of two or three and twenty, suffering under a severe attack of
      fever, oppressed, and scarcely conscious, so as quite to justify his
      little brother&rsquo;s apprehensions. He advised the boy to write to his family,
      but was answered by a look that went to his heart&mdash;&ldquo;Alan&rdquo; was all he
      had in the world&mdash;father and mother were dead, and their relations
      lived in Scotland, and were hardly known to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where have you been living, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alan sent me to school at Miss Lawler&rsquo;s when my mother died, and there I
      have been ever since, while he has been these three years and a half on
      the African station.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, is he in the navy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the boy proudly, &ldquo;Lieutenant Ernescliffe. He got his promotion
      last week. My father was in the battle of Trafalgar; and Alan has been
      three years in the West Indies, and then he was in the Mediterranean, and
      now on the coast of Africa, in the Atalantis. You must have heard about
      him, for it was in the newspaper, how, when he was mate, he had the
      command of the Santa Isabel, the slaver they captured.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy would have gone on for ever, if Dr. May had not recalled him to
      his brother&rsquo;s present condition, and proceeded to take every measure for
      the welfare and comfort of the forlorn pair. He learned from other sources
      that the Ernescliffes were well connected. The father had been a
      distinguished officer, but had been ill able to provide for his sons;
      indeed, he died, without ever having seen little Hector, who was born
      during his absence on a voyage&mdash;his last, and Alan&rsquo;s first. Alan, the
      elder by thirteen years, had been like a father to the little boy, showing
      judgment and self-denial that marked him of a high cast of character. He
      had distinguished himself in encounters with slave ships, and in command
      of a prize that he had had to conduct to Sierra Leone, he had shown great
      coolness and seamanship, in several perilous conjunctures, such as a
      sudden storm, and an encounter with another slaver, when his Portuguese
      prisoners became mutinous, and nothing but his steadiness and intrepidity
      had saved the lives of himself and his few English companions. He was, in
      fact, as Dr. May reported, pretty much of a hero. He had not, at the time,
      felt the effects of the climate, but, owing to sickness and death among
      the other officers, he had suffered much fatigue and pressure of mind and
      body. Immediately on his return, had followed his examination, and though
      he had passed with great credit, and it had been at once followed by
      well-earned promotion, his nervous excitable frame had been overtasked,
      and the consequence was a long and severe illness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Swan Inn was not forty yards from Dr. May&rsquo;s back gate, and, at every
      spare moment, he was doing the part of nurse as well as doctor,
      professionally obliged to Alan Ernescliffe for bringing him a curious
      exotic specimen of fever, and requiting him by the utmost care and
      attention, while, for their own sakes, he delighted in the two boys with
      all the enthusiasm of his warm heart. Before the first week was at an end,
      they had learned to look on the doctor as one of the kindest friends it
      had been their lot to meet with, and Alan knew that if he died, he should
      leave his little brother in the hands of one who would comfort him as a
      father.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner was young Ernescliffe able to sit up, than Dr. May insisted on
      conveying him to his own house, as his recovery was likely to be tedious
      in solitude at the Swan. It was not till he had been drawn in a chair
      along the sloping garden, and placed on the sofa to rest, that he
      discovered that the time the good doctor had chosen for bringing a
      helpless convalescent to his house, was two days after an eleventh child
      had been added to his family.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. May was too sorry for the solitary youth, and too sympathising with
      her husband, to make any objection, though she was not fond of strangers,
      and had some anxieties. She had the utmost dependence on Margaret&rsquo;s
      discretion, but there was a chance of awkward situations, which papa was
      not likely to see or guard against. However, all seemed to do very well,
      and no one ever came into her room without some degree of rapture about
      Mr. Ernescliffe. The doctor reiterated praises of his excellence, his
      principle, his ability and talent, his amusing talk; the girls were always
      bringing reports of his perfections; Norman retracted his grumbling at
      having his evenings spoiled; and &ldquo;the boys&rdquo; were bursting with the secret
      that he was teaching them to rig a little ship that was to astonish mamma
      on her first coming downstairs, and to be named after the baby; while
      Blanche did all the coquetry with him, from which Margaret abstained. The
      universal desire was for mamma to see him, and when the time came, she
      owned that papa&rsquo;s swan had not turned out a goose.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were now no grounds for prolonging his stay; but it was very hard to
      go, and he was glad to avail himself of the excuse of remaining for the
      christening, when he was to represent the absent godfather. After that, he
      must go; he had written to his Scottish cousins to offer a visit, and he
      had a promise that he should soon be afloat again. No place would ever
      seem to him so like home as Market Stoneborough. He was quite like one of
      themselves, and took a full share in the discussions on the baby&rsquo;s name,
      which, as all the old family appellations had been used up, was an open
      question. The doctor protested against Alice and Edith, which he said were
      the universal names in the present day. The boys hissed every attempt of
      their sisters at a romantic name, and then Harry wanted it to be
      Atalantis! At last Dr. May announced that he should have her named
      Dowsabel if they did not agree, and Mrs. May advised all the parties
      concerned to write their choice on a slip of paper, and little Aubrey
      should draw two out of her bag, trusting that Atalantis Dowsabel would not
      come out, as Harry confidently predicted.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, it was even worse, Aubrey&rsquo;s two lots were Gertrude and Margaret.
      Ethel and Mary made a vehement uproar to discover who could have written
      Margaret, and at last traced it home to Mr. Ernescliffe, who replied that
      Flora, without saying why, had desired him to set down his favourite name.
      He was much disconcerted, and did not materially mend the matter by saying
      it was the first name that came into his head.

      CHAPTER II.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Meadows trim with daisies pied.&mdash;MILTON.
</pre>
    <p>
      Ethel&rsquo;s navigation lesson was interrupted by the dinner-bell. That long
      table was a goodly sight. Few ever looked happier than Dr. and Mrs. May,
      as they sat opposite to each other, presenting a considerable contrast in
      appearance as in disposition. She was a little woman, with that smooth
      pleasant plumpness that seems to belong to perfect content and serenity,
      her complexion fair and youthful, her face and figure very pretty, and
      full of quiet grace and refinement, and her whole air and expression
      denoting a serene, unruffled, affectionate happiness, yet with much
      authority in her mildness&mdash;warm and open in her own family, but
      reserved beyond it, and shrinking from general society.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor, on the contrary, had a lank, bony figure, nearly six feet
      high, and looking more so from his slightness; a face sallow, thin, and
      strongly marked, an aquiline nose, highly developed forehead, and peculiar
      temples, over which the hair strayed in thin curling flakes. His eyes were
      light coloured, and were seldom seen without his near-sighted spectacles,
      but the expressions of the mouth were everything&mdash;so varying, so
      bright, and so sweet were his smiles that showed beautiful white teeth&mdash;moreover,
      his hand was particularly well made, small and delicate; and it always
      turned out that no one ever recollected that Dr. May was plain, who had
      heard his kindly greeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sons and daughters were divided in likeness to father and mother;
      Ethel was almost an exaggeration of the doctor&rsquo;s peculiarities, especially
      at the formed, but unsoftened age of fifteen; Norman had his long nose,
      sallow complexion, and tall figure, but was much improved by his mother&rsquo;s
      fine blue eyes, and was a very pleasant-looking boy, though not handsome;
      little Tom was a thin, white, delicate edition of his father; and Blanche
      contrived to combine great likeness to him with a great deal of
      prettiness. Of those that, as nurse said, favoured their mamma, Margaret
      was tall and blooming, with the same calm eyes, but with the brilliance of
      her father&rsquo;s smile; Flora had greater regularity of feature, and was fast
      becoming a very pretty girl, while Mary and Harry could not boast of much
      beauty, but were stout sturdy pictures of health; Harry&rsquo;s locks in masses
      of small tight yellow curls, much given to tangling and matting, unfit to
      be seen all the week, till nurse put him to torture every Saturday, by
      combing them out so as, at least, to make him for once like, she said, a
      gentleman, instead of a young lion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Aubrey was said by his papa to be like nothing but the full moon.
      And there he shone on them, by his mamma&rsquo;s side, announcing in language
      few could understand, where he had been with papa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has been a small doctor,&rdquo; said his father, beginning to cut the boiled
      beef as fast as if his hands had been moved by machinery. &ldquo;He has been
      with me to see old Mrs. Robins, and she made so much of him, that if I
      take him again he&rsquo;ll be regularly spoiled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor old woman, it must have been a pleasure to her,&rdquo; said Mrs. May&mdash;&ldquo;it
      is so seldom she has any change.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is she?&rdquo; asked Mr. Ernescliffe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The butcher&rsquo;s old mother,&rdquo; said Margaret, who was next to him. &ldquo;She is
      one of papa&rsquo;s pet patients, because he thinks her desolate and ill-used.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her sons bully her,&rdquo; said the doctor, too intent on carving to perceive
      certain deprecatory glances of caution cast at him by his wife, to remind
      him of the presence of man and maid&mdash;&ldquo;and that smart daughter is
      worse still. She never comes to see the old lady but she throws her into
      an agitated state, fit to bring on another attack. A meek old soul, not
      fit to contend with them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do they do it?&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the cause of all evil! That daughter marries a grazier, and wants to
      set up for gentility; she comes and squeezes presents out of her mother,
      and the whole family are distrusting each other, and squabbling over the
      spoil before the poor old creature is dead! It makes one sick! I gave that
      Mrs. Thorn a bit of my mind at last; I could not stand the sight any
      longer. Madam, said I, you&rsquo;ll have to answer for your mother&rsquo;s death, as
      sure as my name&rsquo;s Dick May&mdash;a harpy dressed up in feathers and lace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a great laugh, and an entreaty to know whether this was really
      his address&mdash;Ethel telling him she knew he had muttered it to himself
      quite audibly, for which she was rewarded by a pretended box on the ear.
      It certainly was vain to expect order at dinner on Saturday, for the
      doctor was as bad as the boys, and Mrs. May took it with complete
      composure, hardly appearing sensible of the Babel which would sometimes
      almost deafen its promoter, papa; and yet her interference was
      all-powerful, as now when Harry and Mary were sparring over the salt, with
      one gentle &ldquo;Mary!&rdquo; and one reproving glance, they were reduced to
      quiescence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Dr. May, in a voice above the tumult, was telling &ldquo;Maggie,&rdquo; as
      he always called his wife, some piece of news about Mr. Rivers, who had
      bought Abbotstoke Grange; and Alan Ernescliffe, in much lower tones,
      saying to Margaret how he delighted in the sight of these home scenes, and
      this free household mirth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the first time you have seen us in perfection,&rdquo; said Margaret,
      &ldquo;with mamma at the head of the table&mdash;no, not quite perfection
      either, without Richard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very glad to have seen it,&rdquo; repeated Alan. &ldquo;What a blessing it must
      be to your brothers to have such a home!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; said Margaret earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot fancy any advantage in life equal to it. Your father and mother
      so entirely one with you all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret smiled, too much pleased to speak, and glanced at her mother&rsquo;s
      sweet face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t think how often I shall remember it, or how rejoiced I&mdash;&rdquo;
       He broke off, for the noise subsided, and his speech was not intended for
      the public ear, so he dashed into the general conversation, and catching
      his own name, exclaimed, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that base proposal, Ethel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To put you on the donkey,&rdquo; said Norman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They want to see a sailor riding,&rdquo; interposed the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. May!&rdquo; cried the indignant voice of Hector Ernescliffe, as his honest
      Scottish face flushed like a turkey cock, &ldquo;I assure you that Alan rides
      like&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like a horse marine,&rdquo; said Norman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hector and Harry both looked furious, but &ldquo;June&rdquo; was too great a man in
      their world for them to attempt any revenge, and it was left for Mary to
      call out, &ldquo;Why, Norman, nonsense! Mr. Ernescliffe rode the new black
      kicking horse till he made it quite steady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Made it steady! No, Mary, that is saying too much for it,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Ernescliffe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has no harm in it&mdash;capital horse&mdash;splendid,&rdquo; said the
      doctor; &ldquo;I shall take you out with it this afternoon, Maggie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have driven it several times?&rdquo; said Alan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I drove him to Abbotstoke yesterday&mdash;never started, except at a
      fool of a woman with an umbrella, and at the train&mdash;and we&rsquo;ll take
      care not to meet that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is only to avoid the viaduct at half-past four,&rdquo; said Mrs. May, &ldquo;and
      that is easily done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you are bound for Cocksmoor?&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;I told the poor fellow
      you were going to see his wife, and he was so thankful, that it did one&rsquo;s
      heart good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he better? I should like to tell his wife,&rdquo; said Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor screwed up his face. &ldquo;A bad business,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;he is a shade
      better to-day; he may get through yet; but he is not my patient. I only
      saw him because I happened to be there when he was brought in, and Ward
      was not in the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what&rsquo;s his name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell&mdash;don&rsquo;t think I ever heard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We ought to know,&rdquo; said Miss Winter; &ldquo;it would be awkward to go without.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To go roaming about Cocksmoor asking where the man in the hospital
      lives!&rdquo; said Flora. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t wait till Monday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done,&rdquo; said Norman; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll run down to the hospital and find out. May
      I, mamma?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without your pudding, old fellow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want pudding,&rdquo; said Norman, slipping back his chair. &ldquo;May I,
      mamma?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure you may;&rdquo; and Norman, with a hand on the back of Ethel&rsquo;s
      chair, took a flying leap over his own, that set all the glasses ringing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, stop! know what you are going after, sir,&rdquo; cried his father. &ldquo;What
      will they know there of Cocksmoor, or the man whose wife has twins? You
      must ask for the accident in number five.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And oh, Norman, come back in time!&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be bound I&rsquo;m back before Etheldred the Unready wants me,&rdquo; he
      answered, bounding off with an elasticity that caused his mother to say
      the boy was made of india-rubber; and then putting his head in by the
      window to say, &ldquo;By-the-bye, if there&rsquo;s any pudding owing to me, that
      little chorister fellow of ours, Bill Blake, has got a lot of voracious
      brothers that want anything that&rsquo;s going. Tom and Blanche might take it
      down to &lsquo;em; I&rsquo;m off! Hooray!&rdquo; and he scampered headlong up the garden,
      prolonging his voice into a tremendous shout as he got farther off,
      leaving every one laughing, and his mother tenderly observing that he was
      going to run a quarter of a mile and back, and lose his only chance of
      pudding for the week&mdash;old Bishop Whichcote&rsquo;s rules contemplating no
      fare but daily mutton, to be bought at a shilling per sheep. A little
      private discussion ensued between Harry and Hector on the merits of the
      cakes at Ballhatchet&rsquo;s gate, and old Nelly&rsquo;s pies, which led the doctor to
      mourn over the loss of the tarts of the cranberries, that used to grow on
      Cocksmoor, before it was inhabited, and to be the delight of the scholars
      of Stoneborough, when he was one of them&mdash;and then to enchant the
      boys by relations of ancient exploits, especially his friend Spencer
      climbing up, and engraving a name on the top of the market cross, now no
      more&mdash;swept away by the Town Council in a fit of improvement, which
      had for the last twenty years enraged the doctor at every remembrance of
      it. Perhaps at this moment his wife could hardly sympathise, when she
      thought of her boys emulating such deeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;will you lend me a pair of spectacles for the walk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And make yourself one, Ethel,&rdquo; said Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care&mdash;I want to see the view.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very bad for you, Ethel,&rdquo; further added her mother; &ldquo;you will make
      your sight much shorter if you accustom your eyes to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, mamma, I never do wear them about the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a very good reason,&rdquo; said Margaret; &ldquo;because you haven&rsquo;t got them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I believe Harry stole them in the holidays.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stole them!&rdquo; said the doctor; &ldquo;as if they weren&rsquo;t my property,
      unjustifiably appropriated by her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were that pair that you never could keep on, papa,&rdquo; said Ethel&mdash;&ldquo;no
      use at all to you. Come, do lend me them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I shan&rsquo;t let you wear them,&rdquo; said Harry. &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t go, if you
      choose to make yourself such an object.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the father, &ldquo;the boys thought it time to put a stop to it when
      it came to a caricature of the little doctor in petticoats.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, in Norman&rsquo;s Lexicon,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;a capital likeness of you, papa;
      but I never could get him to tell me who drew it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nor did Ethel know that that caricature had been the cause of the black
      eye that Harry had brought home last summer. Harry returned, to protest
      that he would not join the walk, if she chose to be seen in the
      spectacles, while she undauntedly continued her petition, though answered
      that she would attract the attacks of the quarrymen, who would take her
      for an attenuated owl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you were obliged to go about without them yourself, papa!&rdquo; cried
      Ethel, &ldquo;and then you would know how tiresome it is not to see twice the
      length of your own nose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not such a very short allowance either,&rdquo; said the doctor quaintly, and
      therewith the dinner concluded. There was apt to be a race between the two
      eldest girls for the honour of bringing down the baby; but this time their
      father strode up three steps at once, turned at the top of the first
      flight, made his bow to them, and presently came down with his little
      daughter in his arms, nodded triumphantly at the sisters, and set her down
      on her mother&rsquo;s lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, Maggie, you are complete, you old hen-and-chicken daisy. Can&rsquo;t you
      take her portrait in the character, Margaret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With her pink cap, and Blanche and Aubrey as they are now, on each side?&rdquo;
       said Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Margaret ought to be in the picture herself,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;Fetch the
      artist in Norman&rsquo;s Lexicon, Harry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since he has hit off one of us so well,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;Well! I&rsquo;m off.
      I must see old Southern. You&rsquo;ll be ready by three? Good-bye, hen and
      chicken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I may have the spectacles?&rdquo; said Ethel, running after him; &ldquo;you know
      I am an injured individual, for mamma won&rsquo;t let me carry baby about the
      house because I am so blind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are welcome to embellish yourself, as far as I am concerned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A general dispersion ensued, and only Mrs. May, Margaret, and the baby,
      remained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; sighed Margaret; &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t be the hen-and-chicken daisy
      properly, without all your chickens. It is the first christening we ever
      had without our all being there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was best not to press it, my dear,&rdquo; said her mother. &ldquo;Your papa would
      have had his thoughts turned to the disappointment again and it makes
      Richard himself so unhappy to see his vexation, that I believe it is
      better not to renew it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But to miss him for so long!&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;Perhaps it is best, for it
      is very miserable when papa is sarcastic and sharp, and he cannot
      understand it, and takes it as meaning so much more than it really does,
      and grows all the more frightened and diffident. I cannot think what he
      would do without you to encourage him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or you, you good sister,&rdquo; said her mother, smiling. &ldquo;If we could only
      teach him not to mind being laughed at, and to have some confidence in
      himself, he and papa would get on together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very hard,&rdquo; cried Margaret, almost indignantly, &ldquo;that papa won&rsquo;t
      believe it, when he does his best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think papa can bear to bring himself to believe that it is his
      best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is too clever himself to see how other people can be slow,&rdquo; said
      Margaret; &ldquo;and yet&rdquo;&mdash;the tears came into her eyes&mdash;&ldquo;I cannot
      bear to think of his telling Richard it was no use to think of being a
      clergyman, and he had better turn carpenter at once, just because he
      failed in his examination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, I wish you would forget that,&rdquo; said Mrs. May. &ldquo;You know papa
      sometimes says more than he means, and he was excessively vexed and
      disappointed. I know he was pleased with Ritchie&rsquo;s resolve not to come
      home again till he had passed, and it is best that it should not be
      broken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The whole vacation, studying so hard, and this christening!&rdquo; said
      Margaret; &ldquo;it is treating him as if he had done wrong. I do believe Mr.
      Ernescliffe thinks he has&mdash;for papa always turns away the
      conversation if his name is mentioned! I wish you would explain it, mamma;
      I can&rsquo;t bear that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I can,&rdquo; said Mrs. May, rather pleased that Margaret had taken on
      herself this vindication of her favourite brother her father&rsquo;s expense.
      &ldquo;But, after all, Margaret, I never feel quite sure that poor Ritchie does
      exert himself to the utmost, he is too desponding to make the most of
      himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the more vexed papa is, the worse it grows!&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;It is
      provoking, though. How I do wish sometimes to give Ritchie a jog, when
      there is some stumbling-block that he sticks fast at. Don&rsquo;t you remember
      those sums, and those declensions? When he is so clear and sensible about
      practical matters too&mdash;anything but learning&mdash;I cannot think why&mdash;and
      it is very mortifying!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say it is very good for us not to have our ambition gratified,&rdquo;
       said her mother. &ldquo;There are so many troubles worse than these failures,
      that it only shows how happy we are that we should take them so much to
      heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are a very real trouble!&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t smile, mamma. Only
      remember how wretched his schooldays were, when papa could not see any
      difficulty in what to him was so hard, and how all papa&rsquo;s eagerness only
      stupified him the more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are a comfort not to have that over again! Yet,&rdquo; said the mother, &ldquo;I
      often think there is more fear for Norman. I dread his talent and success
      being snares.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no self-sufficiency about him,&rdquo; said Margaret.
</p>
    <p>
&ldquo;I hope not, and
      he is so transparent, that it would be laughed down at the first bud: but
      the universal good report, and certainty of success, and being so often
      put in comparison with Richard, is hardly safe. I was very glad he heard
      what Ethel said to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ethel spoke very deeply,&rdquo; said Margaret; &ldquo;I was a good deal struck by it&mdash;she
      often comes out with such solid thoughts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is an excellent companion for Norman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The desire of being first!&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;I suppose that is a form of
      caring for oneself! It set me thinking a good deal, mamma, how many forms
      of ambition there are. The craving for rank, or wealth, or beauty, are so
      clearly wrong, that one does not question about them; but I suppose, as
      Ethel said, the caring to be first in attainments is as bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or in affection,&rdquo; said Mrs. May.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In affection&mdash;oh, mamma, there is always some one person with whom
      one is first!&rdquo; said Margaret eagerly; and then, her colour deepening, as
      she saw her mother looking at her, she said hastily, &ldquo;Ritchie&mdash;I
      never considered it&mdash;but I know&mdash;it is my great pleasure&mdash;oh,
      mamma!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear, I do not say but that you are the first with Richard, and
      that you well deserve to be so; but is the seeking to be the first even in
      that way safe? Is it not self-seeking again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, perhaps it is. I know it is what makes jealousy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The only plan is not to think about ourselves at all,&rdquo; said Mrs. May.
      &ldquo;Affection is round us like sunshine, and there is no use in measuring and
      comparing. We must give it out freely ourselves, hoping for nothing
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, mamma, you don&rsquo;t mean that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I should have said, bargaining for nothing again. It will come of
      itself, if we don&rsquo;t exact it; but rivalry is the sure means of driving it
      away, because that is trying to get oneself worshipped.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose, then, you have never thought of it,&rdquo; said Margaret, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it would have been rather absurd,&rdquo; said Mrs. May, laughing, &ldquo;to
      begin to torment myself whether you were all fond of me! You all have just
      as much affection for me, from beginning to end, as is natural, and what&rsquo;s
      the use of thinking about it? No, no, Margaret, don&rsquo;t go and protest that
      you love me, more than is natural,&rdquo; as Margaret looked inclined to say
      something very eager, &ldquo;that would be in the style of Regan and Goneril. It
      will be natural by-and-by that you should, some of you, love some one else
      better, and if I cared for being first, what should I do then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, mamma! But,&rdquo; said Margaret suddenly, &ldquo;you are always sure of papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In one way, yes,&rdquo; said Mrs. May; &ldquo;but how do I know how long&mdash;&rdquo; Calm
      as she was, she could not finish that sentence. &ldquo;No, Margaret, depend upon
      it, the only security is not to think about ourselves at all, and not to
      fix our mind on any affection on earth. The least share of the Love above
      is the fullness of all blessing, and if we seek that first, all these
      things will be added unto us, and are,&rdquo; she whispered, more to herself
      than to Margaret.

      CHAPTER III.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Wee modest crimson-tipped flower,
     Thou&rsquo;st met me in an evil hour,
     For I maun crush amang the stoure
       Thy slender stem.
     To spare thee now is past my power,
       Thou bonnie gem.
                               BURNS.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this all the walking party?&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Ernescliffe, as Miss
      Winter, Flora, and Norman gathered in the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harry won&rsquo;t go because of Ethel&rsquo;s spectacles,&rdquo; answered Flora; &ldquo;and Mary
      and he are inseparable, so they are gone with Hector to have a shipwreck
      in the field.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your other sisters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Margaret has ratted&mdash;she is going to drive out with mamma,&rdquo; said
      Norman; &ldquo;as to Etheldred the Unready, I&rsquo;ll run up and hurry her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a moment he was at her door. &ldquo;Oh! Norman, come in. Is it time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think so! You&rsquo;re keeping every one waiting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear! go on; only just tell me the past participle of &lsquo;offero&rsquo;, and
      I&rsquo;ll catch you up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oblatus.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, how stupid. The &lsquo;a&rsquo; long or short? Then that&rsquo;s right. I had such
      a line in my head, I was forced to write it down. Is not it a capital
      subject this time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devotion of Decius? Capital. Let me see!&rdquo; said Norman, taking up a
      paper scribbled in pencil, with Latin verses. &ldquo;Oh, you have taken up quite
      a different line from mine. I began with Mount Vesuvius spouting lava like
      anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Mount Vesuvius didn&rsquo;t spout till it overthrew Pompeii.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Murder!&rdquo; cried Norman, &ldquo;I forgot! It&rsquo;s lucky you put me in mind. I must
      make a fresh beginning. There go my six best lines! However, it was an
      uncanny place, fit for hobgoblins, and shades, and funny customers, which
      will do as well for my purpose. Ha! that&rsquo;s grand about its being so much
      better than the vana gloria triumphalis&mdash;only take care of the
      scanning there&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it was but English. Something like this:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        &ldquo;For what is equal to the fame
         Of forgetting self in the aim?
</pre>
    <p>
      That&rsquo;s not right, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ethel, Norman, what are you about?&rdquo; cried Flora. &ldquo;Do you mean to go to
      Cocksmoor to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; cried Ethel, flying into vehement activity; &ldquo;only I&rsquo;ve lost my
      blue-edged handkerchief&mdash;Flora, have you seen it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but here is your red scarf.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, there is a good Flora. And oh! I finished a frock all but two
      stitches. Where is it gone? Go on, all of you, I&rsquo;ll overtake you:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        &ldquo;Purer than breath of earthly fame,
         Is losing self in a glorious aim.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that better, Norman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll drive us out of patience,&rdquo; said Flora, tying the handkerchief
      round Ethel&rsquo;s throat, and pulling out the fingers of her gloves, which, of
      course, were inside out; &ldquo;are you ready?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my frock! my frock! There &lsquo;tis&mdash;three stitches&mdash;go on, and
      I&rsquo;ll come,&rdquo; said Ethel, seizing a needle, and sewing vehemently at a
      little pink frock. &ldquo;Go on, Miss Winter goes slowly up the hill, and I&rsquo;ll
      overtake you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Norman, then; it is the only way to make her come at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall wait for her,&rdquo; said Norman. &ldquo;Go on, Flora, we shall catch you up
      in no time;&rdquo; and, as Flora went, he continued, &ldquo;Never mind your aims and
      fames and trumpery English rhymes. Your verses will be much the best,
      Ethel; I only went on a little about Mount Vesuvius and the landscape, as
      Alan described it the other day, and Decius taking a last look, knowing he
      was to die. I made him beg his horse&rsquo;s pardon, and say how they will both
      be remembered, and their self-devotion would inspire Romans to all
      posterity, and shout with a noble voice!&rdquo; said Norman, repeating some of
      his lines, correcting them as he proceeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes; but oh, dear, I&rsquo;ve done! Come along,&rdquo; said Ethel, crumpling her
      work into a bundle, and snatching up her gloves; then, as they ran
      downstairs, and emerged into the street, &ldquo;It is a famous subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you have made a capital beginning. If you won&rsquo;t break down
      somewhere, as you always do, with some frightful false quantity, that you
      would get an imposition for, if you were a boy. I wish you were. I should
      like to see old Hoxton&rsquo;s face, if you were to show him up some of these
      verses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what, Norman, if I was you, I would not make Decius flatter
      himself with the fame he was to get&mdash;it is too like the stuff every
      one talks in stupid books. I want him to say&mdash;Rome&mdash;my country&mdash;the
      eagles&mdash;must win, if they do&mdash;never mind what becomes of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why should he not like to get the credit of it, as he did? Fame and
      glory&mdash;they are the spirit of life, the reward of such a death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, no,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;Fame is coarse and vulgar&mdash;blinder than
      ever they draw Love or Fortune&mdash;she is only a personified newspaper,
      trumpeting out all that is extraordinary, without minding whether it is
      good or bad. She misses the delicate and lovely&mdash;I wished they would
      give us a theme to write about her. I should like to abuse her well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would make a very good theme, in a new line,&rdquo; said Norman; &ldquo;but I
      don&rsquo;t give into it, altogether. It is the hope and the thought of fame,
      that has made men great, from first to last. It is in every one that is
      not good for nothing, and always will be! The moving spirit of man&rsquo;s
      greatness!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure,&rdquo; said Ethel; &ldquo;I think looking for fame is like wanting a
      reward at once. I had rather people forgot themselves. Do you think Arnold
      von Winkelried thought about fame when he threw himself on the spears?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He got it,&rdquo; said Norman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; he got it for the good of other people, not to please himself. Fame
      does those that admire it good, not those that win it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But!&rdquo; said Norman, and both were silent for some short interval, as they
      left the last buildings of the town, and began to mount a steep hill.
      Presently Norman slackened his pace, and driving his stick vehemently
      against a stone, exclaimed, &ldquo;It is no use talking, Ethel, it is all a
      fight and a race. One is always to try to be foremost. That&rsquo;s the spirit
      of the thing&mdash;that&rsquo;s what the great, from first to last, have
      struggled, and fought, and lived, and died for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it is a battle, I know it is a race. The Bible says so,&rdquo; replied
      Ethel; &ldquo;but is not there the difference, that here all may win&mdash;not
      only one? One may do one&rsquo;s best, not care whether one is first or last.
      That&rsquo;s what our reading to-day said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was against trumpery vanity&mdash;false elevation&mdash;not what one
      has earned for oneself, but getting into other people&rsquo;s places that one
      never deserved. That every one despises!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course! That they do. I say, Norman, didn&rsquo;t you mean Harvey Anderson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Instead of answering, Norman exclaimed, &ldquo;It is pretension that is hateful&mdash;true
      excelling is what one&rsquo;s life is for. No, no, I&rsquo;ll never be beat, Ethel&mdash;I
      never have been beat by any one, except by you, when you take pains,&rdquo; he
      added, looking exultingly at his sister, &ldquo;and I never will be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Norman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean, of course, while I have senses. I would not be like Richard for
      all the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, no, poor Richard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is an excellent fellow in everything else,&rdquo; said Norman; &ldquo;I could
      sometimes wish I was more like him&mdash;but how he can be so amazingly
      slow, I can&rsquo;t imagine. That examination paper he broke down in&mdash;I
      could have done it as easily as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did it all but one question,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;but so did he, you know, and
      we can&rsquo;t tell whether we should have it done well enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know I must do something respectable when first I go to Oxford, if I
      don&rsquo;t wish to be known as the man whose brother was plucked,&rdquo; said Norman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ethel; &ldquo;if papa will but let you try for the Randall
      scholarship next year, but he says it is not good to go to Oxford so
      young.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I believe I had better not be there with Richard,&rdquo; added Norman. &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t like coming into contrast with him, and I don&rsquo;t think he can like
      it, poor fellow, and it isn&rsquo;t his fault. I had rather stay another year
      here, get one of the open scholarships, and leave the Stoneborough ones
      for those who can do no better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In justice to Norman, we must observe that this was by no means said as a
      boast. He would scarcely have thus spoken to any one but Etheldred, to
      whom, as well as to himself, it seemed mere matter-of-fact. The others had
      in the meantime halted at the top of the hill, and were looking back at
      the town&mdash;the great old Minster, raising its twin towers and long
      roof, close to the river, where rich green meadows spread over the valley,
      and the town rising irregularly on the slope above, plentifully
      interspersed with trees and gardens, and one green space on the banks of
      the river, speckled over with a flock of little black dots in rapid
      motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here you are!&rdquo; exclaimed Flora. &ldquo;I told them it was of no use to wait
      when you and Norman had begun a dissertation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Mr. Ernescliffe, I should like you to say,&rdquo; cried Ethel, &ldquo;which do
      you think is the best, the name of it, or the thing?&rdquo; Her eloquence always
      broke down with any auditor but her brother, or, perhaps, Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ethel!&rdquo; said Norman, &ldquo;how is any one to understand you? The argument is
      this: Ethel wants people to do great deeds, and be utterly careless of the
      fame of them; I say, that love of glory is a mighty spring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A mighty one!&rdquo; said Alan: &ldquo;but I think, as far as I understand the
      question, that Ethel has the best of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean that people should not serve the cause first of all,&rdquo; said
      Norman, &ldquo;but let them have their right place and due honour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They had better make up their minds to do without it,&rdquo; said Alan.
      &ldquo;Remember&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       &lsquo;The world knows nothing of its greatest men.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it is a great shame,&rdquo; said Norman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But do you think it right,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;to care for distinction? It is a
      great thing to earn it, but I don&rsquo;t think one should care for the outer
      glory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe it is a great temptation,&rdquo; said Alan. &ldquo;The being over-elated or
      over-depressed by success or failure in the eyes of the world,
      independently of the exertion we have used.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You call it a temptation?&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Decidedly so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But one can&rsquo;t live or get on without it,&rdquo; said Norman.
    </p>
    <p>
      There they were cut short. There was a plantation to be crossed, with a
      gate that would not open, and that seemed an effectual barrier against
      both Miss Winter and the donkey, until by persuasive eloquence and great
      gallantry, Mr. Ernescliffe performed the wonderful feat of getting the
      former over the tall fence, while Norman conducted the donkey a long way
      round, undertaking to meet them at the other side of the plantation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The talk became desultory, as they proceeded for at least a mile along a
      cart-track through soft-tufted grass and heath and young fir-trees. It
      ended in a broad open moor, stony; and full of damp boggy hollows, forlorn
      and desolate under the autumn sky. Here they met Norman again, and walked
      on along a very rough and dirty road, the ground growing more decidedly
      into hills and valleys as they advanced, till they found themselves before
      a small, but very steep hillock, one side of which was cut away into a
      slate quarry. Round this stood a colony of roughly-built huts, of mud,
      turf, or large blocks of the slate. Many workmen were engaged in splitting
      up the slates, or loading wagons with them, rude wild-looking men, at the
      sight of whom the ladies shrank up to their protectors, but who seemed too
      busy even to spare time for staring at them.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were directed to John Taylor&rsquo;s house, a low mud cottage, very
      wretched looking, and apparently so smoky that Mr. Ernescliffe and Norman
      were glad to remain outside and survey the quarry, while the ladies
      entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside they found more cleanliness and neatness than they had expected,
      but there was a sad appearance of poverty, insufficient furniture, and the
      cups and broken tea-pot on the table, holding nothing but toast and water,
      as a substitute for their proper contents. The poor woman was sitting by
      the fire with one twin on her lap, and the other on a chair by her side,
      and a larger child was in the corner by the fire, looking heavy and ill,
      while others of different ages lounged about listlessly. She was not
      untidy, but very pale, and she spoke in a meek, subdued way, as if the
      ills of life were so heavy on her that she had no spirit even to complain.
      She thanked them for their gifts but languidly, and did not visibly
      brighten when told that her husband was better.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora asked when the babes would be christened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t hardly tell, Miss&mdash;&lsquo;tis so far to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose none of the children can go to school? I don&rsquo;t know their faces
      there,&rdquo; said Flora, looking at a nice tall, smooth-haired girl of thirteen
      or fourteen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Miss&mdash;&lsquo;tis so far. I am sorry they should not, for they always
      was used to it where we lived before, and my oldest girl she can work very
      nicely. I wish I could get a little place for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would hardly know what to do without her,&rdquo; said Miss Winter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, ma&rsquo;am; but she wants better food than I can give her, and it is a bad
      wild place for a girl to grow up. It is not like what I was used to,
      ma&rsquo;am; I was always used to keep to my school and to my church&mdash;but
      it is a bad place to live in here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No one could deny it, and the party left the cottage gravely. Alan and
      Norman joined them, having heard a grievous history of the lawlessness of
      the people from a foreman with whom they had met. There seemed to be no
      visible means of improvement. The parish church was Stoneborough, and
      there the living was very poor, the tithes having been appropriated to the
      old Monastery, and since its dissolution having fallen into possession of
      a Body that never did anything for the town. The incumbent, Mr. Ramsden,
      had small means, and was not a high stamp of clergyman, seldom exerting
      himself, and leaving most of his parish work to the two under masters of
      the school, Mr. Wilmot and Mr. Harrison, who did all they had time and
      strength for, and more too, within the town itself. There was no hope for
      Cocksmoor!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There would be a worthy ambition!&rdquo; said Etheldred, as they turned their
      steps homeward. &ldquo;Let us propose that aim to ourselves, to build a church
      on Cocksmoor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many years do you give us to do it in?&rdquo; said Norman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Few or many, I don&rsquo;t care. I&rsquo;ll never leave off thinking about it till it
      is done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It need not be long,&rdquo; said Flora, &ldquo;if one could get up a subscription.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A penny subscription?&rdquo; said Norman. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather have it my own doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You agree then,&rdquo; said Ethel; &ldquo;do you, Mr. Ernescliffe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may safely do so,&rdquo; he answered, smiling. Miss Winter looked at
      Etheldred reprovingly, and she shrank into herself, drew apart, and
      indulged in a reverie. She had heard in books of girls writing poetry,
      romance, history&mdash;gaining fifties and hundreds. Could not some of the
      myriads of fancies floating in her mind thus be made available? She would
      compose, publish, earn money&mdash;some day call papa, show him her hoard,
      beg him to take it, and, never owning whence it came, raise the building.
      Spire and chancel, pinnacle and buttress, rose before her eyes, and she
      and Norman were standing in the porch with an orderly, religious
      population, blessing the unknown benefactor, who had caused the news of
      salvation to be heard among them.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were almost at home, when the sight of a crowd in the main street
      checked them. Norman and Mr. Ernescliffe went forward to discover the
      cause, and spoke to some one on the outskirts&mdash;then Mr. Ernescliffe
      hurried back to the ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s been an accident,&rdquo; he said hastily&mdash;&ldquo;you had better go down
      the lane and in by the garden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was gone in an instant, and they obeyed in silence. Whence came Ethel&rsquo;s
      certainty that the accident concerned themselves? In an agony of
      apprehension, though without one outward sign of it, she walked home. They
      were in the garden&mdash;all was apparently as usual, but no one was in
      sight. Ethel had been first, but she held back, and let Miss Winter go
      forward into the house. The front door was open&mdash;servants were
      standing about in confusion, and one of the maids, looking dreadfully
      frightened, gave a cry, &ldquo;Oh! Miss&mdash;Miss&mdash;have you heard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;what? What has happened? Not Mrs. May&mdash;&rdquo; exclaimed Miss
      Winter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, ma&rsquo;am! it is all of them. The carriage is overturned, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s hurt? Mamma! papa! Oh, tell me!&rdquo; cried Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nurse,&rdquo; and Ethel flew up to her. &ldquo;What is it? Oh, nurse!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor, poor children,&rdquo; said old nurse, passionately kissing Ethel.
      Harry and Mary were on the stairs behind her, clinging together.
    </p>
    <p>
      A stranger looked into the house, followed by Adams, the stableman. &ldquo;They
      are going to bring Miss May in,&rdquo; some one said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel could bear it no longer. As if she could escape, she fled upstairs
      into her room, and, falling on her knees, hid her face on her bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were heavy steps in the house, then a sound of hasty feet coming up
      to her. Norman dashed into the room, and threw himself on a chair. He was
      ghastly pale, and shuddered all over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Norman, Norman, speak! What is it?&rdquo; He groaned, but could not speak;
      he rested his head against her, and gasped. She was terribly frightened.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call&mdash;&rdquo; and she would have gone, but he held her. &ldquo;No&mdash;no&mdash;they
      can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; He was prevented from saying more, by chattering teeth and deadly
      faintness. She tried to support him, but could only guide him as he sank,
      till he lay at full length on the floor, where she put a pillow under his
      head, and gave him some water. &ldquo;Is it&mdash;oh, tell me! Are they much
      hurt? Oh, try to say!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say Margaret is alive,&rdquo; said Norman, in gasps; &ldquo;but&mdash;And papa&mdash;he
      stood up&mdash;sat&mdash;walked&mdash;was better-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he hurt&mdash;much hurt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His arm&mdash;&rdquo; and the tremor and fainting stopped him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma?&rdquo; whispered Ethel; but Norman only pressed his face into the
      pillow.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was so bewildered as to be more alive to the present distress of his
      condition than to the vague horrors downstairs. Some minutes passed in
      silence, Norman lying still, excepting a nervous trembling that agitated
      his whole frame. Again was heard the strange tread, doors opening and
      shutting, and suppressed voices, and he turned his face upwards, and
      listened with his hand pressed to his forehead, as if to keep himself
      still enough to listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! what is the matter? What is it?&rdquo; cried Ethel, startled and recalled
      to the sense of what was passing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Norman!&rdquo; Then springing up, with a sudden thought, &ldquo;Mr. Ward! Oh! is
      he there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Norman, in a low hopeless tone, &ldquo;he was at the place. He said
      it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Norman&rsquo;s face was out of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma?&rdquo; Ethel&rsquo;s understanding perceived, but her mind refused to grasp
      the extent of the calamity. There was no answer, save a convulsive
      squeezing of her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fresh sounds below recalled her to speech and action.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is she? What are they doing for her? What&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to be done. She&mdash;when they lifted her up, she was&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy lay with his face hidden, the girl sat by him on the floor, too
      much crushed for even the sensations belonging to grief, neither moving
      nor looking. After an interval Norman spoke again, &ldquo;The carriage turned
      right over&mdash;her head struck on the kerb stone&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you see?&rdquo; said Ethel presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw them lift her up.&rdquo; He spoke at intervals, as he could get breath
      and bear to utter the words. &ldquo;And papa&mdash;he was stunned&mdash;but soon
      he sat up, said he would go to her&mdash;he looked at her&mdash;felt her
      pulse, and then&mdash;sank down over her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And did you say&mdash;I can&rsquo;t remember&mdash;was he hurt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The shuddering came again, &ldquo;His arm&mdash;all twisted&mdash;broken,&rdquo; and
      his voice sank into a faint whisper; Ethel was obliged to sprinkle him
      again with water. &ldquo;But he won&rsquo;t die?&rdquo; said she, in a tone calm from its
      bewilderment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! no, no, no&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Margaret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were bringing her home. I&rsquo;ll go and see. Oh! what&rsquo;s the meaning of
      this?&rdquo; exclaimed he, scolding himself, as, sitting up, he was forced to
      rest his head on his shaking hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are still faint, dear Norman; you had better lie still, and I&rsquo;ll go
      and see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faint&mdash;stuff&mdash;how horridly stupid!&rdquo; but he was obliged to lay
      his head down again; and Ethel, scarcely less trembling, crept carefully
      towards the stairs, but a dread of what she might meet came over her, and
      she turned towards the nursery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The younger ones sat there in a frightened huddle. Mary was on a low chair
      by the infant&rsquo;s cot, Blanche in her lap, Tom and Harry leaning against
      her, and Aubrey almost asleep. Mary held up her finger as Ethel entered,
      and whispered, &ldquo;Hush! don&rsquo;t wake baby for anything!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The first true pang of grief shot through Ethel like a dart, stabbing and
      taking away her breath, &ldquo;Where are they?&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;how is papa? who is
      with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Ward and Alan Ernescliffe,&rdquo; said Harry. &ldquo;Nurse came up just now, and
      said they were setting his arm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the bed in his dressing-room,&rdquo; said Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he come to himself&mdash;is he better?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They did not seem to know, and Ethel asked where to find Flora. &ldquo;With
      Margaret,&rdquo; she was told, and she was thinking whether she could venture to
      seek her, when she herself came fast up the stairs. Ethel and Harry both
      darted out. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stop me,&rdquo; said Flora&mdash;&ldquo;they want some
      handkerchiefs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, is not she in her own room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Harry, &ldquo;in mamma&rsquo;s;&rdquo; and then his face quivered all over, and
      he turned away. Ethel ran after her sister, and pulling out drawers
      without knowing what she sought, begged to hear how papa and Margaret
      were.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t judge of Margaret&mdash;she has moved, and made a little moaning&mdash;there
      are no limbs broken, but we are afraid for her head. Oh! if papa could but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And papa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Ward is with him now&mdash;his arm is terribly hurt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But oh! Flora&mdash;one moment&mdash;is he sensible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hardly; he does not take any notice&mdash;but don&rsquo;t keep me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I do anything?&rdquo; following her to the head of the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I don&rsquo;t see what you can do. Miss Winter and I are with Margaret;
      there&rsquo;s nothing to do for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a relief. Etheldred shrank from what she might have to behold, and
      Flora hastened down, too busy and too useful to have time to think. Harry
      had gone back to his refuge in the nursery, and Ethel returned to Norman.
      There they remained for a long time, both unwilling to speak or stir, or
      even to observe to each other on the noises that came in to them, as their
      door was left ajar, though in those sounds they were so absorbed, that
      they did not notice the cold of a frosty October evening, or the darkness
      that closed in on them.
    </p>
    <p>
      They heard the poor babe crying, one of the children going down to call
      nurse, and nurse coming up; then Harry, at the door of the room where the
      boys slept, calling Norman in a low voice. Norman, now nearly recovered,
      went and brought him into his sister&rsquo;s room, and his tidings were, that
      their father&rsquo;s arm had been broken in two places, and the elbow
      frightfully injured, having been crushed and twisted by the wheel. He was
      also a good deal bruised, and though Mr. Ward trusted there was no
      positive harm to the head, he was in an unconscious state, from which the
      severe pain of the operation had only roused him, so far as to evince a
      few signs of suffering. Margaret was still insensible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The piteous sound of the baby&rsquo;s wailing almost broke their hearts. Norman
      walked about the room in the dark, and said he should go down, he could
      not bear it; but he could not make up his mind to go, and after about a
      quarter of an hour, to their great relief, it ceased.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next Mary opened the door, saying, &ldquo;Norman, here&rsquo;s Mr. Wilmot come to ask
      if he can do anything&mdash;Miss Winter sent word that you had better go
      to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is baby?&rdquo; asked Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nurse has fed her, and is putting her to bed; she is quiet now,&rdquo; said
      Mary; &ldquo;will you go down, Norman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the drawing-room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norman paused to ask what he was to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said Mary, &ldquo;nobody can do anything. Make haste. Don&rsquo;t you want
      a candle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you, I had rather be in the dark. Come up as soon as you have
      seen him,&rdquo; said Etheldred.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norman went slowly down, with failing knees, hardly able to conquer the
      shudder that came over him, as he passed those rooms. There were voices in
      the drawing-room, and he found a sort of council there, Alan Ernescliffe,
      the surgeon, and Mr. Wilmot. They turned as he came in, and Mr. Wilmot
      held out his hand with a look of affection and kindness that went to his
      heart, making room for him on the sofa, while going on with what he was
      saying. &ldquo;Then you think it would be better for me not to sit up with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should decidedly say so,&rdquo; replied Mr. Ward. &ldquo;He has recognised Mr.
      Ernescliffe, and any change might excite him, and lead him to ask
      questions. The moment of his full consciousness is especially to be
      dreaded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you do not call him insensible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but he seems stunned&mdash;stupified by the shock, and by pain. He
      spoke to Miss Flora when she brought him some tea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And admirably she managed,&rdquo; said Alan Ernescliffe. &ldquo;I was much afraid of
      some answer that would rouse him, but she kept her self-possession
      beautifully, and seemed to compose him in a moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is valuable indeed&mdash;so much judgment and activity,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Ward. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what we should have done without her. But we ought to
      have Mr. Richard&mdash;has no one sent to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alan Ernescliffe and Norman looked at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he at Oxford, or at his tutor&rsquo;s?&rdquo; asked Mr. Wilmot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Oxford; he was to be there to-day, was he not, Norman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What o&rsquo;clock is it? Is the post gone&mdash;seven&mdash;no; it is all
      safe,&rdquo; said Mr. Ward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Norman! he knew he was the one who ought to write, but his icy
      trembling hand seemed to shake more helplessly than ever, and a piteous
      glance fell upon Mr. Wilmot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The best plan would be,&rdquo; said Mr. Wilmot, &ldquo;for me to go to him at once
      and bring him home. If I go by the mail-train, I shall get to him sooner
      than a letter could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it will be better for him,&rdquo; said Mr. Ward. &ldquo;He will feel it
      dreadfully, poor boy. But we shall all do better when we have him. You can
      get back to-morrow evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sunday,&rdquo; said Mr. Wilmot, &ldquo;I believe there is a train at four.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! thank you, sir,&rdquo; said Norman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since that is settled, perhaps I had better go up to the doctor,&rdquo; said
      Alan; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like leaving Flora alone with him,&rdquo; and he was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How fortunate that that youth is here,&rdquo; said Mr. Wilmot&mdash;&ldquo;he seems
      to be quite taking Richard&rsquo;s place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to feel it as much,&rdquo; said Mr. Ward. &ldquo;He has been invaluable with his
      sailor&rsquo;s resources and handiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what shall I tell poor Richard?&rdquo; asked Mr. Wilmot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell him there is no reason his father should not do very well, if we can
      keep him from agitation&mdash;but there&rsquo;s the point. He is of so excitable
      a constitution, that his faculties being so far confused is the best
      thing, perhaps, that could be. Mr. Ernescliffe manages him very well&mdash;used
      to illness on that African coast, and the doctor is very fond of him. As
      to Miss May, one can&rsquo;t tell what to say about her yet&mdash;there&rsquo;s no
      fracture, at least&mdash;it must be a work of time to judge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flora at that moment half-opened the door, and called Mr. Ward, stopping
      for a moment to say it was for nothing of any consequence. Mr. Wilmot and
      Norman were left together. Norman put his hands over his face and groaned&mdash;his
      master looked at him with kind anxiety, but did not feel as if it were yet
      time to speak of consolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless and support you, and turn this to your good, my dear boy,&rdquo; said
      he affectionately, as he pressed his hand; &ldquo;I hope to bring your brother
      to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; was all Norman could say; and as Mr. Wilmot went out by
      the front door, he slowly went up again, and, lingering on the
      landing-place, was met by Mr. Ward, who told him to his relief&mdash;for
      the mere thinking of it renewed the faint sensation&mdash;that he had
      better not go to his father&rsquo;s room.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing to be done but to return to Ethel and Harry, and tell
      them all; with some humiliation at being helpless, where Flora was doing
      so much, and to leave their father to be watched by a stranger. If he had
      been wanted, Norman might have made the effort, but being told that he
      would be worse than useless, there was nothing for him but to give way.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat together in Ethel&rsquo;s room till somewhere between eight and nine
      o&rsquo;clock, when good old nurse, having put her younger ones to bed, came in
      search of them. &ldquo;Dear, dear! poor darlings,&rdquo; said she, as she found them
      sitting in the dark; she felt their cold hands, and made them all come
      into the nursery, where Mary was already, and, fondling them, one by one,
      as they passively obeyed her, she set them down on their little old stools
      round the fire, took away the high fender, and gave them each a cup of
      tea. Harry and Mary ate enough to satisfy her, from a weary craving
      feeling, and for want of employment; Norman sat with his elbow on his
      knee, and a very aching head resting on his hand, glad of drink, but
      unable to eat; Ethel could be persuaded to do neither, till she found old
      nurse would let her have no peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nurse sent them all to bed, taking the two girls to their own room,
      undressing them, and never leaving them until Mary was in a fair way of
      crying herself to sleep&mdash;for saying her prayers had brought the
      tears; while Ethel lay so wide awake that it was of no use to wait for
      her, and then she went to the boys, tucked them each in, as when they were
      little children, and saying, &ldquo;Bless your dear hearts!&rdquo; bestowed on each of
      them a kiss which came gratefully to Norman&rsquo;s burning brow, and which even
      Harry&rsquo;s boyish manliness could not resist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora was in Margaret&rsquo;s room, too useful to be spared.
    </p>
    <p>
      So ended that dreadful Saturday.

      CHAPTER IV.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     They may not mar the deep repose
       Of that immortal flower:
     Though only broken hearts are found
       To watch her cradle by,
     No blight is on her slumbers found,
       No touch of harmful eye.
                                    LYRA INNOCENTIUM.
</pre>
    <p>
      Such a strange sad Sunday! No going to church, but all the poor children
      moving in awe and oppression about the house, speaking under their breath,
      as they gathered in the drawing-room. Into the study they might not go,
      and when Blanche would have asked why, Tom pressed her hand and shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Etheldred was allowed to come and look at Margaret, and even to sit in the
      room for a little while, to take the place of Miss Winter; but she was not
      sensible of sufficient usefulness to relieve the burden of fear and
      bewilderment in the presence of that still, pale form; and, what was
      almost worse, the sight of the familiar objects, the chair by the fire,
      the sofa, the books, the work-basket, the letter-case, the dressing
      things, all these were too oppressive. She sat crouched up, with her face
      hidden in her hands, and the instant she was released, hastened back to
      Norman. She was to tell him that he might go into the room, but he did not
      move, and Mary alone went in and out with messages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. May was not to be visited, for he was in the same half-conscious
      state, apparently sensible only of bodily suffering, though he answered
      when addressed, and no one was trusted to speak to him but Flora and
      Ernescliffe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest wore through the day as best they might. Harry slept a good deal,
      Ethel read to herself, and tried to get Norman to look at passages which
      she liked, Mary kept the little ones from being troublesome, and at last
      took them to peep behind the school-room blinds for Richard&rsquo;s coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a simultaneous shout when, at four o&rsquo;clock, they caught sight of
      him, and though, at Ethel&rsquo;s exclamation of wonder, Mary and Tom hung their
      heads at having forgotten themselves, the association of gladness in
      seeing Richard was refreshing; the sense of being desolate and forsaken
      was relieved, and they knew that now they had one to rely on and to
      comfort them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry hastened to open the front door, and Richard, with his small trim
      figure, and fresh, fair young face, flushed, though not otherwise
      agitated, was among them, almost devoured by the younger ones, and dealing
      out quiet caresses to them, as he caught from the words and looks of the
      others that at least his father and sister were no worse. Mr. Wilmot had
      come with him, but only stayed to hear the tidings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I see papa?&rdquo; were Richard&rsquo;s first audible words&mdash;all the rest
      had been almost dumb show.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel thought not, but took him to Margaret&rsquo;s room, where he stood for
      many minutes without speaking; then whispered to Flora that he must go to
      the others, she should call him if&mdash;and went down, followed by Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom and Blanche had fallen into teasing tricks, a sort of melancholy play
      to relieve the tedium. They grew cross. Norman was roused to reprove
      sharply, and Blanche was beginning to cry. But Richard&rsquo;s entrance set all
      at peace&mdash;he sat down among them, and, with soft voice and arm round
      Blanche, as she leaned against him, made her good in a moment; and she
      listened while he talked over with Norman and Ethel all they could bear to
      speak of.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late in the day Flora came into her father&rsquo;s room, and stood gazing at
      him, as he lay with eyes closed, breathing heavily, and his brows
      contracted by pain. She watched him with piteous looks, as if imploring
      him to return to his children. Poor girl, to-day&rsquo;s quiet, after the last
      evening&rsquo;s bustle, was hard to bear. She had then been distracted from
      thought by the necessity of exertion, but it now repaid itself, and she
      knew not how to submit to do nothing but wait and watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No change?&rdquo; enquired Alan Ernescliffe; looking kindly in her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied she in a low, mournful tone. &ldquo;She only once said, thank
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A voice which she did not expect, asked inquiringly, &ldquo;Margaret?&rdquo; and her
      heart beat as if it would take away her breath, as she saw her father&rsquo;s
      eyes intently fixed on her. &ldquo;Did you speak of her?&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear papa,&rdquo; said Flora, not losing presence of mind, though in
      extreme fear of what the next question might be. &ldquo;She is quiet and
      comfortable, so don&rsquo;t be uneasy, pray.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me hear,&rdquo; he said, and his whole voice and air showed him to be
      entirely roused. &ldquo;There is injury? What is it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He continued his inquiries till Flora was obliged fully to explain her
      sister&rsquo;s condition, and then he dismayed her by saying he would get up and
      go to see her. Much distressed, she begged him not to think of it, and
      appealed to Alan, who added his entreaties that he would at least wait for
      Mr. Ward; but the doctor would not relinquish his purpose, and sent her to
      give notice that he was coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ernescliffe followed her out of the room, and tried to console her, as
      she looked at him in despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see he is quite himself, quite collected,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you heard now
      clear and coherent his questions were.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t it be helped? Do try to stop him till I can send to Mr. Ward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will try, but I think he is in a state to judge for himself. I do, upon
      my word; and I believe trying to prevent him would be more likely to do
      him harm than letting him satisfy himself. I really think you need not be
      alarmed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you know,&rdquo; said Flora, coming nearer, and almost gasping as she
      whispered and signed towards the door, &ldquo;she is there&mdash;it is mamma&rsquo;s
      room, that will tell all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe he knows,&rdquo; said Alan. &ldquo;It was that which made him faint after
      the accident, for he had his perceptions fully at first. I have suspected
      all day that he was more himself than he seemed, but I think he could not
      bear to awaken his mind to understand it, and that he was afraid to hear
      about her&mdash;your sister, so that our mention of her was a great
      relief, and did him good. I am convinced he knows the rest. Only go on, be
      calm, as you have been, and we shall do very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flora went to prepare. Ethel eagerly undertook to send to Mr. Ward, and
      hastened from the room, as if in a sort of terror, shrinking perhaps from
      what might lead to an outburst of grief. She longed to have seen her
      father, but was frightened at the chance of meeting him. When she had sent
      her message, and told her brothers what was passing, she went and lingered
      on the stairs and in the passage for tidings. After what seemed a long
      time, Flora came out, and hastened to the nursery, giving her intelligence
      on the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better than could be hoped, he walked alone into the room, and was quite
      calm and composed. Oh! if this will not hurt him, if the seeing baby was
      but over!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he want her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he would have come up here himself, but I would not let him. Nurse,
      do you hear? Papa wants baby; let me have her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless me, Miss Flora, you can&rsquo;t hold her while you are all of a tremble!
      And he has been to Miss Margaret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, nurse, and he was only rather stiff and lame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did Margaret seem to know him?&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She just answered in that dreamy way when he spoke to her. He says he
      thinks it is as Mr. Ward believes, and that she will soon come to herself.
      He is quite able to consider&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he knows all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure he does. He desired to see baby, and he wants you, nurse. Only
      mind you command yourself&mdash;don&rsquo;t say a word you can help&mdash;do
      nothing to agitate him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nurse promised, but the tears came so fast, and sobs with them, as she
      approached her master&rsquo;s room, that Flora saw no composure could be
      expected from her; and taking the infant from her, carried it in, leaving
      the door open for her to follow when wanted. Ethel stood by listening.
      There was silence at first, then some sounds from the baby, and her
      father&rsquo;s voice soothing it, in his wonted caressing phrases and tones, so
      familiar that they seemed to break the spell, drive away her vague
      terrors, and restore her father. Her heart bounded, and a sudden impulse
      carried her to the bedside, at once forgetting all dread of seeing him,
      and chance of doing him harm. He lay, holding the babe close to him, and
      his face was not altered, so that there was nothing in the sight to
      impress her with the need of caution, and, to the consternation of the
      anxious Flora, she exclaimed, abruptly and vehemently, &ldquo;Papa! should not
      she be christened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. May looked up at Ethel, then at the infant; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;at once.&rdquo;
       Then added feebly and languidly, &ldquo;Some one must see to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause, while Flora looked reproachfully at her sister, and
      Ethel became conscious of her imprudence, but in a few moments Dr. May
      spoke again, first to the baby, and then asking, &ldquo;Is Richard here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send him up presently. Where&rsquo;s nurse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel retreated, much alarmed at her rash measure, and when she related it
      she saw that Richard and Mr. Ernescliffe both thought it had been a great
      hazard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa wants you,&rdquo; was a welcome sound to the ears of Richard, and brought
      a pink glow into his face. He was never one who readily showed his
      feelings, and there was no danger of his failing in self-command, though
      grievously downcast, not only at the loss of the tender mother, who had
      always stood between him and his father&rsquo;s impatience, but by the dread
      that he was too dull and insignificant to afford any help or comfort in
      his father&rsquo;s dire affliction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet there was something in the gentle sad look that met him, and in the
      low tone of the &ldquo;How d&rsquo;ye do, Ritchie?&rdquo; that drove off a thought of not
      being loved; and when Dr. May further added, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see about it all&mdash;I
      am glad you are come,&rdquo; he knew he was of use, and was encouraged and
      cheered. That his father had full confidence and reliance in him, and that
      his presence was a satisfaction and relief he could no longer doubt; and
      this was a drop of balm beyond all his hopes; for loving and admiring his
      father intensely, and with depressed spirits and a low estimate of
      himself, he had begun to fancy himself incapable of being anything but a
      vexation and burden.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat with his father nearly all the evening, and was to remain with him
      at night. The rest were comforted by the assurance that Dr. May was still
      calm, and did not seem to have been injured by what had passed. Indeed, it
      seemed as if the violence and suddenness of the shock, together with his
      state of suffering, had deadened his sensations; for there was far less
      agitation about him than could have been thought possible in a man of such
      strong, warm affections and sensitive temperament.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel and Norman went up arm-in-arm at bedtime.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to ask if I may wish papa good-night,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;Shall I
      say anything about your coming?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norman hesitated, but his cheeks blanched; he shuddered, shook his head
      without speaking, ran up after Harry, and waved her back when she would
      have followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard told her that she might come in, and, as she slowly advanced, she
      thought she had never seen anything so ineffably mournful as the
      affectionate look on her father&rsquo;s face. She held his hand and ventured&mdash;for
      it was with difficulty she spoke&mdash;to hope he was not in pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better than it was, thank you, my dear,&rdquo; he said, in a soft weak tone:
      then, as she bent down to kiss his brow; &ldquo;you must take care of the little
      ones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, papa,&rdquo; she could hardly answer, and a large drop gathered slowly in
      each eye, long in coming, as if the heart ached too much for them to flow
      freely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are they all well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And good?&rdquo; He held her hand, as if lengthening the interview.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, very good all day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A long deep sigh. Ethel&rsquo;s two tears stood on her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My love to them all. I hope I shall see them to-morrow. God bless you, my
      dear, good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel went upstairs, saddened and yet soothed. The calm silent sorrow, too
      deep for outward tokens, was so unlike her father&rsquo;s usually demonstrative
      habits, as to impress her all the more, yet those two tears were followed
      by no more; there was much strangeness and confusion in her mind in the
      newness of grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      She found poor Flora, spent with exertion, under the reaction of all she
      had undergone, lying on her bed, sobbing as if her heart would break,
      calling in gasps of irrepressible agony on &ldquo;mamma! mamma!&rdquo; yet with her
      face pressed down on the pillow that she might not be heard. Ethel,
      terrified and distressed, timidly implored her to be comforted, but it
      seemed as if she were not even heard; she would have fetched some one, but
      whom? Alas! alas! it brought back the sense that no mother would ever
      soothe them&mdash;Margaret, papa, both so ill, nurse engaged with
      Margaret! Ethel stood helpless and despairing, and Flora sobbed on, so
      that Mary awakened to burst out in a loud frightened fit of crying; but in
      a few moments a step was at the door, a knock, and Richard asked, &ldquo;Is
      anything the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was in the room in a moment, caressing and saying affectionate things
      with gentleness and fondling care, like his mother, and which recalled the
      days when he had been proud to be left for a little while the small nurse
      and guardian of the lesser ones. Mary was hushed in a moment, and Flora&rsquo;s
      exhausted weeping was gradually soothed, when she was able to recollect
      that she was keeping him from her father; with kind good-nights, he left
      Ethel to read to her till she could sleep. Long did Ethel read, after both
      her sisters were slumbering soundly; she went on in a sort of dreamy
      grief, almost devoid of pain, as if all this was too terrible to be true:
      and she had imagined herself into a story, which would give place at dawn
      to her ordinary life.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last she went to bed, and slept till wakened by the return of Flora,
      who had crept down in her dressing-gown to see how matters were going.
      Margaret was in the same state, papa was asleep, after a restless
      distressing night, with much pain and some fever; and whenever Richard had
      begun to hope from his tranquillity, that he was falling asleep, he was
      undeceived by hearing an almost unconsciously uttered sigh of &ldquo;Maggie, my
      Maggie!&rdquo; and then the head turned wearily on the pillow, as if worn out
      with the misery from which there was no escape. Towards morning the pain
      had lessened, and, as he slept, he seemed much less feverish than they
      could have ventured to expect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norman looked wan and wretched, and could taste no breakfast; indeed Harry
      reported that he had been starting and talking in his sleep half the
      night, and had proceeded to groaning and crying out till, when it could be
      borne no longer, Harry waked him, and finished his night&rsquo;s rest in peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The children were kept in the drawing-room that morning, and there were
      strange steps in the house; but only Richard and Mr. Ernescliffe knew the
      reason. Happily there had been witnesses enough of the overturn to spare
      any reference to Dr. May&mdash;the violent start of the horses had been
      seen, and Adams and Mr. Ernescliffe agreed, under their breath, that the
      new black one was not fit to drive, while the whole town was so used to
      Dr. May&rsquo;s headlong driving, that every one was recollecting their own
      predictions of accidents. There needed little to account for the disaster&mdash;the
      only wonder was that it had not happened sooner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say,&rdquo; announced Harry, soon after they were released again, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
      in to papa. His door was open, and he heard me, and called me. He says he
      should like any of us to come in and see him. Hadn&rsquo;t you better go,
      Norman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norman started up, and walked hastily out of the room, but his hand shook
      so, that he could hardly open the door; and Ethel, seeing how it was with
      him, followed him quickly, as he dashed, at full speed, up the stairs. At
      the top, however, he was forced to cling to the rail, gasping for breath,
      while the moisture started on his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Norman,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s nothing to mind. He looks just as usual.
      You would not know there was anything the matter.&rdquo; But he rested his head
      on his hand, and looked as if he could not stir. &ldquo;I see it won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; said
      Ethel&mdash;&ldquo;don&rsquo;t try&mdash;you will be better by-and-by, and he has not
      asked for you in particular.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be beat by such stuff,&rdquo; said Norman, stepping hastily forwards,
      and opening the door suddenly. He got through the greeting pretty well,
      there was no need for him to speak, he only gave his hand and looked away,
      unable to bring himself to turn his eyes on his father, and afraid of
      letting his own face be seen. Almost at the same moment, nurse came to say
      something about Margaret, and he seized the opportunity of withdrawing his
      hand, and hurrying away, in good time, for he was pale as death, and was
      obliged to sit down on the head of the stairs, and lean his head against
      Etheldred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does make me so ridiculous?&rdquo; he exclaimed faintly, but very
      indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first cure was the being forced to clear out of Mr. Ward&rsquo;s way, which
      he could not effect without being seen; and Ethel though she knew that he
      would be annoyed, was not sorry to be obliged to remain, and tell what was
      the matter with him. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Mr. Ward, turning and proceeding to the
      dining-room, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll set that to rights in a minute, if you will ask for a
      tumbler of hot water Miss Ethel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And armed with the cordial he had prepared, Ethel hunted up her brother,
      and persuaded him, after scolding her a little, to swallow it, and take a
      turn in the garden; after which he made a more successful attempt at
      visiting his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was another room whither both Norman and Etheldred wished to go,
      though they dared not hint at their desire. At last Richard came to them,
      as they were wandering in the garden, and, with his usual stillness of
      manner, shaded with additional seriousness, said, &ldquo;Would you like to come
      into the study?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Etheldred put one hand into his, Norman took the other, and soon they
      stood in that calm presence. Fair, cold, white, and intensely still&mdash;that
      face brought home to them the full certainty that the warm brightening
      look would never beam on them, the soft blue eyes never guide, check, and
      watch them, the smile never approve or welcome them. To see her
      unconscious of their presence was too strange and sad, and all were
      silent, till, as they left the room, Ethel looked out at Blanche and
      Aubrey in the garden. &ldquo;They will never remember her! Oh! why should it
      be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard would fain have moralised and comforted, but she felt as if she
      knew it all before, and heard with languid attention. She had rather read
      than talk, and he sat down to write letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were no near relations to be sent for. Dr. May was an only son, and
      his wife&rsquo;s sister, Mrs. Arnott, was in New Zealand; her brother had long
      been dead, and his widow, who lived in Edinburgh, was scarcely known to
      the May family. Of friends there were many, fast bound by affection and
      gratitude, and notes, inquiries, condolences, and offers of service came
      in thickly, and gave much occupation to Flora, Richard, and Alan
      Ernescliffe, in turn. No one from without could do anything for them&mdash;they
      had all the help they wanted in Miss Winter and in Alan, who was
      invaluable in sharing with Richard the care of the doctor, as well as in
      giving him the benefit of his few additional years&rsquo; experience, and
      relieving him of some of his tasks. He was indeed like one of themselves,
      and a most valuable help and comforter. Mr. Wilmot gave them all the time
      he could, and on this day saw the doctor, who seemed to find some solace
      in his visit, though saying very little.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this day the baby was to be baptized. The usual Stoneborough fashion
      was to collect all the christenings for the month into one Sunday, except
      those for such persons as thought themselves too refined to see their
      children christened before the congregation, and who preferred an empty
      church and a week-day. The little one had waited till she was nearly six
      weeks old for &ldquo;a Christening Sunday,&rdquo; and since that had been missed, she
      could not be kept unbaptized for another month; so, late in the day, she
      was carried to church.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard had extremely gratified old nurse, by asking her to represent poor
      Margaret; Mrs. Hoxton stood for the other godmother, and Alan Ernescliffe
      was desired to consider himself absolutely her sponsor, not merely a
      proxy. The younger children alone were to go with them: it was too far
      off, and the way lay too much through the town for it to be thought proper
      for the others to go. Ethel wished it very much, and thought it nonsense
      to care whether people looked at her; and in spite of Miss Winter&rsquo;s
      seeming shocked at her proposing it, had a great mind to persist. She
      would even have appealed to her papa, if Flora had not stopped her,
      exclaiming, &ldquo;Really, Ethel, I think there never was a person so entirely
      without consideration as you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Much abashed, Ethel humbly promised that if she might go into papa&rsquo;s room,
      she would not say one word about the christening, unless he should begin,
      and, to her great satisfaction, he presently asked her to read the service
      to him. Flora came to the doorway of Margaret&rsquo;s room, and listened; when
      she had finished, all were silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How shall we, how can we virtuously bring up our motherless little
      sister?&rdquo; was the thought with each of the girls. The answers were, in one
      mind, &ldquo;I trust we shall do well by her, dear little thing. I see, on an
      emergency, that I know how to act. I never thought I was capable of being
      of so much use, thanks to dear, dear mamma&rsquo;s training. I shall manage, I
      am sure, and so they will all depend on me, and look up to me. How nice it
      was to hear dear papa say what he did about the comfort of my being able
      to look after Margaret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the other, &ldquo;Poor darling, it is saddest of all for her, because she
      knows nothing, and will never remember her mamma! But if Margaret is but
      better, she will take care of her, and oh how we ought to try&mdash;and I,
      such a naughty wild thing&mdash;if I should hurt the dear little ones by
      carelessness, or by my bad example! Oh! what shall I do, for want of some
      one to keep me in order? If I should vex papa by any of my wrong ways!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They heard the return of the others, and the sisters both sprang up, &ldquo;May
      we bring her to you?&rdquo; said Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, do, my dears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sisters all came down together with the little one, and Flora put her
      down within the arm her father stretched out for her. He gazed into the
      baby face, which, in its expressionless placidity, almost recalled her
      mother&rsquo;s tranquil sweetness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gertrude Margaret,&rdquo; said Flora, and with a look that had more of
      tenderness than grief, he murmured, &ldquo;My Daisy blossom, my little Maggie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Might we?&rdquo; said Ethel, when Flora took her again, &ldquo;might we take her to
      her godmother to see if she would notice her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked as if he wished it; but said, &ldquo;No, I think not, better not rouse
      her,&rdquo; and sighed heavily; then, as they stood round his bed, unwilling to
      go, he added, &ldquo;Girls, we must learn carefulness and thoughtfulness. We
      have no one to take thought for us now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flora pressed the babe in her arms, Ethel&rsquo;s two reluctant tears stood on
      her cheeks, Mary exclaimed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try not to be naughty;&rdquo; and Blanche
      climbed up to kiss him, saying, &ldquo;I will be always good papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daisy&mdash;papa&rsquo;s Daisy&mdash;your vows are made,&rdquo; whispered Ethel,
      gaining sole possession of the babe for a minute. &ldquo;You have promised to be
      good and holy. We have the keeping of you, mamma&rsquo;s precious flower, her
      pearl of truth! Oh, may God guard you to be an unstained jewel, till you
      come back to her again&mdash;and a blooming flower, till you are gathered
      into the wreath that never fades&mdash;my own sweet poor little motherless
      Daisy!&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER V.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Through lawless camp, through ocean wild,
     Her prophet eye pursues her child;
     Scans mournfully her poet&rsquo;s strain,
     Fears for her merchant, loss alike and gain.&rdquo;
                                           LYRA INNOCENTIUM.
</pre>
    <p>
      Dr. May took the management of himself into his own hands, and paid so
      little attention to Mr. Ward&rsquo;s recommendations that his sons and daughters
      were in continual dread of his choosing to do something that might cause
      injurious agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, he did not go further than Margaret&rsquo;s bedroom where he sat hour
      after hour his eyes fixed upon her, as she continued in a state bordering
      on insensibility. He took little notice of anything else, and hardly
      spoke. There were heavy sighs now and then, but Richard and Flora, one or
      other of whom were always watching him, could hardly tell whether to
      ascribe them to the oppression of sorrow or of suffering. Their great fear
      was of his insisting on seeing his wife&rsquo;s face, and it was a great relief
      that he never alluded to her, except once, to desire Richard to bring him
      her ring. Richard silently obeyed, and, without a word, he placed it on
      his little finger. Richard used to read the Psalms to him in the morning,
      before he was up, and Flora would bring little Daisy and lay her by his
      side.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the last moment they dreaded his choosing to attend the funeral, and
      Flora had decided on remaining at home, though trembling at the thought of
      what there might be to go through. They tried to let him hear nothing
      about it, but he seemed to know everything; and when Flora came into
      Margaret&rsquo;s room without her bonnet, he raised his head, and said, &ldquo;I
      thought you were all going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The others are&mdash;but may I not stay with you and her, papa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had rather be alone, my dears. I will take care of her. I should wish
      you all to be there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They decided that his wishes ought to be followed, and that the patients
      must be entrusted to old nurse. Richard told Flora, who looked very pale,
      that she would be glad of it afterwards, and she had his arm to lean upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The grave was in the cloister attached to the minster, a smooth green
      square of turf, marked here and there with small flat lozenges of stone,
      bearing the date and initials of those who lay there, and many of them
      recording former generations of Mays, to whom their descent from the
      headmaster had given a right of burial there. Dr. Hoxton, Mr. Wilmot, and
      the surgeon, were the only friends whom Richard had asked to be with them,
      but the minster was nearly full, for there was a very strong attachment
      and respect for Dr. and Mrs. May throughout the neighbourhood, and every
      one&rsquo;s feelings were strongly excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the midst of life, we are in death&mdash;&rdquo; There was a universal sound
      as of a sort of sob, that Etheldred never disconnected from those words.
      Yet hardly one tear was shed by the young things who stood as close as
      they could round the grave. Harry and Mary did indeed lock their hands
      together tightly, and the shoulders of the former shook as he stood,
      bowing down his head, but the others were still and quiet, in part from
      awe and bewilderment, but partly, too, from a sense that it was against
      her whole nature that there should be clamorous mourning for her. The calm
      still day seemed to tell them the same, the sun beaming softly on the gray
      arches and fresh grass, the sky clear and blue, and the trees that showed
      over the walls bright with autumn colouring, all suitable to the serenity
      of a life unclouded to its last moment. Some of them felt as if it were
      better to be there than in their saddened desolate home.
    </p>
    <p>
      But home they must go, and, before going upstairs, as Flora and Etheldred
      stood a moment or two with Norman, Ethel said in a tone of resolution, and
      of some cheerfulness, &ldquo;Well, we have to begin afresh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Flora, &ldquo;it is a great responsibility. I do trust we may be
      enabled to do as we ought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now Margaret is getting better, she will be our stay,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go to her,&rdquo; and Flora went upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I could be as useful as Flora,&rdquo; said Ethel; but I mean to try, and
      if I can but keep out of mischief, it will be something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is an object for all one does, in trying to be a comfort to papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s no use,&rdquo; said Norman, listlessly. &ldquo;We never can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but, Norman, he won&rsquo;t be always as he is now&mdash;I am sure he cares
      for us enough to be pleased, if we do right and get on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We used to be so happy!&rdquo; said Norman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel hesitated a little, and presently answered, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it can be
      right to lament for our own sakes so much, is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to do so,&rdquo; said Norman, in the same dejected way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose we ought not to feel it either.&rdquo; Norman only shook his head.
      &ldquo;We ought to think of her gain. You can&rsquo;t? Well, I am glad, for no more
      can I. I can&rsquo;t think of her liking for papa and baby and all of us to be
      left to ourselves. But that&rsquo;s not right of me, and of course it all comes
      right where she is; so I always put that out of my head, and think what is
      to come next in doing, and pleasing papa, and learning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s grown horrid,&rdquo; said Norman. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no pleasure in getting on,
      nor in anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you care for papa and all of us being glad, Norman?&rdquo; As Norman
      could not just then say that he did, he would not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish&mdash;&rdquo; said Ethel, disappointed, but cheering up the next minute.
      &ldquo;I do believe it is having nothing to do. You will be better when you get
      back to school on Monday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is worst of all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t like going among the boys again? But that must be done some
      time or other. Or shall I get Richard to speak to Dr. Hoxton to let you
      have another week&rsquo;s leave?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, don&rsquo;t be foolish. It can&rsquo;t be helped.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very sorry, but I think you will be better for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She almost began to fancy herself unfeeling, when she found him so much
      more depressed than she was herself, and unable to feel it a relief to
      know that the time of rest and want of occupation was over. She thought it
      light-minded, though she could not help it, to look forward to the daily
      studies where she might lose her sad thoughts and be as if everything were
      as usual. But suppose she should be to blame, where would now be the
      gentle discipline? Poor Ethel&rsquo;s feelings were not such as to deserve the
      imputation of levity, when this thought came over her; but her buoyant
      mind, always seeking for consolation, recurred to Margaret&rsquo;s improvement,
      and she fixed her hopes on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret was more alive to surrounding objects, and, when roused, she knew
      them all, answered clearly when addressed, had even, more than once,
      spoken of her own accord, and shown solicitude at the sight of her
      father&rsquo;s bandaged, helpless arm, but he soon soothed this away. He was
      more than ever watchful over her, and could scarcely be persuaded to leave
      her for one moment, in his anxiety to be at hand to answer, when first she
      should speak of her mother, a moment apprehended by all the rest, almost
      as much for his sake as for hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      So clear had her perceptions been, and so much more awake did she appear,
      on this evening, that he expected the inquiry to come every moment, and
      lingered in her room; till she asked the hour, and begged him to go to
      bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he bent over her, she looked up in his face, and said softly, &ldquo;Dear
      papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was that in her tone which showed she perceived the truth, and he
      knelt by her side kissing her, but not daring to relax his restraint of
      feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear papa,&rdquo; she said again, &ldquo;I hope I shall soon be better, and be some
      comfort to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My best&mdash;my own&mdash;my comfort,&rdquo; he murmured, all he could say
      without giving way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Baby&mdash;is she well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, thank Heaven, she has not suffered at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard her this morning, I must see her to-morrow. But don&rsquo;t stay, dear,
      dear papa, it is late, and I am sure you are not at all well. Your arm&mdash;is
      it very much hurt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is nothing you need think about, my dear. I am much better than I
      could have imagined possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have been nursing me all the time! Papa, you must let me take
      care of you now. Do pray go to bed at once, and get up late. Nurse will
      take good care of me. Good-night, dear papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Dr. May had left her, and tried to tell Richard how it had been, the
      tears cut him short, and had their free course; but there was much of
      thankfulness, for it might be looked on as the restoration of his
      daughter; the worst was over, and the next day he was able to think of
      other things, had more attention to spare for the rest, and when the
      surgeon came, took some professional interest in the condition of his own
      arm, inquired after his patients, and even talked of visiting them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, Margaret sent for her eldest brother, begging him to tell
      her the whole, and it was heard as calmly and firmly as it was told. Her
      bodily state lulled her mind; and besides it was not new; she had observed
      much while her faculties were still too much benumbed for her to
      understand all, or to express her feelings. Her thoughts seemed chiefly
      occupied with her father. She made Richard explain to her the injury he
      had suffered, and begged to know whether his constant attendance on her
      could do him harm. She was much rejoiced when her brother assured her that
      nothing could be better for him, and she began to say, with a smile, that
      very likely her being hurt had been fortunate. She asked who had taken
      care of him before Richard&rsquo;s arrival, and was pleased to hear that it was
      Mr. Ernescliffe. A visit from the little Gertrude Margaret was happily
      accomplished, and, on the whole, the day was most satisfactory&mdash;she
      herself declaring that she could not see that there was anything the
      matter with her, except that she felt lazy, and did not seem able to move.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the next Sunday morning dawned with more cheerfulness. Dr. May came
      downstairs for the first time, in order to go to church with his whole
      flock, except the two Margarets. He looked very wan and shattered, but
      they clustered gladly round him, when he once more stood among them,
      little Blanche securing his hand, and nodding triumphantly to Mr.
      Ernescliffe, as much as to say, &ldquo;Now I have him, I don&rsquo;t want you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norman alone was missing; but he was in his place at church among the
      boys. Again, in returning, he slipped out of the party, and was at home
      the first, and when this recurred in the afternoon Ethel began to
      understand his motive. The High Street led past the spot where the
      accident had taken place, though neither she nor any of the others knew
      exactly where it was, except Norman, on whose mind the scene was branded
      indelibly; she guessed that it was to avoid it that he went along what was
      called Randall&rsquo;s Alley, his usual short cut to school.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sunday brought back to the children that there was no one to hear
      their hymns; but Richard was a great comfort, watching over the little
      ones more like a sister than a brother. Ethel was ashamed of herself when
      she saw him taking thought for them, tying Blanche&rsquo;s bonnet, putting
      Aubrey&rsquo;s gloves on, teaching them to put away their Sunday toys, as if he
      meant them to be as neat and precise as himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. May did not encounter the family dinner, nor attempt a second going to
      church; but Blanche was very glorious as she led him down to drink tea,
      and, before going up again, he had a conversation with Alan Ernescliffe,
      who felt himself obliged to leave Stoneborough early on the morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can endure better to go now,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and I shall hear of you often;
      Hector will let me know, and Richard has promised to write.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, you must let us often have a line. I should guess you were a
      letter-writing man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have hitherto had too few friends who cared to hear of me to write
      much, but the pleasure of knowing that any interest is taken in me here&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;mind that a letter will always be welcome, and
      when you are coming southwards, here are your old quarters. We cannot lose
      sight of you anyway, especially&rdquo;&mdash;and his voice quivered&mdash;&ldquo;after
      the help you gave my poor boys and girls in their distress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be the utmost satisfaction to think I had been of the smallest
      use,&rdquo; said Alan, hiding much under these commonplace words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More than I know,&rdquo; said Dr. May; &ldquo;too much to speak of. Well, we shall
      see you again, though it is a changed place, and you must come and see
      your god-daughter&mdash;poor child&mdash;may she only be brought up as her
      sisters were! They will do their best, poor things, and so must I, but it
      is sad work!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both were too much overcome for words, but the doctor was the first to
      continue, as he took off his dimmed spectacles. He seemed to wish to
      excuse himself for giving way; saying, with a look that would fain have
      been a smile, &ldquo;The world has run so light and easy with me hitherto, that
      you see I don&rsquo;t know how to bear with trouble. All thinking and managing
      fell to my Maggie&rsquo;s share, and I had as little care on my hands as one of
      my own boys&mdash;poor fellows. I don&rsquo;t know how it is to turn out, but of
      all the men on earth to be left with eleven children, I should choose
      myself as the worst.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alan tried to say somewhat of &ldquo;Confidence&mdash;affection&mdash;daughters,&rdquo;
       and broke down, but it did as well as if it had been connected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;they are good children every one of them.
      There&rsquo;s much to be thankful for, if one could only pluck up heart to feel
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you are convinced that Marga&mdash;that Miss May is recovering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has made a great advance today. The head is right, at least,&rdquo; but the
      doctor looked anxious and spoke low as he said, &ldquo;I am not satisfied about
      her yet. That want of power over the limbs, is more than the mere shock
      and debility, as it seems to me, though Ward thinks otherwise, and I trust
      he is right, but I cannot tell yet as to the spine. If this should not
      soon mend I shall have Fleet to see her. He was a fellow-student of mine
      very clever, and I have more faith in him than in any one else in that
      line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By all means&mdash;Yes,&rdquo; said Alan, excessively shocked. &ldquo;But you will
      let me know how she goes on&mdash;Richard will be so kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will not fail,&rdquo; said Dr May more and more touched at the sight of the
      young sailor struggling in vain to restrain his emotion, &ldquo;you shall hear.
      I&rsquo;ll write myself as soon as I can use my hand, but I hope she may be all
      right long before that is likely to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your kindness&mdash;&rdquo; Alan attempted to say, but began again. &ldquo;Feeling as
      I must&mdash;&rdquo; then interrupting himself. &ldquo;I beg your pardon, &lsquo;tis no fit
      time, nor fit&mdash;But you&rsquo;ll let me hear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I will,&rdquo; said Dr May, and as Alan hastily left the room, he
      continued, half aloud, to himself, &ldquo;Poor boy! poor fellow. I see. No
      wonder! Heaven grant I have not been the breaking of their two young
      hearts, as well as my own! Maggie looked doubtful&mdash;as much as she
      ever did when my mind was set on a thing, when I spoke of bringing him
      here. But after all, she liked him as much as the rest of us did&mdash;she
      could not wish it otherwise&mdash;he is one of a thousand, and worthy of
      our Margaret. That he is! and Maggie thinks so. If he gets on in his
      profession, why then we shall see&mdash;&rdquo; but the sigh of anguish of mind
      here showed that the wound had but been forgotten for one moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw! What am I running on to? I&rsquo;m all astray for want of her! My poor
      girl&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr Ernescliffe set out before sunrise. The boys were up to wish him
      good-bye, and so were Etheldred and Mary, and some one else, for while the
      shaking of hands was going on in the hall there was a call, &ldquo;Mr
      Ernthcliffe,&rdquo; and over the balusters peeped a little rough curly head, a
      face glowing with carnation deepened by sleep, and a round, plump, bare
      arm and shoulder, and down at Alan&rsquo;s feet there fell a construction of
      white and pink paper, while a voice lisped out, &ldquo;Mr Ernthcliffe, there&rsquo;s a
      white rothe for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An indignant &ldquo;Miss Blanche!&rdquo; was heard behind and there was no certainty
      that any thanks reached the poor little heroine, who was evidently borne
      off summarily to the nursery, while Ethel gave way to a paroxysm of
      suppressed laughter, joined in, more or less, by all the rest, and thus
      Alan, promising faithfully to preserve the precious token, left Dr May&rsquo;s
      door, not in so much outward sorrow as he had expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even their father laughed at the romance of the white &ldquo;rothe,&rdquo; and
      declared Blanche was a dangerous young lady; but the story was less
      successful with Miss Winter, who gravely said it was no wonder since
      Blanche&rsquo;s elder sister had been setting her the example of forwardness in
      coming down in this way after Mr. Ernescliffe. Ethel was very angry, and
      was only prevented from vindicating herself by remembering there was no
      peacemaker now, and that she had resolved only to think of Miss Winter&rsquo;s
      late kindness, and bear with her tiresome ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      Etheldred thought herself too sorrowful to be liable to her usual faults
      which would seem so much worse now; but she found herself more irritable
      than usual, and doubly heedless, because her mind was preoccupied. She
      hated herself, and suffered more from sorrow than even at the first
      moment, for now she felt what it was to have no one to tame her, no eye
      over her; she found herself going a tort et a travers all the morning, and
      with no one to set her right. Since it was so the first day, what would
      follow?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary was on the contrary so far subdued, as to be exemplary in goodness
      and diligence, and Blanche was always steady. Flora was too busy to think
      of the school-room, for the whole house was on her hands, besides the
      charge of Margaret, while Dr. May went to the hospital, and to sundry
      patients, and they thought he seemed the better for the occupation, as
      well as gratified and affected by the sympathy he everywhere met with from
      high and low.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys were at school, unseen except when at the dinner play-hour Norman
      ran home to ask after his father and sister; but the most trying time was
      at eight in the evening, when they came home. That was wont to be the
      merriest part of the whole day, the whole family collected, papa at
      leisure and ready for talk or for play, mamma smiling over her
      work-basket, the sisters full of chatter, the brothers full of fun, all
      the tidings of the day discussed, and nothing unwelcome but bedtime. How
      different now! The doctor was with Margaret, and though Richard tried to
      say something cheerful as his brothers entered, there was no response, and
      they sat down on the opposite sides of the fire, forlorn and silent, till
      Richard, who was printing some letters on card-board to supply the gaps in
      Aubrey&rsquo;s ivory Alphabet, called Harry to help him; but Ethel, as she sat
      at work, could only look at Norman, and wish she could devise anything
      likely to gratify him.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a time Flora came down, and laying some sheets of closely written
      note-paper before her sister, said, &ldquo;Here is dear mamma&rsquo;s unfinished
      letter to Aunt Flora. Papa says we elder ones are to read it. It is a
      description of us all, and very much indeed we ought to learn from it. I
      shall keep a copy of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flora took up her work, and began to consult with Richard, while Ethel
      moved to Norman&rsquo;s side, and kneeling so as to lean against his shoulder,
      as he sat on a low cushion, they read their mother&rsquo;s last letter by the
      fire-light, with indescribable feelings, as they went through the subjects
      that had lately occupied them, related by her who would never be among
      them again. After much of this kind, for her letters to Mrs. Arnott were
      almost journals, came,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say it is long since you had a portrait gallery of the chicken
      daisies, and if I do not write in these leisure days, you will hardly get
      it after I am in the midst of business again. The new Daisy is like
      Margaret at the same age&mdash;may she continue like her! Pretty creature,
      she can hardly be more charming than at present. Aubrey, the moon-faced,
      is far from reconciled to his disposition from babyhood; he is a sober,
      solemn gentleman, backward in talking, and with such a will of his own, as
      will want much watching; very different from Blanche, who is Flora over
      again, perhaps prettier and more fairy-like, unless this is only one&rsquo;s
      admiration for the buds of the present season. None of them has ever been
      so winning as this little maid, who even attracts Dr. Hoxton himself, and
      obtains sugar-plums and kisses. &lsquo;Rather she than I,&rsquo; says Harry, but
      notice is notice to the white Mayflower, and there is my anxiety&mdash;I
      am afraid it is not wholesome to be too engaging ever to get a rebuff. I
      hope having a younger sister, and outgrowing baby charms may be salutary.
      Flora soon left off thinking about her beauty, and the fit of vanity does
      less harm at five than fifteen. My poor Tom has not such a happy life as
      Blanche, he is often in trouble at lessons, and bullied by Harry at play,
      in spite of his champion, Mary; and yet I cannot interfere, for it is good
      for him to have all this preparatory teasing before he goes into school.
      He has good abilities, but not much perseverance or energy, and I must
      take the teaching of him into my own hands till his school-days begin, in
      hopes of instilling them. The girlishness and timidity will be knocked out
      of him by the boys, I suppose; Harry is too kind and generous to do more
      than tease him moderately, and Norman will see that it does not go too
      far. It is a common saying that Tom and Mary made a mistake, that he is
      the girl, and she the boy, for she is a rough, merry creature, the
      noisiest in the house, always skirmishing with Harry in defence of Tom,
      and yet devoted to him, and wanting to do everything he does. Those two,
      Harry and Mary, are exactly alike, except for Harry&rsquo;s curly mane of
      lion-coloured wig. The yellow-haired laddie, is papa&rsquo;s name for Harry,
      which he does not mind from him, though furious if the girls attempt to
      call him so. Harry is the thorough boy of the family, all spirit,
      recklessness, and mischief, but so true, and kind, and noble-hearted, that
      one loves him the better after every freely confessed scrape. I cannot
      tell you how grateful I am to my boy for his perfect confidence, the thing
      that chiefly lessens my anxiety for him in his half-school, half-home
      life, which does not seem to me to work quite well with him. There are two
      sons of Mrs. Anderson&rsquo;s at the school, who are more his friends than I
      like, and he is too easily led by the desire not to be outdone, and to
      show that he fears nothing. Lately, our sailor-guest has inspired him with
      a vehement wish to go to sea; I wish it was not necessary that the
      decision should be made so early in life, for this fault is just what
      would make us most fear to send him into the world very young, though in
      some ways it might not do amiss for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much for the younger bairns, whom you never beheld, dear Flora. The
      three whom you left, when people used to waste pity on me for their being
      all babies together, now look as if any pair of them were twins, for
      Norman is the tallest, almost outgrowing his strength, and Ethel&rsquo;s sharp
      face, so like her papa&rsquo;s, makes her look older than Flora. Norman and
      Ethel do indeed take after their papa, more than any of the others, and
      are much alike. There is the same brilliant cleverness, the same strong
      feeling, not easy of demonstration, though impetuous in action; but poor
      Ethel&rsquo;s old foibles, her harum-scarum nature, quick temper, uncouth
      manners, and heedlessness of all but one absorbing object, have kept her
      back, and caused her much discomfort; yet I sometimes think these manifest
      defects have occasioned a discipline that is the best thing for the
      character in the end. They are faults that show themselves, and which one
      can tell how to deal with, and I have full confidence that she has the
      principle within her that will conquer them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If&mdash;&rdquo; mournfully sighed Ethel; but her brother pointed on further.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My great hope is her entire indifference to praise&mdash;not approval,
      but praise. If she has not come up to her own standard, she works on, not
      always with good temper, but perseveringly, and entirely, unheeding of
      commendation till she has satisfied herself, only thinking it stupid not
      to see the faults. It is this independence of praise that I want to see in
      her brother and sister. They justly earn it, and are rightly pleased with
      it; but I cannot feel sure whether they do not depend on it too much.
      Norman lives, like all school-boys, a life of emulation, and has never met
      with anything but success. I do believe Dr. Hoxton and Mr. Wilmot are as
      proud of him as we are; and he has never shown any tendency to conceit,
      but I am afraid he has the love of being foremost, and pride in his
      superiority, caring for what he is, compared with others, rather than what
      he is himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Norman; &ldquo;I have done so, but that&rsquo;s over. I see what it is
      worth. I&rsquo;d give all the quam optimes I ever got in my life to be the help
      Richard is to papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would if you were his age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I, I&rsquo;m not the sort. I&rsquo;m not like her. But are we to go on about the
      elders?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes, don&rsquo;t let us miss a word. There can&rsquo;t be anything but praise of
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your sweet goddaughter. I almost feel as if I had spoken in disparagement
      of her, but I meant no such thing, dear girl. It would be hard to find a
      fault in her, since the childish love of admiration was subdued. She is so
      solid and steady, as to be very valuable with the younger ones, and is
      fast growing so lovely, that I wish you could behold her. I do not see any
      vanity, but there lies my dread, not of beauty&mdash;vanity, but that she
      will find temptation in the being everywhere liked and sought after. As to
      Margaret, my precious companion and friend, you have heard enough of her
      to know her, and, as to telling you what she is like, I could as soon set
      about describing her papa. When I thought of not being spared to them this
      time, it was happiness indeed to think of her at their head, fit to be his
      companion, with so much of his own talent as to be more up to conversation
      with him, than he could ever have found his stupid old Maggie. It was
      rather a trial of her discretion to have Mr. Ernescliffe here while I was
      upstairs, and very well she seems to have come out of it. Poor Richard&rsquo;s
      last disappointment is still our chief trouble. He has been working hard
      with a tutor all through the vacation, and has not even come home to see
      his new sister, on his way to Oxford. He had made a resolution that he
      would not come to us till he had passed, and his father thought it best
      that it should be kept. I hope he will succeed next time, but his
      nervousness renders it still more doubtful. With him it is the very
      reverse of Norman. He suffers too much for want of commendation, and I
      cannot wonder at it, when I see how much each failure vexes his father,
      and Richard little knows how precious is our perfect confidence in him,
      how much more valuable than any honours he could earn. You would be amused
      to see how little he is altered from the pretty little fair fellow, that
      you used to say was so like my old portrait, even the wavy rings of light
      glossy hair sit on his forehead, just as you liked to twist them; and his
      small trim figure is a fine contrast to Norman&rsquo;s long legs and arms, which&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There the letter broke off, the playful affection of the last words making
      it almost more painful to think that the fond hand would never finish the
      sentence.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     A drooping daisy changed into a cup,
     In which her bright-eyed beauty is shut up.
                                          WORDSWORTH.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So there you are up for the day&mdash;really you look very comfortable,&rdquo;
       said Ethel, coming into the room where Margaret lay on her bed,
      half-raised by pillows, supported by a wooden frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, is not it a charming contrivance of Richard&rsquo;s? It quite gives me the
      use of my hands,&rdquo; said Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he is doing something else for you,&rdquo; said Ethel; &ldquo;I heard him
      carpentering at six o&rsquo;clock this morning, but I suppose it is to be a
      secret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t you admire her night-cap?&rdquo; said Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it anything different?&rdquo; said Ethel, peering closer. &ldquo;Oh, I see&mdash;so
      she has a fine day night-cap. Is that your taste, Flora?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Partly,&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;and partly my own. I put in all these little
      white puffs, and I hope you think they do me credit. Wasn&rsquo;t it grand of
      me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She only despises you for them,&rdquo; said Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very glad you could,&rdquo; said Ethel, gravely; &ldquo;but do you know? it is
      rather like that horrid old lady in some book, who had a paralytic stroke,
      and the first thing she did that showed she had come to her senses was to
      write, &lsquo;Rose-coloured curtains for the doctors.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it was for the doctor,&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;and it had its effect. He
      told me I looked much better when he found me trying it on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And did you really have the looking-glass and try it on?&rdquo; cried Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, really,&rdquo; said Flora. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think one may as well be fit to be
      seen if one is ill? It is no use to depress one&rsquo;s friends by being more
      forlorn and disconsolate than one can help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;not disconsolate,&rdquo; said Ethel; &ldquo;but the white puffiness&mdash;and
      the hemming&mdash;and the glass!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Ethel can&rsquo;t get over it,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;But, Ethel, do you think
      there is nothing disconsolate in untidiness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could be tidy without the little puffs! Your first bit of work too!
      Don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m tiresome. If they were an amusement to you, I am sure I am
      very glad of them, but I can&rsquo;t see the sense of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor little things!&rdquo; said Margaret laughing. &ldquo;It is only my foible for
      making a thing look nice. And, Ethel,&rdquo; she added, drawing her down close
      over her, &ldquo;I did not think the trouble wasted, if seeing me look fresher
      cheered up dear papa a moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I spoke to papa about nurse&rsquo;s proposal,&rdquo; said Margaret presently to
      Flora, &ldquo;and he quite agrees to it. Indeed it is impossible that Anne
      should attend properly to all the children while nurse is so much engaged
      with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; said Flora; &ldquo;and it does not answer to bring Aubrey into the
      school-room. It only makes Mary and Blanche idle, and Miss Winter does not
      like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the question is, who shall it be? Nurse has no one in view, and only
      protests against &lsquo;one of the girls out of the school here.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a great pity,&rdquo; said Flora. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think we could make her take
      to Jane White, she is so very nice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought of her, but it will never answer if we displease nurse.
      Besides, I remember at the time Anne came, dear mamma thought there was
      danger of a girl&rsquo;s having too many acquaintances, especially taking the
      children out walking. We cannot always be sure of sending her out with
      Anne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember&mdash;&rdquo; said Ethel, there stopping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said both sisters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you recollect, Flora, that girl whose father was in the hospital&mdash;that
      girl at Cocksmoor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said Flora. &ldquo;She was a very nice girl; I wonder whether nurse
      would approve of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How old?&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;Fourteen, and tall. Such a clean cottage!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girls went on, and Margaret began to like the idea very much, and
      consider whether the girl could be brought for inspection, before nurse
      was prejudiced by hearing of her Cocksmoor extraction. At that moment
      Richard knocked at the door, and entered with Tom, helping him to bring a
      small short-legged table, such as could stand on the bed at the right
      height for Margaret&rsquo;s meals or employments.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were great exclamations of satisfaction, and gratitude; &ldquo;it was the
      very thing wanted, only how could he have contrived it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you recognise it?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I see; it is the old drawing-desk that no one used. And you have put
      legs to it&mdash;how famous! You are the best contriver, Richard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then see, you can raise it up for reading or writing; here&rsquo;s a corner for
      your ink to stand flat; and there it is down for your dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charming, you have made it go so easily, when it used to be so stiff.
      There&mdash;give me my work-basket, please, Ethel; I mean to make some
      more white puffs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter now, Ethel?&rdquo; said Flora; &ldquo;you look as if you did not
      approve of the table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was only thinking it was as if she was settling herself to lie in bed
      for a very long time,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; said Richard; &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t see why she should not be as
      comfortable as she can, while she is there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure I hope you will never be ill, Ethel,&rdquo; said Flora. &ldquo;You would be
      horrid to nurse!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will know how to be grateful when she is,&rdquo; said Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Richard,&rdquo; exclaimed Ethel, &ldquo;this is hospital-meeting day, so you
      won&rsquo;t be wanted to drive papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I am at your service; do you want a walk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So it was determined that Richard and Ethel should walk together to
      Cocksmoor.
    </p>
    <p>
      No two people could be much more unlike than Richard and Etheldred May;
      but they were very fond of each other. Richard was sometimes seriously
      annoyed by Ethel&rsquo;s heedlessness, and did not always understand her
      sublimities, but he had a great deal of admiration for one who partook so
      much of his father&rsquo;s nature; and Ethel had a due respect for her eldest
      brother, gratitude and strong affection for many kindnesses, a reverence
      for his sterling goodness, and his exemption from her own besetting
      failings, only a little damped by compassionate wonder at his deficiency
      in talent, and by her vexation at not being always comprehended.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went by the road, for the plantation gate was far too serious an
      undertaking for any one not in the highest spirits for enterprise. On the
      way there was a good deal of that desultory talk, very sociable and
      interesting, that is apt to prevail between two people, who would never
      have chosen each other for companions, if they were not of the same
      family, but who are nevertheless very affectionate and companionable.
      Ethel was anxious to hear what her brother thought of papa&rsquo;s spirits, and
      whether he talked in their drives.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; said Richard. &ldquo;It is just as it happens. Now and then he goes
      on just like himself, and then at other times he will not speak for three
      or four miles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he sighs?&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;Those sighs are so very sad, and long, and
      deep! They seem to have whole volumes in them, as if there was such a
      weight on him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some people say he is not as much altered as they expected,&rdquo; said
      Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! do they? Well! I can&rsquo;t fancy any one feeling it more. He can&rsquo;t leave
      off his old self, of course, but&mdash;&rdquo; Ethel stopped short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Margaret is a great comfort to him,&rdquo; said Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That she is. She thinks of him all day long, and I don&rsquo;t think either of
      them is ever so happy as in the evening, when he sits with her. They talk
      about mamma then&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was just what Richard could not do, and he made some observation to
      change the subject, but Ethel returned to it, so far as to beg to know how
      the arm was going on, for she did not like to say anything about it to
      papa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be a long business, I am afraid,&rdquo; said Richard. &ldquo;Indeed, he said
      the other day, he thought he should never have the free use of the elbow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you think it is very painful? I saw the other day, when Aubrey was
      sitting on his knee and fidgeting, he shrank whenever he even came towards
      it, and yet it seemed as if he could not bear to put him down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes it is excessively tender, and sometimes gets very bad at night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Ethel; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a line&mdash;here&mdash;round his eyes, that
      there never used to be, and when it deepens, I am sure he is in pain, or
      has been kept awake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very odd, Ethel; how do you see things in people&rsquo;s faces, when
      you miss so much at just the same distance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I look after what I care about,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;One sees more with one&rsquo;s
      mind than one&rsquo;s eyes. The best sight is inside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But do you always see the truth?&rdquo; said Richard gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite enough. What is less common than the ordinary world?&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard shook his head, not quite satisfied, but not sure enough that he
      entered into her meaning to question it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder you don&rsquo;t wear spectacles,&rdquo; was the result of his meditation,
      and it made her laugh by being so inapposite to her own reflections: but
      the laugh ended in a melancholy look. &ldquo;Dear mamma did not like me to use
      them,&rdquo; she said, in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus they talked till they arrived at Cocksmoor, where poor Mrs. Taylor,
      inspirited by better reports of her husband and the hopes for her
      daughter, was like another woman. Richard was very careful not to raise
      false expectations, saying it all depended on Miss May and nurse, and what
      they thought of her strength and steadiness, but these cautions did not
      seem capable of damping the hopes of the smooth-haired Lucy, who stood
      smiling and curtseying. The twins were grown and improved, and Ethel
      supposed they would be brought to church on the next christening Sunday,
      but their mother looked helpless and hopeless about getting them so far,
      and how was she to get gossips? Ethel began to grow very indignant, but
      she was always shy of finding fault with poor people to their faces when
      she would not have done so to persons in her own station, and so she was
      silent, while Richard hoped they would be able to manage, and said it
      would be better not to wait another month for still worse weather and
      shorter days.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they were coming out of the house, a big, rough-looking, uncivilised
      boy came up before them, and called out, &ldquo;I say&mdash;ben&rsquo;t you the young
      doctor up at Stoneborough?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Dr. May&rsquo;s son,&rdquo; said Richard; while Ethel, startled, clung to his
      arm, in dread of some rudeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Granny&rsquo;s bad,&rdquo; said the boy; proceeding without further explanation to
      lead the way to another hovel, though Richard tried to explain that the
      knowledge of medicine was not in his case hereditary. A poor old woman sat
      groaning over the fire, and two children crouched, half-clothed, on the
      bare floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard&rsquo;s gentle voice and kind manner drew forth some wonderful
      descriptions&mdash;&ldquo;her head was all of a goggle, her legs all of a fur,
      she felt as if some one was cutting right through her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Richard kindly, &ldquo;I am no doctor myself, but I&rsquo;ll ask my
      father about you, and perhaps he can give you an order for the hospital.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, thank ye, sir; I can&rsquo;t go to the hospital, I can&rsquo;t leave these
      poor children; they&rsquo;ve no father nor mother, sir, and no one to do for
      them but me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you live on, then?&rdquo; said Richard, looking round the desolate hut.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On Sam&rsquo;s wages, sir; that&rsquo;s that boy. He is a good boy to me, sir, and
      his little sisters; he brings it, all he gets, home to me, rig&rsquo;lar, but
      &lsquo;tis but six shillings a week, and they makes &lsquo;em take half of it out in
      goods and beer, which is a bad thing for a boy like him, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How old are you, Sam?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam scratched his head, and answered nothing. His grandmother knew he was
      the age of her black bonnet, and as he looked about fifteen, Ethel
      honoured him and the bonnet accordingly, while Richard said he must be
      very glad to be able to maintain them all, at his age, and, promising to
      try to bring his father that way, since prescribing at second hand for
      such curious symptoms was more than could be expected, he took his leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A wretched place,&rdquo; said Richard, looking round. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what help
      there is for the people. There&rsquo;s no one to do any thing for them, and it
      is of no use to tell them to come to church when it it so far off, and
      there is so little room for them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is miserable,&rdquo; said Ethel; and all her thoughts during her last walk
      thither began to rush over her again, not effaced, but rather burned in,
      by all that had subsequently happened. She had said it should be her aim
      and effort to make Cocksmoor a Christian place. Such a resolve must not
      pass away lightly; she knew it must be acted on, but how? What would her
      present means&mdash;one sovereign&mdash;effect? Her fancies, rich and
      rare, had nearly been forgotten of late, but she might make them of use in
      time&mdash;in time, and here were hives of children growing up in
      heathenism. Suddenly an idea struck her&mdash;Richard, when at home, was a
      very diligent teacher in the Sunday-school at Stoneborough, though it was
      a thankless task, and he was the only gentleman so engaged, except the two
      clergymen&mdash;the other male teachers being a formal, grave, little
      baker, and one or two monitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what. Suppose we were to get up a
      Sunday-school at Cocksmoor. We could get a room, and walk there every
      Sunday afternoon, and go to church in the evening instead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was so confounded by the suddenness of the project, that he did not
      answer, till she had time for several exclamations and &ldquo;Well, Richard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot tell,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Going to church in the evening would interfere
      with tea-time&mdash;put out all the house&mdash;make the evening
      uncomfortable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The evenings are horrid now, especially Sundays,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But missing two more would make them worse for the others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa is always with Margaret,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;We are of no use to him.
      Besides these poor children&mdash;are not they of more importance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, then, what is to become of Stoneborough school?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate it,&rdquo; exclaimed Ethel; then seeing Richard shocked, and finding she
      had spoken more vehemently than she intended&mdash;&ldquo;It is not as bad for
      you among the boys, but, while that committee goes on it is not the least
      use to try to teach the girls right. Oh! the fusses about the books, and
      one&rsquo;s way of teaching! And fancy how Mrs Ledwich used us. You know I went
      again last Sunday, for the first time, and there I found that class of
      Margaret&rsquo;s, that she had just managed to get into some degree of nice
      order, taken so much pains with, taught so well. She had been telling me
      what to hear them&mdash;there it is given away to Fanny Anderson, who is
      no more fit to teach than that stick, and all Margaret&rsquo;s work will be
      undone. No notice to us&mdash;not even the civility to wait and see when
      she gets better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we left them now for Cocksmoor, would it not look as it we were
      affronted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel was slightly taken aback, but only said, &ldquo;Papa would be very angry
      if he knew it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad you did not tell him,&rdquo; said Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought it would only tease him,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;and that he might call
      it a petty female squabble; and when Margaret is well, it will come right,
      if Fanny Anderson has not spoiled the girls in the meantime. It is all
      Mrs. Ledwich&rsquo;s doing. How I did hate it when every one came up and shook
      hands with me, and asked after Margaret and papa, only just out of
      curiosity!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, hush, Ethel, what&rsquo;s the use of thinking such things?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A silence,&mdash;then she exclaimed, &ldquo;But, indeed, Richard, you don&rsquo;t
      fancy that I want to teach at Cocksmoor, because it is disagreeable at
      Stoneborough?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rendering of full justice conveyed in his tone so opened Ethel&rsquo;s heart
      that she went on eagerly:&mdash;&ldquo;The history of it is this. Last time we
      walked here, that day, I said, and I meant it, that I would never put it
      out of my head; I would go on doing and striving, and trying, till this
      place was properly cared for, and has a church and a clergyman. I believe
      it was a vow, Richard, I do believe it was,&mdash;and if one makes one,
      one must keep it. There it is. So, I can&rsquo;t give money, I have but one
      pound in the world, but I have time, and I would make that useful, if you
      would help me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how,&rdquo; was the answer, and there was a fragment of a smile on
      Richard&rsquo;s face, as if it struck him as a wild scheme, that Ethel should
      undertake, single handed, to evangelise Cocksmoor.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was such a damper as to be most mortifying to an enthusiastic girl, and
      she drew into herself in a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked home in silence, and when Richard warned her that she was not
      keeping her dress out of the dirt, it sounded like a sarcasm on her
      projects, and, with a slightly pettish manner, she raised the unfortunate
      skirt, its crape trimmings greatly bespattered with ruddy mud. Then
      recollecting how mamma would have shaken her head at that very thing, she
      regretted the temper she had betrayed, and in a larmoyante voice, sighed,
      &ldquo;I wish I could pick my way better. Some people have the gift, you have
      hardly a splash, and I&rsquo;m up to the ankles in mud.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is only taking care,&rdquo; said Richard; &ldquo;besides your frock is so long,
      and full. Can&rsquo;t you tuck it up and pin it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My pins always come out,&rdquo; said Ethel, disconsolately, crumpling the black
      folds into one hand, while she hunted for a pin with the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No wonder, if you stick them in that way,&rdquo; said Richard. &ldquo;Oh! you&rsquo;ll tear
      that crape. Here, let me help you. Don&rsquo;t you see, make it go in and out,
      that way; give it something to pull against.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel laughed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the third thing you have taught me&mdash;to thread
      a needle, tie a bow, and stick in a pin! I never could learn those things
      of any one else; they show, but don&rsquo;t explain the theory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They met Dr. May at the entrance of the town, very tired, and saying he
      had been a long tramp, all over the place, and Mrs. Hoxton had been boring
      him with her fancies. As he took Richard&rsquo;s arm he gave the long heavy sigh
      that always fell so painfully on Ethel&rsquo;s ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear, dear, dear papa!&rdquo; thought she, &ldquo;my work must also be to do all I
      can to comfort him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her reflections were broken off. Dr. May exclaimed, &ldquo;Ethel, don&rsquo;t make
      such a figure of yourself. Those muddy ankles and petticoats are not fit
      to be seen&mdash;there, now you are sweeping the pavement. Have you no
      medium? One would think you had never worn a gown in your life before!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor Ethel stepped on before with mud-encrusted heels, and her father
      speaking sharply in the weariness and soreness of his heart; her
      draggle-tailed petticoats weighing down at once her missionary projects at
      Cocksmoor, and her tender visions of comforting her widowed father; her
      heart was full to overflowing, and where was the mother to hear her
      troubles?
    </p>
    <p>
      She opened the hall door, and would have rushed upstairs, but nurse
      happened to be crossing the hall. &ldquo;Miss Ethel! Miss Ethel, you aren&rsquo;t
      going up with them boots on! I do declare you are just like one of the
      boys. And your frock!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel sat submissively down on the lowest step, and pulled off her boots.
      As she did so, her father and brother came in&mdash;the former desiring
      Richard to come with him to the study, and write a note for him. She hoped
      that thus she might have Margaret to herself, and hurried into her room.
      Margaret was alone, maids and children at tea, and Flora dressing. The
      room was in twilight, with the red gleam of the fire playing cheerfully
      over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Ethel, have you had a pleasant walk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;no&mdash;Oh, Margaret!&rdquo; and throwing herself across the bottom
      of the bed, she burst into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ethel, dear, what is the matter? Papa&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;no&mdash;only I draggled my frock, and Richard threw cold water.
      And I am good for nothing! Oh! if mamma was but here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Darling Ethel, dear Ethel, I wish I could comfort you. Come a little
      nearer to me, I can&rsquo;t reach you! Dear Ethel, what has gone wrong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;No&mdash;I&rsquo;m too dirty to come on your white
      bed; I forgot, you won&rsquo;t like it,&rdquo; added she, in an injured tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are wet, you are cold, you are tired,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;Stay here and
      dress, don&rsquo;t go up in the cold. There, sit by the fire pull off your frock
      and stockings, and we will send for the others. Let me see you look
      comfortable&mdash;there. Now tell me who threw cold water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was figurative cold water,&rdquo; said Ethel, smiling for a moment. &ldquo;I was
      only silly enough to tell Richard my plan, and it&rsquo;s horrid to talk to a
      person who only thinks one high-flying and nonsensical&mdash;and then came
      the dirt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what was the scheme, Ethel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cocksmoor,&rdquo; said Ethel, proceeding to unfold it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish we could,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;It would be an excellent thing. But how
      did Richard vex you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;only he thought it would not do. Perhaps he
      said right, but it was coldly, and he smiled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is too sober-minded for our flights,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;I know the
      feeling of it, Ethel dear; but you know if he did see that some of your
      plans might not answer, it is no reason you should not try to do something
      at once. You have not told me about the girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel proceeded to tell the history. &ldquo;There!&rdquo; said Margaret cheerfully,
      &ldquo;there are two ways of helping Cocksmoor already. Could you not make some
      clothes for the two grandchildren? I could help you a little, and then, if
      they were well clothed, you might get them to come to the Sunday-school.
      And as to the twins, I wonder what the hire of a cart would be to bring
      the christening party? It is just what Richard could manage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ethel; &ldquo;but those are only little isolated individual things!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But one must make a beginning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, Margaret, you think it was a real vow? You don&rsquo;t think it silly of
      me?&rdquo; said Ethel wistfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ethel, dear, I don&rsquo;t think dear mamma would say we ought to make vows,
      except what the church decrees for us. I don&rsquo;t think she would like the
      notion of your considering yourself pledged; but I do think, that, after
      all you have said and felt about Cocksmoor, and being led there on that
      day, it does seem as if we might be intended to make it our especial
      charge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Margaret, I am glad you say so. You always understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you know we are so young, that now we have not her to judge for us,
      we must only do little things that we are quite sure of, or we shall get
      wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the way great things were done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Ethel; I think great things can&rsquo;t be good unless they stand
      on a sure foundation of little ones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I believe Richard was right, and it would not do to begin on
      Sunday, but he was so tame; and then my frock, and the horrid deficiency
      in those little neatnesses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps that is good for you in one way; you might get very high-flying
      if you had not the discipline of those little tiresome things, correcting
      them will help you, and keep your high things from being all romance. I
      know dear mamma used to say so; that the trying to conquer them was a help
      to you. Oh, here&rsquo;s Mary! Mary, will you get Ethel&rsquo;s dressing things? She
      has come home wet-footed and cold, and has been warming herself by my
      fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary was happy to help, and Ethel was dressed and cheered by the time Dr.
      May came in, for a hurried visit and report of his doings; Flora followed
      on her way from her room. Then all went to tea, leaving Margaret to have a
      visit from the little ones under charge of nurse. Two hours&rsquo; stay with
      her, that precious time when she knew that sad as the talk often was, it
      was truly a comfort to him. It ended when ten o&rsquo;clock struck, and he went
      down&mdash;Margaret hearing the bell, the sounds of the assembling
      servants, the shutting of the door, the stillness of prayer-time, the
      opening again, the feet moving off in different directions, then brothers
      and sisters coming in to kiss her and bid her good-night, nurse and Flora
      arranging her for the night, Flora coming to sleep in her little bed in
      the corner of the room, and, lastly, her father&rsquo;s tender good-night, and
      melancholy look at her, and all was quiet, except the low voices and
      movements as Richard attended him in his own room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret could think: &ldquo;Dear, dear Ethel, how noble and high she is! But I
      am afraid! It is what people call a difficult, dangerous age, and the
      grander she is, the greater danger of not managing her rightly. If those
      high purposes should run only into romance like mine, or grow out into
      eccentricities and unfemininesses, what a grievous pity it would be! And
      I, so little older, so much less clever, with just sympathy enough not to
      be a wise restraint&mdash;I am the person who has the responsibility, and
      oh, what shall I do? Mamma trusted to me to be a mother to them, papa
      looks to me, and I so unfit, besides this helplessness. But God sent it,
      and put me in my place. He made me lie here, and will raise me up if it is
      good, so I trust He will help me with my sisters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grant me to have a right judgment in all things, and evermore to rejoice
      in Thy holy comfort.&rdquo;

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Something between a hindrance and a help.
                                    WORDSWORTH.
</pre>
    <p>
      Etheldred awoke long before time for getting up, and lay pondering over
      her visions. Margaret had sympathised, and therefore they did not seem
      entirely aerial. To earn money by writing was her favourite plan, and she
      called her various romances in turn before her memory, to judge which
      might be brought down to sober pen and ink. She considered till it became
      not too unreasonably early to get up. It was dark, but there was a little
      light close to the window: she had no writing-paper, but she would
      interline her old exercise-book. Down she ran, and crouching in the
      school-room window-seat, she wrote on in a trance of eager composition,
      till Norman called her, as he went to school, to help him to find a book.
    </p>
    <p>
      This done, she went up to visit Margaret, to tell her the story, and
      consult her. But this was not so easy. She found Margaret with little
      Daisy lying by her, and Tom sitting by the fire over his Latin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Ethel, good-morning, dear! you are come just in time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To take baby?&rdquo; said Ethel, as the child was fretting a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, thank you, she has been very good, but she was tired of lying here,
      and I can&rsquo;t move her about,&rdquo; said Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Margaret, I have such a plan,&rdquo; said Ethel, as she walked about with
      little Gertrude; but Tom interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Margaret, will you see if I can say my lesson?&rdquo; and the thumbed Latin
      grammar came across her just as Dr. May&rsquo;s door opened, and he came in
      exclaiming, &ldquo;Latin grammar! Margaret, this is really too much for you.
      Good-morning, my dears. Ha! Tommy, take your book away, my boy. You must
      not inflict that on sister now. There&rsquo;s your regular master, Richard, in
      my room, if it is fit for his ears yet. What, the little one here too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is your arm, papa?&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;Did it keep you awake?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not long&mdash;it set me dreaming though, and a very romantic dream it
      was, worthy of Ethel herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was it, papa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it was an odd thing, joining on strangely enough with one I had three
      or four and twenty years ago, when I was a young man, hearing lectures at
      Edinburgh, and courting&mdash;&rdquo; he stopped, and felt Margaret&rsquo;s pulse,
      asked her a few questions, and talked to the baby. Ethel longed to hear
      his dream, but thought he would not like to go on; however, he did
      presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old dream was the night after a picnic on Arthur&rsquo;s Seat with the
      Mackenzies; mamma and Aunt Flora were there. &lsquo;Twas a regular boy&rsquo;s dream,
      a tournament, or something of that nature, where I was victor, the queen&mdash;you
      know who she was&mdash;giving me her token&mdash;a Daisy Chain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is why you like to call us your Daisy Chain,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you write it in verse?&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;I think I once saw some
      verses like it in her desk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was in love, and three-and-twenty,&rdquo; said the doctor, looking drolly
      guilty in the midst of his sadness. &ldquo;Ay, those fixed it in my memory,
      perhaps my fancy made it more distinct than it really was. An evening or
      two ago I met with them, and that stirred it up I suppose. Last night came
      the tournament again, but it was the melee, a sense of being crushed down,
      suffocated by the throng of armed knights and horses&mdash;pain and wounds&mdash;and
      I looked in vain through the opposing overwhelming host for my&mdash;my
      Maggie. Well, I got the worst of it, my sword arm was broken&mdash;I fell,
      was stifled&mdash;crushed&mdash;in misery&mdash;all I could do was to
      grasp my token&mdash;my Daisy Chain,&rdquo; and he pressed Margaret&rsquo;s hand as he
      said so. &ldquo;And, behold, the tumult and despair were passed. I lay on the
      grass in the cloisters, and the Daisy Chain hung from the sky, and was
      drawing me upwards. There&mdash;it is a queer dream for a sober old
      country doctor. I don&rsquo;t know why I told you, don&rsquo;t tell any one again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he walked away, muttering. &ldquo;For he told me his dreams, talked of
      eating and drinking,&rdquo; leaving Margaret with her eyes full of tears, and
      Ethel vehemently caressing the baby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How beautiful!&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has been a comfort to him, I am sure,&rdquo; said Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think it ominous,&rdquo; said Ethel with a slight tremulous voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More soothing than anything else. It is what we all feel, is it not? that
      this little daisy bud is the link between us and heaven?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But about him. He was victor at first&mdash;vanquished the next time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think&mdash;if it is to have an interpretation, though I am not sure we
      ought to take it so seriously, it would only mean that in younger days
      people care for victory and distinction in this world, like Norman, or as
      papa most likely did then; but, as they grow older, they care less, and
      others pass them, and they know it does not signify, for in our race all
      may win.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he has a great name. How many people come from a distance to consult
      him! he is looked upon, too, in other ways! he can do anything with the
      corporation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret smiled. &ldquo;All this does not sound grand&mdash;it is not as if he
      had set up in London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear, I am so glad he did not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I tell you what mamma told me he said about it, when Uncle
      Mackenzie said he ought? He answered that he thought health and happy home
      attachments were a better provision for us to set out in life with than
      thousands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure he was right!&rdquo; said Ethel earnestly. &ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t think the
      dream meant being beaten, only that our best things are not gained by
      successes in this world?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go and let it dwell on your mind as a vision,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;I
      think dear mamma would call that silly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An interruption occurred, and Ethel had to go down to breakfast with a
      mind floating between romance, sorrow, and high aspirations, very unlike
      the actual world she had to live in. First, there was a sick man walking
      into the study, and her father, laying down his letters, saying, &ldquo;I must
      despatch him before prayers, I suppose. I&rsquo;ve a great mind to say I never
      will see any one who won&rsquo;t keep to my days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine why they don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Flora, as he went. &ldquo;He is always
      saying so, but never acting on it. If he would once turn one away, the
      rest would mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard went on in silence, cutting bread and butter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s another ring,&rdquo; said Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he is caught now, they&rsquo;ll go on in a stream. I shall not keep
      Margaret waiting for her breakfast, I shall take it up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The morning was tiresome; though Dr. May had two regular days for seeing
      poor people at his house, he was too good-natured to keep strictly to
      them, and this day, as Flora had predicted, there was a procession of them
      not soon got rid of, even by his rapid queries and the talismanic figures
      made by his left hand on scraps of paper, with which he sent them off to
      the infirmary. Ethel tried to read; the children lingered about; it was a
      trial of temper to all but Tom, who obtained Richard&rsquo;s attention to his
      lessons. He liked to say them to his brother, and was an incentive to
      learn them quickly, that none might remain for Miss Winter when Richard
      went out with his father. If mamma had been there, she would have had
      prayers; but now no one had authority enough, though they did at last even
      finish breakfast. Just as the gig came to the door, Dr. May dismissed his
      last patient, rang the bell in haste, and as soon as prayers were over,
      declared he had an appointment, and had no time to eat. There was a
      general outcry that it was bad enough when he was well, and now he must
      not take liberties; Flora made him drink some tea; and Richard placed
      morsels in his way, while he read his letters. He ran up for a final look
      at Margaret, almost upset the staid Miss Winter as he ran down again,
      called Richard to take the reins, and was off.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was French day, always a trial to Ethel. M. Ballompre, the master, knew
      what was good and bad French, but could not render a reason, and Ethel,
      being versed in the principles of grammar, from her Latin studies, chose
      to know the why and wherefore of his corrections&mdash;she did not like to
      see her pages defaced, and have no security against future errors; while
      he thought her a troublesome pupil, and was put out by her questions. They
      wrangled, Miss Winter was displeased, and Ethel felt injured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary&rsquo;s inability to catch the pronunciation, and her hopeless dull look
      when she found that coeur must not be pronounced cour, nor cur, but
      something between, to which her rosy English lips could never come&mdash;all
      this did not tease M. Ballompre, for he was used to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mark for Ethel&rsquo;s lesson was &ldquo;de l&rsquo;humeur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; said Miss Winter, when he was gone. &ldquo;I thought you had
      outgrown that habit of disputing over every phrase.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell how a language is to be learned without knowing the reasons
      of one&rsquo;s mistakes,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what you always say, my dear. It is of no use to renew it all,
      but I wish you would control yourself. Now, Mary, call Blanche, and you
      and Ethel take your arithmetic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Flora went to read to Margaret, while Blanche went lightly and
      playfully through her easy lessons, and Mary floundered piteously over the
      difficulties of Compound Long Division. Ethel&rsquo;s mind was in too irritated
      and tumultuous a state for her to derive her usual solace from Cube Root.
      Her sum was wrong, and she wanted to work it right, but Miss Winter, who
      had little liking for the higher branches of arithmetic, said she had
      spent time enough over it, and summoned her to an examination such as the
      governess was very fond of and often practised. Ethel thought it useless,
      and was teased by it; and though her answers were chiefly correct, they
      were given in an irritated tone. It was of this kind:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        What is the date of the invention of paper?
        What is the latitude and longitude of Otaheite?
        What are the component parts of brass?
        Whence is cochineal imported?
</pre>
    <p>
      When this was over, Ethel had to fetch her mending-basket, and Mary her
      book of selections; the piece for to-day&rsquo;s lesson was the quarrel of
      Brutus and Cassius; and Mary&rsquo;s dull droning tone was a trial to her ears;
      she presently exclaimed, &ldquo;Oh, Mary, don&rsquo;t murder it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Murder what?&rdquo; said Mary, opening wide her light blue eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That use of exaggerated language,&mdash;&rdquo; began Miss Winter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard papa say it,&rdquo; said Ethel, only wanting to silence Miss Winter.
      In a cooler moment she would not have used the argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All that a gentleman may say, may not be a precedent for a young lady;
      but you are interrupting Mary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only let me show her. I can&rsquo;t bear to hear her, listen, Mary.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        &ldquo;What shall one of us
         That struck the foremost&rdquo;&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is declaiming,&rdquo; said Miss Winter. &ldquo;It is not what we wish for in a
      lady. You are neglecting your work and interfering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel made a fretful contortion, and obeyed. So it went on all the
      morning, Ethel&rsquo;s eagerness checked by Miss Winter&rsquo;s dry manner, producing
      pettishness, till Ethel, in a state between self-reproach and a sense of
      injustice, went up to prepare for dinner, and to visit Margaret on the
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      She found her sister picking a merino frock to pieces. &ldquo;See here,&rdquo; she
      said eagerly, &ldquo;I thought you would like to make up this old frock for one
      of the Cocksmoor children; but what is the matter?&rdquo; as Ethel did not show
      the lively interest that she expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nothing, only Miss Winter is so tiresome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything, it was all horrid. I was cross, I know, but she and M.
      Ballompre made me so;&rdquo; and Ethel was in the midst of the narration of her
      grievances, when Norman came in. The school was half a mile off, but he
      had not once failed to come home, in the interval allowed for play after
      dinner, to inquire for his sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Norman, you are out of breath, sit down and rest. What is doing at
      school; are you dux of your class?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the boy wearily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What mark for the verses?&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quam bene.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not optime?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, they were tame,&rdquo; Dr. Hoxton said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is Harry doing?&rdquo; said Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is fourth in his form. I left him at football.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dinner!&rdquo; said Flora at the door. &ldquo;What will you have, Margaret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fetch it,&rdquo; said Norman, who considered it his privilege to wait on
      Margaret at dinner. When he had brought the tray, he stood leaning against
      the bed-post, musing. Suddenly, there was a considerable clatter of
      fire-irons, and his violent start surprised Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ethel has been poking the fire,&rdquo; she said, as if no more was needed to
      account for their insecurity. Norman put them up again, but a ringing
      sound betrayed that it was not with a firm touch, and when, a minute
      after, he came to take her plate, she saw that he was trying with effort
      to steady his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Norman, dear, are you sure you are well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, very well,&rdquo; said he, as if vexed that she had taken any notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better not come racing home. I&rsquo;m not worth inquiries now, I am so
      much better,&rdquo; said she, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made no reply, but this was not consenting silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like you to lose your football,&rdquo; she proceeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not&mdash;&rdquo; and he stopped short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be much better for you,&rdquo; said she, looking up in his face with
      anxious affectionate eyes, but he shunned her glance and walked away with
      her plate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora had been in such close attendance upon Margaret, that she needed
      some cheerful walks, and though she had some doubts how affairs at home
      would go on without her, she was overruled, and sent on a long expedition
      with Miss Winter and Mary, while Ethel remained with Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only delay before setting out, was that nurse came in, saying, &ldquo;If you
      please, Miss Margaret, there is a girl come to see about the place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sisters looked at each other and smiled, while Margaret asked whence
      she came, and who she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her name is Taylor, and she comes from Cocksmoor, but she is a nice,
      tidy, strong-looking girl, and she says she has been used to children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nurse had fallen into the trap most comfortably, and seemed bent upon
      taking this girl as a choice of her own. She wished to know if Miss
      Margaret would like to see her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you please, nurse, but if you think she will do, that is enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Miss, but you should look to them things yourself. If you please,
      I&rsquo;ll bring her up.&rdquo; So nurse departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charming!&rdquo; cried Ethel, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s your capital management, Flora; nurse
      thinks she has done it all herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is your charge though,&rdquo; said Flora, &ldquo;coming from your own beloved
      Cocksmoor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucy Taylor came in, looking very nice, and very shy, curtseying low, in
      extreme awe of the pale lady in bed. Margaret was much pleased with her,
      and there was no more to be done but to settle that she should come on
      Saturday, and to let nurse take her into the town to invest her with the
      universal blackness of the household, where the two Margarets were the
      only white things.
    </p>
    <p>
      This arranged, and the walking party set forth, Ethel sat down by her
      sister&rsquo;s bed, and began to assist in unpicking the merino, telling
      Margaret how much obliged she was to her for thinking of it, and how
      grieved at having been so ungrateful in the morning. She was very happy
      over her contrivances, cutting out under her sister&rsquo;s superintendence. She
      had forgotten the morning&rsquo;s annoyance, till Margaret said, &ldquo;I have been
      thinking of what you said about Miss Winter, and really I don&rsquo;t know what
      is to be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Margaret, I did not mean to worry you,&rdquo; said Ethel, sorry to see her
      look uneasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like you to tell me everything, dear Ethel; but I don&rsquo;t see clearly the
      best course. We must go on with Miss Winter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Ethel, shocked at her murmurs having even suggested the
      possibility of a change, and having, as well as all the others, a great
      respect and affection for her governess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We could not get on without her even if I were well,&rdquo; continued Margaret;
      &ldquo;and dear mamma had such perfect trust in her, and we all know and love
      her so well&mdash;it would make us put up with a great deal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all my own fault,&rdquo; said Ethel, only anxious to make amends to Miss
      Winter. &ldquo;I wish you would not say anything about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it does seem wrong even to think of it,&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;when she
      has been so very kind. It is a blessing to have any one to whom Mary and
      Blanche may so entirely be trusted. But for you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my own fault,&rdquo; repeated Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it is quite all your own fault,&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;and that
      is the difficulty. I know dear mamma thought Miss Winter an excellent
      governess for the little ones, but hardly up to you, and she saw that you
      worried and fidgeted each other, so, you know, she used to keep the
      teaching of you a good deal in her own hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not know that was the reason,&rdquo; said Ethel, overpowered by the
      recollection of the happy morning&rsquo;s work she had often done in that very
      room, when her mother had not been equal to the bustle of the whole
      school-room. That watchful, protecting, guarding, mother&rsquo;s love, a shadow
      of Providence, had been round them so constantly on every side, that they
      had been hardly conscious of it till it was lost to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it not like her?&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;but now, my poor Ethel, I don&rsquo;t
      think it would be right by you or by Miss Winter, to take you out of the
      school-room. I think it would grieve her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would not do that for the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Especially after her kind nursing of me, and even, with more reason, it
      would not be becoming in us to make changes. Besides, King Etheldred,&rdquo;
       said Margaret, smiling, &ldquo;we all know you are a little bit of a sloven,
      and, as nurse says, some one must be always after you, and do you know?
      even if I were well, I had rather it was Miss Winter than me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, you would not be formal and precise&mdash;you would not make me
      cross.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you might make me so,&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;or I should let you alone,
      and leave you a slattern. We should both hate it so! No, don&rsquo;t make me
      your mistress, Ethel dear&mdash;let me be your sister and play-fellow
      still, as well as I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are, you are. I don&rsquo;t care half so much when I have got you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And will you try to bear with her, and remember it is right in the main,
      though it is troublesome?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I will. I won&rsquo;t plague you again. I know it is bad for you, you look
      tired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray don&rsquo;t leave off telling me,&rdquo; said Margaret&mdash;&ldquo;it is just what I
      wish on my own account, and I know it is comfortable to have a good
      grumble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it does not hurt you, but I am sure you are not easy now&mdash;are
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only my back,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;I have been sitting up longer than usual,
      and it is tired. Will you call nurse to lay me flat again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The nursery was deserted&mdash;all were out, and Ethel came back in
      trepidation at the notion of having to do it herself, though she knew it
      was only to put one arm to support her sister, while, with the other, she
      removed the pillows; but Ethel was conscious of her own awkwardness and
      want of observation, nor had Margaret entire trust in her. Still she was
      too much fatigued to wait, so Ethel was obliged to do her best. She was
      careful and frightened, and therefore slow and unsteady. She trusted that
      all was right, and Margaret tried to believe so, though still uneasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel began to read to her, and Dr. May came home. She looked up smiling,
      and asked where he had been, but it was vain to try to keep him from
      reading her face. He saw in an instant that something was amiss, and drew
      from her a confession that her back was aching a little. He knew she might
      have said a great deal&mdash;she was not in a comfortable position&mdash;she
      must be moved. She shook her head&mdash;she had rather wait&mdash;there
      was a dread of being again lifted by Ethel that she could not entirely
      hide. Ethel was distressed, Dr. May was angry, and, no wonder, when he saw
      Margaret suffer, felt his own inability to help, missed her who had been
      wont to take all care from his hands, and was vexed to see a tall strong
      girl of fifteen, with the full use of both arms, and plenty of sense,
      incapable of giving any assistance, and only doing harm by trying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is of no use,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Ethel will give no attention to anything but
      her books! I&rsquo;ve a great mind to put an end to all the Latin and Greek! She
      cares for nothing else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel could little brook injustice, and much as she was grieving, she
      exclaimed, &ldquo;Papa, papa, I do care&mdash;now don&rsquo;t I, Margaret? I did my
      best!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk nonsense. Your best, indeed! If you had taken the most
      moderate care&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe Ethel took rather too much care,&rdquo; said Margaret, much more
      harassed by the scolding than by the pain. &ldquo;It will be all right
      presently. Never mind, dear papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he was not only grieved for the present, but anxious for the future;
      and, though he knew it was bad for Margaret to manifest his displeasure,
      he could not restrain it, and continued to blame Ethel with enough of
      injustice to set her on vindication, whereupon he silenced her, by telling
      her she was making it worse by self-justification when Margaret ought to
      be quiet. Margaret tried to talk of other things, but was in too much
      discomfort to exert herself enough to divert his attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Flora returned, and saw in an instant what was wanted. Margaret
      was settled in the right posture, but the pain would not immediately
      depart, and Dr. May soon found out that she had a headache, of which he
      knew he was at least as guilty as Etheldred could be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing could be done but keep her quiet, and Ethel went away to be
      miserable; Flora tried to comfort her by saying it was unfortunate, but no
      doubt there was a knack, and everyone could not manage those things;
      Margaret was easier now, and as to papa&rsquo;s anger, he did not always mean
      all he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      But consolation came at bedtime; Margaret received her with open arms when
      she went to wish her goodnight. &ldquo;My poor Ethel,&rdquo; she said, holding her
      close, &ldquo;I am sorry I have made such a fuss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you did not, it was too bad of me&mdash;I am grieved; are you quite
      comfortable now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, quite, only a little headache, which I shall sleep off. It has been
      so nice and quiet. Papa took up George Herbert, and has been reading me
      choice bits. I don&rsquo;t think I have enjoyed anything so much since I have
      been ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad of that, but I have been unhappy all the evening. I wish I knew
      what to do. I am out of heart about everything!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only try to mind and heed, and you will learn. It will be a step if you
      will only put your shoes side by side when you take them off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel smiled and sighed, and Margaret whispered, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t grieve about me,
      but put your clever head to rule your hands, and you will do for home and
      Cocksmoor too. Good-night, dearest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve vexed papa,&rdquo; sighed Ethel&mdash;and just then he came into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa,&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s poor Ethel, not half recovered from her
      troubles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was now at ease about Margaret, and knew he had been harsh to another
      of his motherless girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! we must send her to the infant-school, to learn &lsquo;this is my right
      hand, and this is my left,&rsquo;&rdquo; said he, in his half-gay, half-sad manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was very stupid,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor child!&rdquo; said her papa, &ldquo;she is worse off than I am. If I have but
      one hand left, she has two left hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do mean to try, papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you must, Ethel. I believe I was hasty with you, my poor girl. I was
      vexed, and we have no one to smooth us down. I am sorry, my dear, but you
      must bear with me, for I never learned her ways with you when I might. We
      will try to have more patience with each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What could Ethel do but hang round his neck and cry, till he said, but
      tenderly, that they had given Margaret quite disturbance enough to-day,
      and sent her to bed, vowing to watch each little action, lest she should
      again give pain to such a father and sister.

      CHAPTER VIII.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Tis not enough that Greek or Roman page
      At stated hours, his freakish thoughts engage,
      Even in his pastimes he requires a friend
      To warn and teach him safely to unbend,
      O&rsquo;er all his pleasures gently to preside,
      Watch his emotions, and control their tide.&rdquo;&mdash;COWPER.
</pre>
    <p>
      The misfortunes of that day disheartened and disconcerted Etheldred. To do
      mischief where she most wished to do good, to grieve where she longed to
      comfort, seemed to be her fate; it was vain to attempt anything for
      anyone&rsquo;s good, while all her warm feelings and high aspirations were
      thwarted by the awkward ungainly hands and heedless eyes that Nature had
      given her. Nor did the following day, Saturday, do much for her comfort,
      by giving her the company of her brothers. That it was Norman&rsquo;s sixteenth
      birthday seemed only to make it worse. Their father had apparently
      forgotten it, and Norman stopped Blanche when she was going to put him in
      mind of it; stopped her by such a look as the child never forgot, though
      there was no anger in it. In reply to Ethel&rsquo;s inquiry what he was going to
      do that morning, he gave a yawn and stretch, and said, dejectedly, that he
      had got some Euripides to look over, and some verses to finish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry; this is the first time you ever have not managed so as to
      make a real holiday of your Saturday!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not help it, and there&rsquo;s nothing to do,&rdquo; said Norman wearily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promised to go and read to Margaret while Flora does her music,&rdquo; said
      Ethel; &ldquo;I shall come after that and do my Latin and Greek with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret would not keep her long, saying she liked her to be with Norman,
      but she found him with his head sunk on his open book, fast asleep. At
      dinner-time, Harry and Tom, rushing in, awoke him with a violent start.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Halloo! Norman, that was a jump!&rdquo; said Harry, as his brother stretched
      and pinched himself. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll jump out of your skin some of these days, if
      you don&rsquo;t take care!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s enough to startle any one to be waked up with such a noise,&rdquo; said
      Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he ought to sleep at proper times,&rdquo; said Harry, &ldquo;and not be waking
      me up with tumbling about, and hallooing out, and talking in his sleep
      half the night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talking in his sleep! why, just now, you said he did not sleep,&rdquo; said
      Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harry knows nothing about it,&rdquo; said Norman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I? Well, I only know, if you slept in school, and were a junior,
      you would get a proper good licking for going on as you do at night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I think you might chance to get a proper good licking for not holding
      your tongue,&rdquo; said Norman, which hint reduced Harry to silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. May was not come home; he had gone with Richard far into the country,
      and was to return to tea. He was thought to be desirous of avoiding the
      family dinners that used to be so delightful. Harry was impatient to
      depart, and when Mary and Tom ran after him, he ordered them back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where can he be going?&rdquo; said Mary, as she looked wistfully after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where? Do tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only don&rsquo;t tell papa. I went down with him to the playground this
      morning, and there they settled it. The Andersons, and Axworthy, and he,
      are going to hire a gun, and shoot pee-wits on Cocksmoor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they ought not; should they?&rdquo; said Mary. &ldquo;Papa would be very angry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anderson said there was no harm in it, but Harry told me not to tell.
      Indeed, Anderson would have boxed my ears for hearing, when I could not
      help it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Harry would not let him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay. Harry is quite a match for Harvey Anderson, though he is so much
      younger; and he said he would not have me bullied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good Harry! But I wish he would not go out shooting!&rdquo; said Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mind, you don&rsquo;t tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where&rsquo;s Hector Ernescliffe? Would not he go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I like Hector. He did not choose to go, though Anderson teased him,
      and said he was a poor Scot, and his brother didn&rsquo;t allow him tin enough
      to buy powder and shot. If Harry would have stayed at home, he would have
      come up here, and we might have had some fun in the garden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish he would. We never have any fun now,&rdquo; said Mary; &ldquo;but oh! there he
      is,&rdquo; as she spied Hector peeping over the gate which led from the field
      into the garden. It was the first time that he had been to Dr. May&rsquo;s since
      his brother&rsquo;s departure, and he was rather shy, but the joyful welcome of
      Mary and Tom took off all reluctance, and they claimed him for a good game
      at play in the wood-house. Mary ran upstairs to beg to be excused the
      formal walk, and, luckily for her, Miss Winter was in Margaret&rsquo;s room.
      Margaret asked if it was very wet and dirty, and hearing &ldquo;not very,&rdquo; gave
      gracious permission, and off went Mary and Blanche to construct some
      curious specimens of pottery, under the superintendence of Hector and Tom.
      There was a certain ditch where yellow mud was attainable, whereof the
      happy children concocted marbles and vases, which underwent a preparatory
      baking in the boys&rsquo; pockets, that they might not crack in the nursery
      fire. Margaret only stipulated that her sisters should be well fenced in
      brown holland, and when Miss Winter looked grave, said, &ldquo;Poor things, a
      little thorough play will do them a great deal of good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Winter could not see the good of groping in the dirt; and Margaret
      perceived that it would be one of her difficulties to know how to follow
      out her mother&rsquo;s views for the children, without vexing the good governess
      by not deferring to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, Norman had disconsolately returned to his Euripides, and
      Ethel, who wanted to stay with him and look out his words, was ordered out
      by Miss Winter, because she had spent all yesterday indoors. Miss Winter
      was going to stay with Margaret, and Ethel and Flora coaxed Norman to come
      with them, &ldquo;just one mile on the turnpike road and back again; he would be
      much fresher for his Greek afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He came, but he did not enliven his sisters. The three plodded on, taking
      a diligent constitutional walk, exchanging very few words, and those
      chiefly between the girls. Flora gathered some hoary clematis, and red
      berries, and sought in the hedge-sides for some crimson &ldquo;fairy baths&rdquo; to
      carry home; and, at the sight of the amusement Margaret derived from the
      placing the beauteous little Pezizas in a saucer of damp green moss, so as
      to hide the brown sticks on which they grew, Ethel took shame to herself
      for want of perception of little attentions. When she told Norman so, he
      answered, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no one who does see what is the right thing. How horrid
      the room looks! Everything is nohow!&rdquo; added he, looking round at the
      ornaments and things on the tables, which had lost their air of comfort
      and good taste. It was not disorder, and Ethel could not see what he
      meant. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, never mind&mdash;you can&rsquo;t do it. Don&rsquo;t try&mdash;you&rsquo;ll only make it
      worse. It will never be the same as long as we live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you would not be so unhappy!&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; again said Norman, but he put his arm round her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you done your Euripides? Can I help you? Will you construe it with
      me, or shall I look out your words?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, I don&rsquo;t mind that. It is the verses! I want some sense!&rdquo; said
      Norman, running his fingers through his hair till it stood on end. &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis
      such a horrid subject, Coral Islands! As if there was anything to be said
      about them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me, Norman, I could say ten thousand things, only I must not tell
      you what mine are, as yours are not done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Norman decidedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you read the description of them in the Quarterly? I am sure you
      might get some ideas there. Shall I find it for you? It is in an old
      number.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, do; thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rested listlessly on the sofa while his sister rummaged in a
      chiffonier. At last she found the article, and eagerly read him the
      description of the strange forms of the coral animals, and the beauties of
      their flower-like feelers and branching fabrics. It would once have
      delighted him, but his first comment was, &ldquo;Nasty little brutes!&rdquo; However,
      the next minute he thanked her, took the book, and said he could hammer
      something out of it, though it was too bad to give such an unclassical
      subject. At dusk he left off, saying he should get it done at night, his
      senses would come then, and he should be glad to sit up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only three weeks to the holidays,&rdquo; said Ethel, trying to be cheerful; but
      his assent was depressing, and she began to fear that Christmas would only
      make them more sad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary did not keep Tom&rsquo;s secret so inviolably, but that, while they were
      dressing for tea, she revealed to Ethel where Harry was gone. He was not
      yet returned, though his father and Richard were come in, and the sisters
      were at once in some anxiety on his account, and doubt whether they ought
      to let papa know of his disobedience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora and Ethel, who were the first in the drawing-room, had a
      consultation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have told mamma directly,&rdquo; said Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He never did so,&rdquo; sighed Ethel; &ldquo;things never went wrong then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, they did; don&rsquo;t you remember how naughty Harry was about
      climbing the wall, and making faces at Mrs. Richardson&rsquo;s servants?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how ill I behaved the first day of last Christmas holidays?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She knew, but I don&rsquo;t think she told papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that we knew of, but I believe she did tell him everything, and I
      think, Flora, he ought to know everything, especially now. I never could
      bear the way the Mackenzies used to have of thinking their parents must be
      like enemies, and keeping secrets from them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were always threatening each other, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell mamma,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Flora,
      &ldquo;and calling us tell-tales because we told our own dear mamma everything.
      But it is not like that now&mdash;I neither like to worry papa, nor to
      bring Harry into disgrace&mdash;besides, Tom and Mary meant it for a
      secret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa would not be angry with him if we told him it was a secret,&rdquo; said
      Ethel; &ldquo;I wish Harry would come in. There&rsquo;s the door&mdash;oh! it is only
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom did you expect?&rdquo; said Richard, entering.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sisters looked at each other, and Ethel, after an interval, explained
      their doubts about Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is come in,&rdquo; said Richard; &ldquo;I saw him running up to his own room, very
      muddy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m glad! But do you think papa ought to hear it? I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s
      to be done. &lsquo;Tis the children&rsquo;s secret,&rdquo; said Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will never do to have him going out with those boys continually,&rdquo; said
      Ethel&mdash;&ldquo;Harvey Anderson close by all the holidays!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try what I can do with him,&rdquo; said Richard. &ldquo;Papa had better not hear
      it now, at any rate. He is very tired and sad this evening! and his arm is
      painful again, so we must not worry him with histories of naughtiness
      among the children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Ethel decidedly, &ldquo;I am glad you were there, Ritchie; I never
      should have thought of one time being better than another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just like Ethel!&rdquo; said Flora, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should not you learn?&rdquo; said Richard gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Ethel, in a desponding way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? You are much sharper than most people, and, if you tried, you
      would know those things much better than I do, as you know how to learn
      history.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is quite a different sort of cleverness,&rdquo; said Flora. &ldquo;Recollect Sir
      Isaac Newton, or Archimedes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you must have both sorts,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;for you can do things
      nicely, and yet you learn very fast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care, Ethel, you are singeing your frock! Well, I really don&rsquo;t think
      you can help those things!&rdquo; said Flora. &ldquo;Your short sight is the reason of
      it, and it is of no use to try to mend it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell her so,&rdquo; said Richard. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be all short sight&mdash;it
      is the not thinking. I do believe that if Ethel would think, no one would
      do things so well. Don&rsquo;t you remember the beautiful perspective drawing
      she made of this room for me to take to Oxford? That was very difficult,
      and wanted a great deal of neatness and accuracy, so why should she not be
      neat and accurate in other things? And I know you can read faces, Ethel&mdash;why
      don&rsquo;t you look there before you speak?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! before instead of after, when I only see I have said something
      malapropos,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go and see about the children,&rdquo; said Flora; &ldquo;if the tea comes
      while I am gone, will you make it, Ritchie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flora despairs of me,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Richard. &ldquo;Have you forgotten how to put in a pin yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I hope not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, see if you can&rsquo;t learn to make tea; and, by-the-bye, Ethel,
      which is the next christening Sunday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The one after next, surely. The first of December is Monday&mdash;yes,
      to-morrow week is the next.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I have thought of something; it would cost eighteenpence to hire
      Joliffe&rsquo;s spring-cart, and we might have Mrs. Taylor and the twins brought
      to church in it. Should you like to walk to Cocksmoor and settle it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, very much indeed. What a capital thought. Margaret said you would
      know how to manage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we will go the first fine day papa does not want me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if I could finish my purple frocks. But here&rsquo;s the tea. Now,
      Richard, don&rsquo;t tell me to make it. I should do something wrong, and Flora
      will never forgive you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard would not let her off. He stood over her, counted her shovelfuls
      of tea, and watched the water into the teapot&mdash;he superintended her
      warming the cups, and putting a drop into each saucer. &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Ethel,
      with a concluding sigh, &ldquo;it makes one hotter than double equations!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was all right, as Flora allowed with a slightly superior smile. She
      thought Richard would never succeed in making a notable or elegant woman
      of Ethel, and it was best that the two sisters should take different
      lines. Flora knew that, though clever and with more accomplishments, she
      could not surpass Ethel in intellectual attainments, but she was certainly
      far more valuable in the house, and had been proved to have just the
      qualities in which her sister was most deficient. She did not relish
      hearing that Ethel wanted nothing but attention to be more than her equal,
      and she thought Richard mistaken. Flora&rsquo;s remembrance of their time of
      distress was less unmixedly wretched than it was with the others, for she
      knew she had done wonders.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day Norman told Ethel that he had got on very well with the
      verses, and finished them off late at night. He showed them to her before
      taking them to school on Monday morning, and Ethel thought they were the
      best he had ever written. There was too much spirit and poetical beauty
      for a mere schoolboy task, and she begged for the foul copy to show it to
      her father. &ldquo;I have not got it,&rdquo; said Norman. &ldquo;The foul copy was not like
      these; but when I was writing them out quite late, it was all I don&rsquo;t know
      how. Flora&rsquo;s music was in my ears, and the room seemed to get larger, and
      like an ocean cave; and when the candle flickered, &lsquo;twas like the green
      glowing light of the sun through the waves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As it says here,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the words all came to me of themselves in beautiful flowing Latin,
      just right, as if it was anybody but myself doing it, and they ran off my
      pen in red and blue and gold, and all sorts of colours; and fine branching
      zig-zagging stars, like what the book described, only stranger, came
      dancing and radiating round my pen and the candle. I could hardly believe
      the verses would scan by daylight, but I can&rsquo;t find a mistake. Do you try
      them again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel scanned. &ldquo;I see nothing wrong,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but it seems a shame to
      begin scanning Undine&rsquo;s verses, they are too pretty. I wish I could copy
      them. It must have been half a dream.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe it was; they don&rsquo;t seem like my own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you dream afterwards?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shivered. &ldquo;They had got into my head too much; my ears sang like the
      roaring of the sea, and I thought my feet were frozen on to an iceberg:
      then came darkness, and sea monsters, and drowning&mdash;it was too
      horrid!&rdquo; and his face expressed all, and more than all, he said. &ldquo;But &lsquo;tis
      a quarter to seven&mdash;we must go,&rdquo; said he, with a long yawn, and
      rubbing his eyes. &ldquo;You are sure they are right, Ethel? Harry, come along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel thought those verses ought to make a sensation, but all that came of
      them was a Quam optime, and when she asked Norman if no special notice had
      been taken of them, he said, in his languid way, &ldquo;No; only Dr. Hoxton said
      they were better than usual.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel did not even have the satisfaction of hearing that Mr. Wilmot,
      happening to meet Dr. May, said to him, &ldquo;Your boy has more of a poet in
      him than any that has come in my way. He really sometimes makes very
      striking verses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard watched for an opportunity of speaking to Harry, which did not at
      once occur, as the boy spent very little of his time at home, and, as if
      by tacit consent, he and Norman came in later every evening. At last, on
      Thursday, in the additional two hours&rsquo; leisure allowed to the boys, when
      the studious prepared their tasks, and the idle had some special
      diversion, Richard encountered him running up to his own room to fetch a
      newly-invented instrument for projecting stones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll walk back to school with you,&rdquo; said Richard. &ldquo;I mean to run,&rdquo;
       returned Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there so much hurry?&rdquo; said Richard. &ldquo;I am sorry for it, for I wanted
      to speak to you, Harry; I have something to show you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His manner conveyed that it related to their mother, and the sobering
      effect was instantaneous. &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said he, forgetting his haste.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come into your room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The awe-struck, shy, yet sorrowful look on his rosy face showed
      preparation enough, and Richard&rsquo;s only preface was to say, &ldquo;It is a bit of
      a letter that she was in course of writing to Aunt Flora, a description of
      us all. The letter itself is gone, but here is a copy of it. I thought you
      would like to read what relates to yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard laid before him the sheet of notepaper on which this portion of
      the letter was written, and left him alone with it, while he set out on
      the promised walk with Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      They found the old woman, Granny Hall, looking like another creature,
      smoke-dried and withered indeed, but all briskness and animation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! be it you, sir, and the young lady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; here we are come to see you again,&rdquo; said Richard. &ldquo;I hope you are
      not disappointed that I&rsquo;ve brought my sister this time instead of the
      doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, sir; I&rsquo;ve done with the doctor for this while,&rdquo; said the old
      woman, to Ethel&rsquo;s great amusement. &ldquo;He have done me a power of good, and
      thank him for it heartily; but the young lady is right welcome here&mdash;but
      &lsquo;tis a dirty walk for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind that,&rdquo; said Ethel, a little shyly, &ldquo;I came&mdash;where are
      your grandchildren?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, somewhere out among the blocks. They gets out with the other
      children; I can&rsquo;t be always after them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanted to know if these would fit them,&rdquo; said Ethel, beginning to undo
      her basket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, &lsquo;pon my word! If ever I see! Here!&rdquo; stepping out to the door,
      &ldquo;Polly&mdash;Jenny! come in, I say, this moment! Come in, ye bad girls, or
      I&rsquo;ll give you the stick; I&rsquo;ll break every bone of you, that I will!&rdquo; all
      which threats were bawled out in such a good-natured, triumphant voice,
      and with such a delighted air, that Richard and Ethel could not help
      laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a few moments, Polly and Jenny made their appearance, extremely
      rough and ragged, but compelled by their grandmother to duck down, by way
      of courtesies, and, with finger in mouth, they stood, too shy to show
      their delight, as the garments were unfolded; Granny talking so fast that
      Ethel would never have brought in the stipulation, that the frocks should
      be worn to school and church, if Richard, in his mild, but steady way, had
      not brought the old woman to listen to it. She was full of asseverations
      that they should go; she took them to church sometimes herself, when it
      was fine weather and they had clothes, and they could say their catechiz
      as well as anybody already; yes, they should come, that they should, and
      next Sunday. Ethel promised to be there to introduce them to the chief
      lady, the president of the Committee, Mrs. Ledwich, and, with a profusion
      of thanks, they took leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      They found John Taylor, just come out of the hospital, looking weak and
      ill, as he smoked his pipe over the fire, his wife bustling about at a
      great rate, and one of the infants crying. It seemed to be a great relief
      that they were not come to complain of Lucy, and there were many looks of
      surprise on hearing what their business really was. Mrs. Taylor thanked
      them, and appeared not to know whether she was glad or sorry; and her
      husband, pipe in hand, gazed at the young gentleman as if he did not
      comprehend the species, since he could not be old enough to be a
      clergyman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard hoped they would find sponsors by that time; and there Mrs. Taylor
      gave little hope; it was a bad lot&mdash;there was no one she liked to ask
      to stand, she said, in a dismal voice; but there her husband put in, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
      find some one if that&rsquo;s all; my missus always thinks nobody can&rsquo;t do
      nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure,&rdquo; said the lamentable Mrs. Taylor, &ldquo;all the elder ones was
      took to church, and I&rsquo;m loath the little ones shouldn&rsquo;t; but you see, sir,
      we are poor people, and it&rsquo;s a long way, and they was set down in the
      gentleman&rsquo;s register book.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you know that is not the same, Mrs. Taylor. Surely Lucy could have
      told you that, when she went to school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, &lsquo;tis not the same&mdash;I knows that; but this is a bad place to
      live in&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always the old song, missus!&rdquo; exclaimed her husband. &ldquo;Thank you kindly,
      sir&mdash;you have been a good friend to us, and so was Dr. May, when I
      was up to the hospital, through the thick of his own troubles. I believe
      you are in the right of it, sir, and thank you. The children shall be
      ready, and little Jack too, and I&rsquo;ll find gossips, and let &lsquo;em christened
      on Sunday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you will be glad of it,&rdquo; said Richard; and he went on to speak
      of the elder children coming to school on Sunday, thus causing another
      whining from the wife about distance and bad weather, and no one else
      going that way. He said the little Halls were coming, but Mrs. Taylor
      begun saying she disliked their company for the children&mdash;granny let
      them get about so much, and they said bad words. The father again
      interfered. Perhaps Mr. Wilmot, who acted as chaplain at the hospital, had
      been talking to him, for he declared at once that they should come; and
      Richard suggested that he might see them home when he came from church;
      then, turning to the boy and girl, told them they would meet their sister
      Lucy, and asked them if they would not like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the whole, the beginning was not inauspicious, though there might be a
      doubt whether old Mrs. Hall would keep all her promises. Ethel was so much
      diverted and pleased as to be convinced she would; Richard was a little
      doubtful as to her power over the wild girls. There could not be any doubt
      that John Taylor was in earnest, and had been worked upon just at the
      right moment; but there was danger that the impression would not last.
      &ldquo;And his wife is such a horrible whining dawdle!&rdquo; said Ethel&mdash;&ldquo;there
      will be no good to be done if it depends on her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard made no answer, and Ethel presently felt remorseful for her harsh
      speech about a poor ignorant woman, overwhelmed with poverty, children,
      and weak health.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been thinking a great deal about what you said last time we took
      this walk,&rdquo; said Richard, after a considerable interval.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, have you!&rdquo; cried Ethel eagerly; and the black peaty pond she was
      looking at seemed to sparkle with sunlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really mean it?&rdquo; said Richard deliberately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, to be sure;&rdquo; she said, with some indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I think I see a way to make a beginning, but you must make up
      your mind to a great deal of trouble, and dirty walks, and you must really
      learn not to draggle your frock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well; but tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is what I was thinking. I don&rsquo;t think I can go back to Oxford after
      Christmas. It is not fit to leave you while papa is so disabled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no, he could not get on at all. I heard him tell Mr. Wilmot the other
      day that you were his right hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel was glad she had repeated this, for there was a deepening colour and
      smiling glow of pleasure on her brother&rsquo;s face, such as she had seldom
      seen on his delicate, but somewhat impassive features.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is very kind!&rdquo; he said warmly. &ldquo;No, I am sure I cannot be spared till
      he is better able to use his arm, and I don&rsquo;t see any chance of that just
      yet. Then if I stay at home, Friday is always at my own disposal, while
      papa is at the hospital meeting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, and we could go to Cocksmoor, and set up a school. How
      delightful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you would find it quite so delightful as you fancy,&rdquo; said
      Richard; &ldquo;the children will be very wild and ignorant, and you don&rsquo;t like
      that at the National School.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but they are in such need, besides there will be no Mrs. Ledwich over
      me. It is just right&mdash;I shan&rsquo;t mind anything. You are a capital
      Ritchie, for having thought of it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think&mdash;if I am ever to be what I wish, that is, if I can get
      through at Oxford&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think it can be wrong to begin this, if
      Mr. Ramsden does not object.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Ramsden never objects to anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if Mr. Wilmot will come and set us off. You know we cannot begin
      without that, or without my father&rsquo;s fully liking it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! there can be no doubt of that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This one thing, Ethel, I must stipulate. Don&rsquo;t you go and tell it all out
      at once to him. I cannot have him worried about our concerns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how&mdash;no one can question that this is right. I am sure he won&rsquo;t
      object.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, Ethel, don&rsquo;t you see, it can&rsquo;t be done for nothing? If we undertake
      it, we must go on with it, and when I am away it will fall on you and
      Flora. Well, then, it ought to be considered whether you are old enough
      and steady enough; and if it can be managed for you to go continually all
      this way, in this wild place. There will be expense too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel looked wild with impatience, but could not gainsay these scruples,
      otherwise than by declaring they ought not to weigh against the good of
      Cocksmoor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will worry him to have to consider all this,&rdquo; said Richard, &ldquo;and it
      must not be pressed upon him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Ethel sorrowfully; &ldquo;but you don&rsquo;t mean to give it up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are always in extremes, Ethel. All I want is to find a good time for
      proposing it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She fidgeted and gave a long sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mind,&rdquo; said Richard, stopping short, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have nothing to do with it
      except on condition you are patient, and hold your tongue about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I can, if I may talk to Margaret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, to Margaret of course. We could not settle anything without her
      help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I know what she will say,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;Oh, I am so glad,&rdquo; and she
      jumped over three puddles in succession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, Ethel, you must learn to keep your frock out of the dirt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do anything, if you&rsquo;ll help me at Cocksmoor.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER IX.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     For the structure that we raise,
       Time is with materials filled;
     Our to-days and yesterdays,
       Are the blocks which we build.

     Truly shape and fashion these,
       Leave no yawning gaps between;
     Think not, because no man sees,
       Such things will remain unseen.&mdash;LONGFELLOW.
</pre>
    <p>
      When Ethel came home, burning with the tidings of the newly-excited hopes
      for Cocksmoor, they were at once stopped by Margaret eagerly saying, &ldquo;Is
      Richard come in? pray call him;&rdquo; then on his entrance, &ldquo;Oh, Richard, would
      you be so kind as to take this to the bank. I don&rsquo;t like to send it by any
      one else&mdash;it is so much;&rdquo; and she took from under her pillows a
      velvet bag, so heavy, that it weighed down her slender white hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, he has given you the care of his money?&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I saw him turning something out of his waistcoat-pocket into the
      drawer of the looking-glass, and sighing in that very sad way. He said his
      fees had come to such an accumulation that he must see about sending them
      to the bank; and then he told me of the delight of throwing his first fee
      into dear mamma&rsquo;s lap, when they were just married, and his old uncle had
      given up to him, and how he had brought them to her ever since; he said
      she had spoiled him by taking all trouble off his hands. He looked at it,
      as if it was so sorrowful to him to have to dispose of it, that I begged
      him not to plague himself any more, but let me see about it, as dear mamma
      used to do; so he said I was spoiling him too, but he brought me the
      drawer, and emptied it out here: when he was gone, I packed it up, and I
      have been waiting to ask Richard to take it all to the bank, out of his
      sight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You counted it?&rdquo; said Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;there&rsquo;s fifty&mdash;I kept seventeen towards the week&rsquo;s
      expenses. Just see that it is right,&rdquo; said Margaret, showing her neat
      packets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Ritchie,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;what can expense signify, when all that has
      been kicking about loose in an open drawer? What would not one of those
      rolls do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I had better take them out of your way,&rdquo; said Richard quietly.
      &ldquo;Am I to bring back the book to you, Margaret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, do,&rdquo; said Margaret; &ldquo;pray do not tease him with it.&rdquo; And as her
      brother left the room, she continued, &ldquo;I wish he was better. I think he is
      more oppressed now than even at first. The pain of his arm, going on so
      long, seems to me to have pulled him down; it does not let him sleep, and,
      by the end of the day, he gets worn and fagged by seeing so many people,
      and exerting himself to talk and think; and often, when there is something
      that must be asked, I don&rsquo;t know how to begin, for it seems as if a little
      more would be too much for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Richard is right,&rdquo; said Ethel mournfully; &ldquo;it will not do to press
      him about our concerns; but do you think him worse to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did not sleep last night, and he is always worse when he does not
      drive out into the country; the fresh air, and being alone with Richard,
      are a rest for him. To-day is especially trying; he does not think poor
      old Mr. Southern will get through the evening, and he is so sorry for the
      daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he there now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; he thought of something that might be an alleviation, and he would
      go, though he was tired. I am afraid the poor daughter will detain him,
      and he is not fit to go through such things now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I hope he will soon come; perhaps Richard will meet him. But, oh,
      Margaret, what do you think Richard and I have been talking of?&rdquo; and,
      without perception of fit times and seasons, Ethel would have told her
      story, but Margaret, too anxious to attend to her, said, &ldquo;Hark! was not
      that his step?&rdquo; and Dr. May came in, looking mournful and fatigued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I was just too late. He died as I got there, and I could
      not leave the daughter till old Mrs. Bowers came.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor thing,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;He was a good old man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Dr. May, sitting wearily down, and speaking in a worn-out
      voice. &ldquo;One can&rsquo;t lightly part with a man one has seen at church every
      Sunday of one&rsquo;s life, and exchanged so many friendly words with over his
      counter. &lsquo;Tis a strong bond of neighbourliness in a small place like this,
      and, as one grows old, changes come heavier&mdash;&lsquo;the clouds return again
      after the rain.&rsquo; Thank you, my dear,&rdquo; as Ethel fetched his slippers, and
      placed a stool for his feet, feeling somewhat ashamed of thinking it an
      achievement to have, unbidden, performed a small act of attention which
      would have come naturally from any of the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa, you will give me the treat of drinking tea with me?&rdquo; said Margaret,
      who saw the quiet of her room would suit him better than the bustle of the
      children downstairs. &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; as he gave a smile of assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      That Margaret could not be made to listen this evening was plain, and all
      that Ethel could do, was to search for some books on schools. In seeking
      for them, she displayed such confusion in the chiffonier, that Flora
      exclaimed, &ldquo;Oh, Ethel, how could you leave it so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was in a hurry, looking for something for Norman. I&rsquo;ll set it to
      rights,&rdquo; said Ethel, gulping down her dislike of being reproved by Flora,
      with the thought that mamma would have said the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear!&rdquo; cried Flora presently, jumping up, &ldquo;what are you doing? piling
      up those heavy books on the top of the little ones; how do you think they
      will ever stand? let me do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, Flora;&rdquo; and Richard, in a low voice, gave Ethel some advice,
      which she received, seated on the floor, in a mood between temper and
      despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is going to teach her to do it on the principles of gravitation,&rdquo; said
      Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard did not do it himself, but, by his means, Ethel, without being in
      the least irritated, gave the chiffonier a thorough dusting and
      setting-to-rights, sorting magazines, burning old catalogues, and finding
      her own long-lost &lsquo;Undine&rsquo;, at which she was so delighted that she would
      have forgotten all; in proceeding to read it, curled up on the floor
      amongst the heaps of pamphlets, if another gentle hint from Richard had
      not made her finish her task so well, as to make Flora declare it was a
      pleasure to look in, and Harry pronounce it to be all neat and ship-shape.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no speaking to Margaret the next morning&mdash;it was French day&mdash;and
      Ethel had made strong resolutions to behave better; and whether there were
      fewer idioms, or that she was trying to understand, instead of carping at
      the master&rsquo;s explanations, they came to no battle; Flora led the
      conversation, and she sustained her part with credit, and gained an
      excellent mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora said afterwards to Margaret, &ldquo;I managed nicely for her. I would not
      let M. Ballompre blunder upon any of the subjects Ethel feels too deeply
      to talk of in good French, and really Ethel has a great talent for
      languages. How fast she gets on with Italian!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That she does,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;Suppose you send her up, Flora&mdash;you
      must want to go and draw or practice, and she may do her arithmetic here,
      or read to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the second time Margaret had made this proposal, and it did not
      please Flora, who had learned to think herself necessary to her sister,
      and liked to be the one to do everything for her. She was within six weeks
      of seventeen, and surely she need not be sent down again to the
      school-room, when she had been so good a manager of the whole family. She
      was fond of study and of accomplishments, but she thought she might be
      emancipated from Miss Winter; and it was not pleasant to her that a
      sister, only eighteen months older, and almost dependant on her, should
      have authority to dispose of her time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I practise in the evening,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I could draw here, if I
      wished, but I have some music to copy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret was concerned at the dissatisfaction, though not understanding
      the whole of it: &ldquo;You know, dear Flora,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I need not take up all
      your time now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t regret that,&rdquo; said Flora. &ldquo;I like nothing so well as waiting on
      you, and I can attend to my own affairs very well here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you why I proposed it,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;I think it would be a
      relief for Ethel to escape from Miss Winter&rsquo;s beloved Friday questions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great nonsense they are,&rdquo; said Flora. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you tell Miss Winter
      they are of no use?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma never interfered with them,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;She only kept Ethel in
      her own hands, and if you would be so kind as to change sometimes and sit
      in the school-room, we could spare Ethel, without hurting Miss Winter&rsquo;s
      feelings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll call Ethel, if you like, but I shall go and practise in the
      drawing-room. The old school-room piano is fit for nothing but Mary to
      hammer upon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flora went away, evidently annoyed, and Margaret&rsquo;s conjectures on the
      cause of it were cut short by Ethel running in with a slate in one hand
      and two books in the other, the rest having all tumbled down on the
      stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Margaret, I am so glad to come to you. Miss Winter has set Mary to
      read &lsquo;To be, or not to be,&rsquo; and it would have driven me distracted to have
      stayed there. I have got a most beautiful sum in Compound Proportion,
      about a lion, a wolf, and a bear eating up a carcase, and as soon as they
      have done it, you shall hear me say my ancient geography, and then we will
      do a nice bit of Tasso; and if we have any time after that, I have got
      such a thing to tell you&mdash;only I must not tell you now, or I shall go
      on talking and not finish my lessons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not till all were done, that Ethel felt free to exclaim, &ldquo;Now for
      what I have been longing to tell you&mdash;Richard is going to&mdash;&rdquo; But
      the fates were unpropitious. Aubrey trotted in, expecting to be amused;
      next came Norman, and Ethel gave up in despair; and, after having
      affronted Flora in the morning, Margaret was afraid of renewing the
      offence, by attempting to secure Ethel as her companion for the afternoon;
      so not till after the walk could Margaret contrive to claim the promised
      communication, telling Ethel to come and settle herself cosily by her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have been very glad of you last evening,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;for papa
      went to sleep, and my book was out of reach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am sorry; how I pity you, poor Margaret!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I have grown lazy,&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;for I don&rsquo;t mind those
      things now. I am never sorry for a quiet time to recollect and consider.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be like the waiting in the dark between the slides of a magic
      lantern,&rdquo; said Ethel; &ldquo;I never like to be quiet. I get so unhappy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad of resting and recollecting,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;It has all been
      so like a dream, that merry morning, and then, slowly waking to find
      myself here in dear mamma&rsquo;s place, and papa watching over me. Sometimes I
      think I have not half understood what it really is, and that I don&rsquo;t
      realise, that if I was up and about, I should find the house without her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; that is the aching part!&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;I am happy, sitting on her
      bed here with you. You are a little of her, besides being my own dear
      Peg-top! You are very lucky to miss the mealtimes and the evenings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the reason I don&rsquo;t feel it wrong to like to have papa sitting
      with me all the evening,&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;though it may make it worse for
      you to have him away. I don&rsquo;t think it selfish in me to keep him. He wants
      quiet so much, or to talk a little when it suits him; we are too many now,
      when he is tired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it is best,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;Nothing that you do is selfish&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      talk of it, dear Margaret. It will be something like old times when you
      come down again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But all this time you are not telling me what I want so much to hear,&rdquo;
       said Margaret, &ldquo;about Cocksmoor. I am so glad Richard has taken it up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That he has. We are to go every Friday, and hire a room, and teach the
      children. Once a week will do a great deal, if we can but make them wish
      to learn. It is a much better plan than mine; for if they care about it,
      they can come to school here on Sunday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is excellent,&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;and if he is at home till Easter, it
      will give it a start, and put you in the way of it, and get you through
      the short days and dark evenings, when you could not so well walk home
      without him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and then we can all teach; Flora, and Mary, and you, when you are
      well again. Richard says it will be disagreeable, but I don&rsquo;t think so&mdash;they
      are such unsophisticated people. That Granny Hall is such a funny old
      woman; and the whole place wants nothing but a little care, to do very
      well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must prepare for disappointments, dear Ethel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know; I know nothing is done without drawbacks; but I am so glad to
      make some beginning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So am I. Do you know, mamma and I were one day talking over those kind of
      things, and she said she had always regretted that she had so many duties
      at home, that she could not attend as much to the poor as she would like;
      but she hoped now we girls were growing up, we should be able to do more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she?&rdquo; was all Ethel said, but she was deeply gratified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been wanting to tell you. I knew you would like to hear it. It seems
      to set us to work so happily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only wish we could begin,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;but Richard is so slow! Of
      course we can&rsquo;t act without papa&rsquo;s consent and Mr. Wilmot&rsquo;s help, and he
      says papa must not be worried about it, he must watch for his own time to
      speak about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; said Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know&mdash;I would not have it otherwise; but what is tiresome is this.
      Richard is very good, but he is so dreadfully hard to stir up, and what&rsquo;s
      worse, so very much afraid of papa, that while he is thinking about
      opportunities, they will all go by, and then it will be Easter, and
      nothing done!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is not so much afraid of papa as he was,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;He has felt
      himself useful and a comfort, and papa is gentler; and that has cheered
      him out of the desponding way that kept him back from proposing anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Ethel; &ldquo;but I wish it was you. Can&rsquo;t you? you always know
      how to manage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; it is Richard&rsquo;s affair, and he must do as he thinks fit. Don&rsquo;t sigh,
      dear Ethel&mdash;perhaps he may soon speak, and, if not, you can be
      preparing in a quiet way all the time. Don&rsquo;t you remember how dear mamma
      used to tell us that things, hastily begun, never turn out well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this is not hasty. I&rsquo;ve been thinking about it these six weeks,&rdquo; said
      Ethel. &ldquo;If one does nothing but think, it is all no better than a vision.
      I want to be doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you can be doing&mdash;laying a sound foundation,&rdquo; said Margaret.
      &ldquo;The more you consider, and the wiser you make yourself, the better it
      will be when you do set to work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean by curing myself of my slovenly ways and impatient temper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I was exactly thinking of that,&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;but
      that ought to be the way. If we are not just the thing in our niche at
      home, I don&rsquo;t think we can do much real good elsewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be hollow, show-goodness,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;Yes, that is true; and
      it comes across me now, and then what a horrid wretch I am, to be wanting
      to undertake so much, when I leave so much undone. But, do you know,
      Margaret, there&rsquo;s no one such a help in those ways as Richard. Though he
      is so precise, he is never tiresome. He makes me see things, and do them
      neatly, without plaguing me, and putting me in a rage. I&rsquo;m not ready to
      bite off my own fingers, or kick all the rattle-traps over and leave them,
      as I am when Miss Winter scolds me, or nurse, or even Flora sometimes; but
      it is as if I was gratifying him, and his funny little old bachelor
      tidyisms divert me; besides, he teaches me the theory, and never lays hold
      of my poor fingers, and, when they won&rsquo;t bend the wrong way, calls them
      frogs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a capital master for you,&rdquo; said Margaret, much amused and pleased,
      for Richard was her especial darling, and she triumphed in any eulogy from
      those who ordinarily were too apt to regard his dullness with superior
      compassion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he would only read our books, and enter into poetry and delight in it;
      but it is all nonsense to him,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think how people can
      be so different; but, oh! here he comes. Ritchie, you should not come upon
      us before we are aware.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? I should have heard no good of myself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great good,&rdquo; said Margaret&mdash;&ldquo;she was telling me you would make a
      neat-handed woman of her in time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why she should not be as neat as other people,&rdquo; said Richard
      gravely. &ldquo;Has she been telling you our plan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And it was again happily discussed; Ethel, satisfied by finding him fully
      set upon the design, and Margaret giving cordial sympathy and counsel.
      When Ethel was called away, Margaret said, &ldquo;I am so glad you have taken it
      up, not only for the sake of Cocksmoor, but of Ethel. It is good for her
      not to spend her high soul in dreams.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid she does not know what she undertakes,&rdquo; said Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She does not; but you will keep her from being turned back. It is just
      the thing to prevent her energies from running to waste, and her being so
      much with you, and working under you, is exactly what one would have
      chosen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By contraries!&rdquo; said Richard, smiling. &ldquo;That is what I was afraid of. I
      don&rsquo;t half understand or follow her, and when I think a thing nonsense, I
      see you all calling it very fine, and I don&rsquo;t know what to make of it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are making yourself out more dull than you are,&rdquo; said Margaret
      affectionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know I am stupid, and seem tame and cold,&rdquo; said Richard, &ldquo;and you are
      the only one that does not care about it. That is what makes me wish
      Norman was the eldest. If I were as clever as he, I could do so much with
      Ethel, and be so much more to papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you would not. You would have other things in your head. You would
      not be the dear, dear old Ritchie that you are. You would not be a calm,
      cautious, steady balance to the quicksilver heads some of us have got. No,
      no, Norman&rsquo;s a very fine fellow, a very dear fellow, but he would not do
      half so well for our eldest&mdash;he is too easily up, and down again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I am getting into my old way of repining,&rdquo; said Richard. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      mind so much, since my father has at least one son to be proud of, and I
      can be of some use to him now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of the greatest, and to all of us. I am so glad you can stay after
      Christmas, and papa was pleased at your offering, and said he could not
      spare you at all, though he would have tried, if it had been any real
      advantage to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I hope he will approve. I must speak to him as soon as I can find
      him with his mind tolerably disengaged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The scene that ensued that evening in the magic lantern before Margaret&rsquo;s
      bed, did not promise much for the freedom of her father&rsquo;s mind. Harry
      entered with a resolute manner. &ldquo;Margaret, I wanted to speak to you,&rdquo; said
      he, spreading himself out, with an elbow on each arm of the chair. &ldquo;I want
      you to speak to papa about my going to sea. It is high time to see about
      it&mdash;I shall be thirteen on the fourth of May.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you mean it seriously, Harry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of course I do, really and truly; and if it is to come to pass, it
      is time to take measures. Don&rsquo;t you see, Margaret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is time, as you say,&rdquo; answered Margaret reflectingly, and sadly
      surveying the bright boy, rosy cheeked, round faced, and blue eyed, with
      the childish gladsomeness of countenance, that made it strange that his
      lot in life should be already in the balance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what you will all tell me, that it is a hard life, but I must get
      my own living some way or other, and I should like that way the best,&rdquo;
       said he earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Should you like to be always far from home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should come home sometimes, and bring such presents to Mary, and baby,
      and all of you; and I don&rsquo;t know what else to be, Margaret. I should hate
      to be a doctor&mdash;I can&rsquo;t abide sick people; and I couldn&rsquo;t write
      sermons, so I can&rsquo;t be a clergyman; and I won&rsquo;t be a lawyer, I vow, for
      Harvey Anderson is to be a lawyer&mdash;so there&rsquo;s nothing left but
      soldiers and sailors, and I mean to be a sailor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Harry, you may do your duty, and try to do right, if you are a
      sailor, and that is the point.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, I was sure you would not set your face against it, now you know Alan
      Ernescliffe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you were to be like him&mdash;&rdquo; Margaret found herself blushing, and
      broke off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you will ask papa about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better do so yourself. Boys had better settle such serious
      affairs with their fathers, without setting their sisters to interfere.
      What&rsquo;s the matter, Harry&mdash;you are not afraid to speak to papa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only for one thing,&rdquo; said Harry. &ldquo;Margaret, I went out to shoot pee-wits
      last Saturday with two fellows, and I can&rsquo;t speak to papa while that&rsquo;s on
      my mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you had better tell him at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew you would say so; but it would be like a girl, and it would be
      telling of the two fellows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all; papa would not care about them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said Harry, twisting a little, &ldquo;I knew I ought not; but they
      said I was afraid of a gun, and that I had no money. Now I see that was
      chaff, but I didn&rsquo;t then, and Norman wasn&rsquo;t there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so glad you have told me all this, Harry dear, for I knew you had
      been less at home of late, and I was almost afraid you were not going on
      quite well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what it is,&rdquo; said Harry. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stand things at all, and I can&rsquo;t
      go moping about as Norman does. I can&rsquo;t live without fun, and now Norman
      isn&rsquo;t here, half the time it turns to something I am sorry for
      afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Harry, if you let yourself be drawn into mischief here for want of
      Norman, what would you do at sea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be an officer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; said Margaret, smiling, &ldquo;that would not make much
      difference inside, though it might outside. You must get the self-control,
      and leave off being afraid to be said to be afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harry fidgeted. &ldquo;I should start fresh, and be out of the way of the
      Andersons,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That Anderson junior is a horrid fellow&mdash;he
      spites Norman, and he bullied me, till I was big enough to show him that
      it would not do&mdash;and though I am so much younger, he is afraid of me.
      He makes up to me, and tries to get me into all the mischief that is
      going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you know that, and let him lead you? Oh, Harry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t let him lead me,&rdquo; said Harry indignantly, &ldquo;but I won&rsquo;t have them
      say I can&rsquo;t do things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret laughed, and Harry presently perceived what she meant, but
      instead of answering, he began to boast, &ldquo;There never was a May in
      disgrace yet, and there never shall be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a thing to be very thankful for,&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;but you know
      there may be much harm without public disgrace. I never heard of one of
      the Andersons being in disgrace yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;shabby fellows, that just manage to keep fair with old Hoxton,
      and make a show,&rdquo; said Harry. &ldquo;They look at translations, and copy old
      stock verses. Oh, it was such fun the other day. What do you think? Norman
      must have been dreaming, for he had taken to school, by mistake, Richard&rsquo;s
      old Gradus that Ethel uses, and there were ever so many rough copies of
      hers sticking in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Ethel! What consternation she would be in! I hope no one found it
      out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Anderson junior was gaping about in despair for sense for his verses&mdash;he
      comes on that, and slyly copies a whole set of her old ones, done when she&mdash;Norman,
      I mean&mdash;was in the fifth form. His subject was a river, and hers
      Babylon; but, altering a line or two, it did just as well. He never
      guessed I saw him, and thought he had done it famously. He showed them up,
      and would have got some noted good mark, but that, by great good luck,
      Ethel had made two of her pentameters too short, which he hadn&rsquo;t the wit
      to find out, thinking all Norman did must be right. So he has shown up a
      girl&rsquo;s verses&mdash;isn&rsquo;t that rare?&rdquo; cried Harry, dancing on his chair
      with triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope no one knows they were hers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless you, no!&rdquo; said Harry, who regarded Ethel&rsquo;s attainments as something
      contraband. &ldquo;D&rsquo;ye think I could tell? No, that&rsquo;s the only pity, that he
      can&rsquo;t hear it; but, after all, I don&rsquo;t care for anything he does, now I
      know he has shown up a girl&rsquo;s verses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are these verses of poor Ethel&rsquo;s safe at home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I took care of that. Mind you don&rsquo;t tell anyone, Margaret; I never
      told even Norman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But all your school-fellows aren&rsquo;t like these? You have Hector
      Ernescliffe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a nice fellow enough, but he is little, and down in the school.
      &lsquo;Twould be making a fourth form of myself to be after him. The fact is,
      Margaret, they are a low, ungentlemanly lot just now, about sixth and
      upper fifth form,&rdquo; said Harry, lowering his voice into an anxious
      confidential tone; &ldquo;and since Norman has been less amongst them, they&rsquo;ve
      got worse; and you see, now home is different, and he isn&rsquo;t like what he
      was, I&rsquo;m thrown on them, and I want to get out of it. I didn&rsquo;t know that
      was it before, but Richard showed me what set me on thinking of it, and I
      see she knew all about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That she did! There is a great deal in what you say, Harry, but you know
      she thought nothing would be of real use but changing within. If you don&rsquo;t
      get a root of strength in yourself, your ship will be no better to you
      than school&mdash;there will be idle midshipmen as well as idle
      school-boys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; said Harry; &ldquo;but do you think papa will consent? She would
      not have minded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell. I should think he would; but if any scheme is to come to
      good, it must begin by your telling him of the going out shooting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harry sighed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have done it long ago if she was here,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
      never did anything so bad before without telling, and I don&rsquo;t like it at
      all. It seems to come between him and me when I wish him good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, Harry, pray do tell him. You&rsquo;ll have no comfort if you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know I shan&rsquo;t; but then he&rsquo;ll be so angry! And, do you know, Margaret,
      &lsquo;twas worse than I told you, for a covey of partridges got up, and
      unluckily I had got the gun, and I fired and killed one, and that was
      regular poaching, you know! And when we heard some one coming, how we did
      cut! Ax&mdash;the other fellow, I mean, got it, and cooked it in his
      bedroom, and ate it for supper; and he laughs about it, but I have felt so
      horrid all the week! Suppose a keeper had got a summons!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can only say again, the only peace will be in telling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but he will be so angry. When that lot of fellows a year or two ago
      did something like it, and shot some of the Abbotstoke rabbits, don&rsquo;t you
      remember how much he said about its being disgraceful, and ordering us
      never to have anything to do with their gunnery? And he will think it so
      very bad to have gone out on a lark just now! Oh, I wish I hadn&rsquo;t done
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So do I, indeed, Harry! but I am sure, even it he should be angry at
      first, he will be pleased with your confessing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harry looked very reluctant and disconsolate, and his sister did not
      wonder for Dr. May&rsquo;s way of hearing of a fault was never to be calculated
      on. &ldquo;Come, Harry,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;if he is ever so angry, though I don&rsquo;t think
      he will be, do you think that will be half as bad as this load at your
      heart? Besides, if you are not bold enough to speak to him, do you think
      you can ever be brave enough for a sailor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said Harry, and the words were hardly spoken, before his
      father&rsquo;s hand was on the door. He was taken by surprise at the moment of
      trial coming so speedily, and had half a mind to retreat by the other
      door; he was stayed by the reflection that Margaret would think him a
      coward, unfit for a sailor, and he made up his mind to endure whatever
      might betide.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harry here? This is company I did not expect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harry has something to say to you, papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! my boy, what is it?&rdquo; said he kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa, I have killed a partridge. Two fellows got me to hire a gun, and go
      out shooting with them last Saturday,&rdquo; said Harry, speaking firmly and
      boldly now he had once begun. &ldquo;We meant only to go after pee-wits, but a
      partridge got up, and I killed it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then came a pause. Harry stopped, and Dr. May waited, half expecting to
      hear that the boy was only brought to confession by finding himself in a
      scrape. Margaret spoke. &ldquo;And he could not be happy till he had told you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it so? Is that the whole?&rdquo; said the doctor, looking at his son with a
      keen glance, between affection and inquiry, as if only waiting to be sure
      the confession was free, before he gave his free forgiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, papa,&rdquo; said Harry, his voice and lip losing their firmness, as the
      sweetness of expression gained the day on his father&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Only that I
      know&mdash;&lsquo;twas very wrong&mdash;especially now&mdash;and I am very sorry&mdash;and
      I beg your pardon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The latter words came between sighs, fast becoming sobs, in spite of
      Harry&rsquo;s attempts to control them, as his father held out his arm, and drew
      him close to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s mamma&rsquo;s own brave boy,&rdquo; he said in his ear&mdash;in a voice which
      strong feeling had reduced to such a whisper, that even Margaret could not
      hear&mdash;she only saw how Harry, sobbing aloud, clung tighter and
      tighter to him, till he said &ldquo;Take care of my arm!&rdquo; and Harry sprang back
      at least a yard, with such a look of dismay, that the doctor laughed. &ldquo;No
      harm done!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I was only a little in dread of such a young lion!
      Comeback, Harry,&rdquo; and he took his hand. &ldquo;It was a bad piece of work, and
      it will never do for you to let yourself be drawn into every bit of
      mischief that is on foot; I believe I ought to give you a good lecture on
      it, but I can&rsquo;t do it, after such a straightforward confession. You must
      have gone through enough in the last week, not to be likely to do it
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, papa&mdash;thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I must not ask you any questions about it, for fear of
      betraying the fellows,&rdquo; said Dr. May, half smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, papa,&rdquo; said Harry, infinitely relieved and grateful, and quite
      content for some space to lean in silence against the chair, with that
      encircling arm round him, while some talk passed between his father and
      Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a world of thought passed through the boy&rsquo;s young soul in that space!
      First, there was a thrill of intense, burning love to his father, scarcely
      less fondness to his sweet motherly sister; a clinging feeling to every
      chair and table of that room, which seemed still full of his mother&rsquo;s
      presence; a numbering over of all the others with ardent attachment, and a
      flinging from him with horror the notion of asking to be far away from
      that dearest father, that loving home, that arm that was round him.
      Anything rather than be without them in the dreary world! But then came
      the remembrance of cherished visions, the shame of relinquishing a settled
      purpose, the thought of weary morrows, with the tempters among his
      playmates, and his home blank and melancholy; and the roaming spirit of
      enterprise stirred again, and reproached him with being a baby, for
      fancying he could stay at home for ever. He would come back again with
      such honours as Alan Ernescliffe had brought, and oh! if his father so
      prized them in a stranger, what would it be in his own son? Come home to
      such a greeting as would make up for the parting! Harry&rsquo;s heart throbbed
      again for the boundless sea, the tall ship, and the wondrous foreign
      climes, where he had so often lived in fancy. Should he, could he speak:
      was this the moment? and he stood gazing at the fire, oppressed with the
      weighty reality of deciding his destiny. At last Dr. May looked in his
      face, &ldquo;Well, what now, boy? You have your head full of something&mdash;what&rsquo;s
      coming next?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Out it came, &ldquo;Papa will you let me be a sailor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Dr. May, &ldquo;that is come on again, is it? I thought that you had
      forgotten all that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, papa,&rdquo; said Harry, with the manly coolness that the sense of his
      determination gave him&mdash;&ldquo;it was not a mere fancy, and I have never
      had it out of my head. I mean it quite in earnest&mdash;I had rather be a
      sailor. I don&rsquo;t wish to get away from Latin and Greek, I don&rsquo;t mind them;
      but I think I could be a better sailor than anything. I know it is not all
      play, but I am willing to rough it; and I am getting so old, it is time to
      see about it, so will you consent to it, papa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! there&rsquo;s some sense in your way of putting it,&rdquo; said Dr. May. &ldquo;You
      have it strong in your head then, and you know &lsquo;tis not all fair-weather
      work!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I do; Alan told me histories, and I&rsquo;ve read all about it; but one
      must rough it anywhere, and if I am ever so far away, I&rsquo;ll try not to
      forget what&rsquo;s right. I&rsquo;ll do my duty, and not care for danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well said, my man; but remember &lsquo;tis easier talking by one&rsquo;s own fireside
      than doing when the trial comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And will you let me, papa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll think about it. I can&rsquo;t make up my mind as &lsquo;quick as directly,&rsquo; you
      know, Harry,&rdquo; said his father, smiling kindly, &ldquo;but I won&rsquo;t treat it as a
      boy&rsquo;s fancy, for you&rsquo;ve spoken in a manly way, and deserve to be attended
      to. Now run down, and tell the girls to put away their work, for I shall
      come down in a minute to read prayers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harry went, and his father sighed and mused! &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fine fellow! So
      this is what comes of bringing sick sailors home&mdash;one&rsquo;s own boys must
      be catching the infection. Little monkey, he talks as wisely as if he were
      forty! He is really set on it, do you think, Margaret? I&rsquo;m afraid so!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; said Margaret; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he ever has it out of his
      mind!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when the roving spirit once lays hold of a lad, he must have his way&mdash;he
      is good for nothing else,&rdquo; said Dr. May.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose a man may keep from evil in that profession as well as in any
      other,&rdquo; said Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aha! you are bit too, are you?&rdquo; said the doctor; &ldquo;&lsquo;tis the husbandman and
      viper, is it?&rdquo; Then his smile turned into a heavy sigh, as he saw he had
      brought colour to Margaret&rsquo;s pale cheek, but she answered calmly, &ldquo;Dear
      mamma did not think it would be a bad thing for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said the doctor, pausing; &ldquo;but it never came to this with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish he had chosen something else; but&mdash;&rdquo; and Margaret thought it
      right to lay before her father some part of what he had said of the
      temptations of the school at Stoneborough. The doctor listened and
      considered at last he rose, and said, &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll set Ritchie to write to
      Ernescliffe, and hear what he says. What must be, must be. &lsquo;Tis only
      asking me to give up the boy, that&rsquo;s all;&rdquo; and as he left the room, his
      daughter again heard his sigh and half-uttered words, &ldquo;Oh, Maggie,
      Maggie!&rdquo;

<pre xml:space="preserve">
                                   A tale
     Would rouse adventurous courage in a boy,
     And make him long to be a mariner,
     That he might rove the main.&mdash;SOUTHEY.
</pre>
    <p>
      Etheldred had the satisfaction of seeing the Taylors at school on Sunday,
      but no Halls made their appearance, and, on inquiry, she was told, &ldquo;Please
      ma&rsquo;am, they said they would not come;&rdquo; so Ethel condemned Granny Hall as
      &ldquo;a horrid, vile, false, hypocritical old creature! It was no use having
      anything more to do with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Richard; &ldquo;then I need not speak to my father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ritchie now! you know I meant no such thing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, it is just what will happen continually.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course there will be failures, but this is so abominable, when they
      had those nice frocks, and those two beautiful eighteen-penny shawls!
      There are three shillings out of my pound thrown away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps there was some reason to prevent them. We will go and see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall only hear some more palavering. I want to have no more to say to&mdash;&rdquo;
       but here Ethel caught herself up, and began to perceive what a happiness
      it was that she had not the power of acting on her own impulses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The twins and their little brother of two years old were christened in the
      afternoon, and Flora invited the parents to drink tea in the kitchen, and
      visit Lucy, while Ethel and Mary each carried a baby upstairs to exhibit
      to Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard, in the meantime, had a conversation with John Taylor, and learned
      a good deal about the district, and the number of the people. At tea, he
      began to rehearse his information, and the doctor listened with interest,
      which put Ethel in happy agitation, believing that the moment was come,
      and Richard seemed to be only waiting for the conclusion of a long tirade
      against those who ought to do something for the place, when behold!
      Blanche was climbing on her father&rsquo;s knee, begging for one of his Sunday
      stories.
    </p>
    <p>
      Etheldred was cruelly disappointed, and could not at first rejoice to see
      her father able again to occupy himself with his little girl. The
      narration, in his low tones, roused her from her mood of vexation. It was
      the story of David, which he told in language scriptural and poetical, so
      pretty and tender in its simplicity, that she could not choose but attend.
      Ever and anon there was a glance towards Harry, as if he were secretly
      likening his own &ldquo;yellow-haired laddie&rdquo; to the &ldquo;shepherd boy, ruddy, and
      of a fair countenance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So Tom and Blanche,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;can you tell me how we may be like
      the shepherd-boy, David?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There aren&rsquo;t giants now,&rdquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wrong is a giant,&rdquo; said his little sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right, my white May-flower, and what then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are to fight,&rdquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and mind, the giant with all his armour may be some great thing we
      have to do: but what did David begin with when he was younger?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lion and the bear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, and minding his sheep. Perhaps little things, now you are little
      children, may be like the lion and the bear&mdash;so kill them off&mdash;get
      rid of them&mdash;cure yourself of whining or dawdling, or whatever it be,
      and mind your sheep well,&rdquo; said he, smiling sweetly in answer to the
      children&rsquo;s earnest looks as they caught his meaning, &ldquo;and if you do, you
      will not find it near so hard to deal with your great giant struggle when
      it comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ah! thought Ethel, it suits me as well as the children. I have a great
      giant on Cocksmoor, and here I am, not allowed to attack him, because,
      perhaps, I am not minding my sheep, and letting my lion and my bear run
      loose about the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was less impatient this week, partly from the sense of being on
      probation, and partly because she, in common with all the rest, was much
      engrossed with Harry&rsquo;s fate. He came home every day at dinner-time with
      Norman to ask if Alan Ernescliffe&rsquo;s letter had come; and at length Mary
      and Tom met them open-mouthed with the news that Margaret had it in her
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thither they hastened. Margaret held it out with a smile of
      congratulation. &ldquo;Here it is, Harry; papa said you were to have it, and
      consider it well, and let him know, when you had taken time. You must do
      it soberly. It is once for all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harry&rsquo;s impetuosity was checked, and he took the letter quietly. His
      sister put her hand on his shoulder, &ldquo;Would you mind my kissing you, dear
      Harry?&rdquo; and as he threw his arms round her neck, she whispered, &ldquo;Pray that
      you may choose right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went quietly away, and Norman begged to know what had been Alan
      Ernescliffe&rsquo;s advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can scarcely say he gave any direct advice,&rdquo; said Margaret; &ldquo;He would
      not have thought that called for. He said, no doubt there were hardships
      and temptations, more or less, according to circumstances; but weighing
      one thing with another, he thought it gave as fair a chance of happiness
      as other professions, and the discipline and regularity had been very good
      for himself, as well as for many others he had known. He said, when a man
      is willing to go wrong there is much to help him, but when he is resolved
      on doing right, he need not be prevented.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what you may say of anything,&rdquo; said Norman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so; and it answered papa&rsquo;s question, whether it was exposing Harry
      to more temptation than he must meet with anywhere. That was the reason it
      was such a comfort to have anyone to write to, who understands it so
      well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and knows Harry&rsquo;s nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said he had been fortunate in his captains, and had led, on the whole,
      a happy life at sea; and he thought if it was so with him, Harry was
      likely to enjoy it more, being of a hardy adventurous nature, and a sailor
      from choice, not from circumstances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he advised for it? I did not think he would; you know he will not
      let Hector be a sailor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He told me he thought only a strong natural bent that way made it
      desirable, and that he believed Hector only wished it from imitation of
      him. He said too, long ago, that he thought Harry cut out for a sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A spirited fellow!&rdquo; said Norman, with a look of saddened pride and
      approval, not at all like one so near the same age. &ldquo;He is up to anything,
      afraid of nothing, he can lick any boy in the school already. It will be
      worse than ever without him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you will miss your constant follower. He has been your shadow ever
      since he could walk. But there&rsquo;s the clock, I must not keep you any
      longer; good-bye, Norman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harry gave his brother the letter as soon as they were outside the house,
      and, while he read it, took his arm and guided him. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Norman as
      he finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all right,&rdquo; said Harry; and the two brothers said no more; there
      was something rising up in their throats at the thought that they had very
      few more walks to take together to Bishop Whichcote&rsquo;s school; Norman&rsquo;s
      heart was very full at the prospect of another vacancy in his home, and
      Harry&rsquo;s was swelling between the ardour of enterprise and the thought of
      bidding good-bye to each familiar object, and, above all, to the brother
      who had been his model and admiration from babyhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;June!&rdquo; at length he broke out, &ldquo;I wish you were going too. I should not
      mind it half so much if you were.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, Harry! you want to be July after June all your life, do you?
      You&rsquo;ll be much more of a man without me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That evening Dr. May called Harry into his study to ask him if his mind
      was made up; he put the subject fairly before him, and told him not to be
      deterred from choosing what he thought would be for the best by any
      scruples about changing his mind. &ldquo;We shall not think a bit the worse of
      you; better now, than too late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was that in his face and tone that caused Harry to say, in a stifled
      voice, &ldquo;I did not think you would care so much, papa; I won&rsquo;t go, if you
      do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. May put his hand on his shoulder, and was silent. Harry felt a strange
      mixture of hope and fear, joy and grief, disappointment and relief. &ldquo;You
      must not give it up on that account, my dear,&rdquo; he said at length; &ldquo;I
      should not let you see this, if it did not happen at a time when I can&rsquo;t
      command myself as I ought. If you were an only son, it might be your duty
      to stay; being one of many, &lsquo;tis nonsense to make a rout about parting
      with you. If it is better for you, it is better for all of us; and we
      shall do very well when you are once fairly gone. Don&rsquo;t let that influence
      you for a moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harry paused, not that he doubted, but he was collecting his energies&mdash;&ldquo;Then,
      papa, I choose the navy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it is done, Harry. You have chosen in a dutiful, unselfish spirit,
      and I trust it will prosper with you; for I am sure your father&rsquo;s blessing&mdash;aye,
      and your mother&rsquo;s too, go with you! Now then,&rdquo; after a pause, &ldquo;go and call
      Richard. I want him to write to Ernescliffe about that naval school. You
      must take your leave of the Whichcote foundation on Friday. I shall go and
      give Dr. Hoxton notice tomorrow, and get Tom&rsquo;s name down instead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And when the name of Thomas May was set down, Dr. Hoxton expressed his
      trust that it would pass through the school as free from the slightest
      blemish as those of Richard, Norman, and Harry May.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that Harry&rsquo;s destiny was fixed, Ethel began to think of Cocksmoor
      again, and she accomplished another walk there with Richard, Flora, and
      Mary, to question Granny Hall about the children&rsquo;s failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old woman&rsquo;s reply was a tissue of contradictions: the girls were idle
      hussies, all contrary: they plagued the very life out of her, and she
      represented herself as using the most frightful threats, if they would not
      go to school. Breaking every bone in their skin was the least injury she
      promised them; till Mary, beginning to think her a cruel old woman, took
      hold of her brother&rsquo;s coat-tails for protection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am afraid, Mrs. Hall,&rdquo; said Richard, in that tone which might be
      either ironical or simple, &ldquo;if you served them so, they would never be
      able to get to school at all, poor things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless you, sir, d&rsquo;ye think I&rsquo;d ever lay a finger near them; it&rsquo;s only the
      way one must talk to children, you see,&rdquo; said she, patronising his
      inexperience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps they have found that out,&rdquo; said Richard. Granny looked much
      entertained, and laughed triumphantly and shrewdly, &ldquo;ay, ay, that they
      have, the lasses&mdash;they be sharp enough for anything, that they be.
      Why, when I tell little Jenny that there&rsquo;s the black man coming after her,
      what does she do but she ups and says, &lsquo;Granny, I know &lsquo;tis only the wind
      in the chimney.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I don&rsquo;t think it seems to answer,&rdquo; said Richard. &ldquo;Just suppose you
      were to try for once, really punishing them when they won&rsquo;t obey you,
      perhaps they would do it next time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, sir, you see I don&rsquo;t like to take the stick to them; they&rsquo;ve got no
      mother, you see, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary thought her a kind grandmother, and came out from behind her brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it would be kinder to do it for once. What do you think they will
      do as they grow older, if you don&rsquo;t keep them in order when they are
      little?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was foresight beyond Granny Hall, who began to expatiate on the
      troubles she had undergone in their service, and the excellence of Sam.
      There was certainly a charm in her manners, for Ethel forgot her charge of
      ingratitude, the other sisters were perfectly taken with her, nor could
      they any of them help giving credence to her asseverations that Jenny and
      Polly should come to school next Sunday.
    </p>
    <p>
      They soon formed another acquaintance; a sharp-faced woman stood in their
      path, with a little girl in her hand, and arrested them with a low
      curtsey, and not a very pleasant voice, addressing herself to Flora, who
      was quite as tall as Richard, and appeared the person of most consequence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you please, miss, I wanted to speak to you. I have got a little girl
      here, and I want to send her to school, only I have no shoes for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, surely, if she can run about here on the heath, she can go to
      school,&rdquo; said Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! but there is all the other children to point at her. The poor thing
      would be daunted, you see, miss; if I could but get some friend to give
      her a pair of shoes, I&rsquo;d send her in a minute. I want her to get some
      learning; as I am always saying, I&rsquo;d never keep her away, if I had but got
      the clothes to send her in. I never lets her be running on the common,
      like them Halls, as it&rsquo;s a shame to see them in nice frocks, as Mrs. Hall
      got by going hypercriting about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; said Richard, cutting her short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Watts, if you please, sir; we heard there was good work up here, sir, and
      so we came; but I&rsquo;d never have set foot in it if I had known what a dark
      heathenish place it is, with never a Gospel minister to come near it,&rdquo; and
      a great deal more to the same purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary whispered to Flora something about having outgrown her boots, but
      Flora silenced her by a squeeze of the hand, and the two friends of
      Cocksmoor felt a good deal puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Flora said, &ldquo;You will soon get her clothed if she comes regularly
      to school on Sundays, for she will be admitted into the club; I will
      recommend her if she has a good character and comes regularly.
      Good-morning, Mrs. Watts. Now we must go, or it will be dark before we get
      home.&rdquo; And they walked hastily away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Horrid woman!&rdquo; was Ethel&rsquo;s exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Flora,&rdquo; said innocent Mary, &ldquo;why would you not let me give the little
      girl my boots?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I may, if she is good and comes to school, said Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think Margaret ought to settle what you do with your boots,&rdquo; said
      Richard, not much to Flora&rsquo;s satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the same,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If I approve, Margaret will not object.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How well you helped us out, Flora,&rdquo; said Ethel; &ldquo;I did not know in the
      least what to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be the best way of testing her sincerity, said Flora; and at
      least it will do the child good; but I congratulate you on the promising
      aspect of Cocksmoor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We did not expect to find a perfect place,&rdquo; said Ethel; &ldquo;if it were, it
      would be of no use to go to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel could answer with dignity, but her heart sank at the aspect of what
      she had undertaken. She knew there would be evil, but she had expected it
      in a more striking and less disagreeable form.
    </p>
    <p>
      That walk certainly made her less impatient, though it did not relax her
      determination, nor the guard over her lion and bear, which her own good
      feeling, aided by Margaret&rsquo;s council, showed her were the greatest
      hindrances to her doing anything good and great.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though she was obliged to set to work so many principles and reflections
      to induce herself to wipe a pen, or to sit straight on her chair, that it
      was like winding up a steam-engine to thread a needle; yet the work was
      being done&mdash;she was struggling with her faults, humbled by them,
      watching them, and overcoming them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora, meanwhile, was sitting calmly down in the contemplation of the
      unexpected services she had rendered, confident that her character for
      energy and excellence was established, believing it herself, and looking
      back on her childish vanity and love of domineering as long past and
      conquered. She thought her grown-up character had begun, and was too
      secure to examine it closely.

      CHAPTER XI.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     One thing is wanting in the beamy cup
       Of my young life! one thing to be poured in;
     Ay, and one thing is wanting to fill up
       The measure of proud joy, and make it sin.&mdash;F. W. F.
</pre>
    <p>
      Hopes that Dr. May would ever have his mind free, seemed as fallacious as
      mamma&rsquo;s old promise to Margaret, to make doll&rsquo;s clothes for her whenever
      there should be no live dolls to be worked for in the nursery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard and Ethel themselves had their thoughts otherwise engrossed. The
      last week before the holidays was an important one. There was an
      examination, by which the standing of the boys in the school was
      determined, and this time it was of more than ordinary importance, as the
      Randall scholarship of £100 a year for three years would be open in the
      summer to the competition of the first six boys. Richard had never come
      within six of the top, but had been past at every examination by younger
      boys, till his father could bear it no longer; and now Norman was too
      young to be likely to have much chance of being of the number. There were
      eight decidedly his seniors, and Harvey Anderson, a small, quick-witted
      boy, half a year older, who had entered school at the same time, and had
      always been one step below him, had, in the last three months, gained fast
      upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry, however, meant Norman to be one of the six, and declared all the
      fellows thought he would be, except Andersen&rsquo;s party. Mr. Wilmot, in a
      call on Ethel and Flora, told them that he thought their brother had a
      fair chance, but he feared he was over-working himself, and should tell
      the doctor so, whenever he could catch him; but this was difficult, as
      there was a great deal of illness just then, and he was less at home than
      usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this excited the home party, but Norman only seemed annoyed by talk
      about it, and though always with a book in his hand, was so dreamy and
      listless, that Flora declared that there was no fear of his doing too much&mdash;she
      thought he would fail for want of trying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean to try,&rdquo; said Norman; &ldquo;say no more about it, pray.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The great day was the 20th of December, and Ethel ran out, as the boys
      went to school, to judge of Norman&rsquo;s looks, which were not promising. &ldquo;No
      wonder,&rdquo; said Harry, since he had stayed up doing Euripides and Cicero the
      whole length of a candle that had been new at bedtime. &ldquo;But never mind,
      Ethel, if he only beats Anderson, I don&rsquo;t care for anything else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it will be unbearable if he does not! Do try, Norman, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never you mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll light up at the last moment,&rdquo; said Ethel, consolingly, to Harry;
      but she was very uneasy herself, for she had set her heart on his
      surpassing Harvey Anderson. No more was heard all day. Tom went at
      dinner-time to see if he could pick up any news; but he was shy, or was
      too late, and gained no intelligence. Dr. May and Richard talked of going
      to hear the speeches and viva voce examination in the afternoon&mdash;objects
      of great interest to all Stoneborough men&mdash;but just as they came home
      from a long day&rsquo;s work, Dr. May was summoned to the next town, by an
      electric telegraph, and, as it was to a bad case, he did not expect to be
      at home till the mail-train came in at one o&rsquo;clock at night. Richard
      begged to go with him, and he consented, unwillingly, to please Margaret,
      who could not bear to think of his &ldquo;fending for himself&rdquo; in the dark on
      the rail-road.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very long did the evening seem to the listening sisters. Eight, and no
      tidings; nine, the boys not come; Tom obliged to go to bed by sheer
      sleepiness, and Ethel unable to sit still, and causing Flora demurely to
      wonder at her fidgeting so much, it would be so much better to fix her
      attention to some employment; while Margaret owned that Flora was right,
      but watched, and started at each sound, almost as anxiously as Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was ten, when there was a sharp pull at the bell, and down flew the
      sisters; but old James was beforehand, and Harry was exclaiming, &ldquo;Dux!
      James, he is Dux! Hurrah! Flossy, Ethel, Mary! There stands the Dux of
      Stoneborough! Where&rsquo;s papa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sent for to Whitford. But oh! Norman, Dux! Is he really?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure, but I must tell Margaret,&rdquo; and up he rushed, shouted the news
      to her, but could not stay for congratulation; broke Tom&rsquo;s slumber by
      roaring it in his ear, and dashed into the nursery, where nurse for once
      forgave him for waking the baby. Norman, meanwhile, followed his eager
      sisters into the drawing-room, putting up his hand as if the light dazzled
      him, and looking, by no means, as it he had just achieved triumphant
      success.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel paused in her exultation: &ldquo;But is it, is it true, Norman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said wearily, making his way to his dark corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what was it for? How is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; said Flora. &ldquo;Are you tired, Norman, dear, does your
      head ache?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes;&rdquo; and the pain was evidently severe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come to Margaret?&rdquo; said Ethel, knowing what was the greater
      suffering; but he did not move, and they forbore to torment him with
      questions. The next moment Harry came down in an ecstacy, bringing in,
      from the hall, Norman&rsquo;s beautiful prize books, and showing off their Latin
      inscription.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said he, looking at his brother, &ldquo;he is regularly done for. He ought
      to turn in at once. That Everard is a famous fellow for an examiner. He
      said he never had seen such a copy of verses sent up by a school-boy, and
      could hardly believe June was barely sixteen. Old Hoxton says he is the
      youngest Dux they have had these fifty years that he has known the school,
      and Mr. Wilmot said &lsquo;twas the most creditable examination he had ever
      known, and that I might tell papa so. What did possess that ridiculous old
      landlubber at Whitford, to go and get on the sick-list on this, of all the
      nights of the year? June, how can you go on sitting there, when you know
      you ought to be in your berth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish he was,&rdquo; said Flora, &ldquo;but let him have some tea first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And tell us more, Harry,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;Oh! it is famous! I knew he would
      come right at last. It is too delightful, if papa was but here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it? You should have seen how Anderson grinned&mdash;he is only
      fourth&mdash;down below Forder, and Cheviot, and Ashe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I did not think Norman would have been before Forder and Cheviot.
      That is grand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the verses that did it,&rdquo; said Harry; &ldquo;they had an hour to do
      Themistocles on the hearth of Admetus, and there he beat them all to
      shivers. &lsquo;Twas all done smack, smooth, without a scratch, in Alcaics, and
      Cheviot heard Wilmot saying, &lsquo;twas no mere task, but had poetry, and all
      that sort of thing in it. But I don&rsquo;t know whether that would have done,
      if he had not come out so strong in the recitation; they put him on in
      Priam&rsquo;s speech to Achilles, and he said it&mdash;Oh it was too bad papa
      did not hear him! Every one held their breath and listened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How you do go on!&rdquo; muttered Norman; but no one heeded, and Harry
      continued. &ldquo;He construed a chorus in Sophocles without a blunder, but what
      did the business was this, I believe. They asked all manner of
      out-of-the-way questions&mdash;history and geography, what no one
      expected, and the fellows who read nothing they can help, were thoroughly
      posed. Forder had not a word to say, and the others were worse, for
      Cheviot thought Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s Earl of Leicester was Simon de Montfort;
      and didn&rsquo;t know when that battle was, beginning with an E.&mdash;was it
      Evesham, or Edgehill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Harry, you are as bad yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But any one would know Leicester, because of Kenilworth,&rdquo; said Harry;
      &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m not sixth form. If papa had but been there! Every one was asking
      for him, and wishing it. For Dr. Hoxton called me&mdash;they shook hands
      with me, and wished me joy of it, and told me to tell my father how well
      Norman had done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you looked so happy, they could not help it,&rdquo; said Flora,
      smiling at that honest beaming face of joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said Norman, looking up; &ldquo;they had something to say to him on his
      own score, which he has forgotten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think not,&rdquo; said Harry. &ldquo;Why, what d&rsquo;ye think they said? That I
      had gone on as well as all the Mays, and they trusted I should still, and
      be a credit to my profession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Harry! why didn&rsquo;t you tell us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! that is grand!&rdquo; and, as the two elder girls made this exclamation,
      Mary proceeded to a rapturous embrace. &ldquo;Get along, Mary, you are
      throttling one. Mr. Everard inquired for my father and Margaret, and said
      he&rsquo;d call to-morrow, and Hoxton and Wilmot kept on wishing he was there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish he had been!&rdquo; said Ethel; &ldquo;he would have taken such delight in it;
      but, even if he could have gone, he doubted whether it would not have made
      Norman get on worse from anxiety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Cheviot wanted me to send up for him at dinner-time,&rdquo; said Harry;
      &ldquo;for as soon as we sat down in the hall, June turned off giddy, and could
      not stay, and looked so horrid, we thought it was all over with him, and
      he would not be able to go up at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Cheviot thought you ought to send for papa!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I knew he would not be in, and so we left him lying down on the
      bench in the cloister till dinner was over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a place for catching cold!&rdquo; said Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So Cheviot said, but I couldn&rsquo;t help it; and when we went to call him
      afterwards, he was all right. Wasn&rsquo;t it fun, when the names were called
      over, and May senior at the head! I don&rsquo;t think it will be better when I
      am a post-captain myself! But Margaret has not heard half yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After telling it once in her room, once in the nursery, in whispers like
      gusts of wind, and once in the pantry, Harry employed himself in writing&mdash;&ldquo;Norman
      is Dux!&rdquo; in immense letters, on pieces of paper, which he disposed all
      over the house, to meet the eyes of his father and Richard on their
      return.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel&rsquo;s joy was sadly damped by Norman&rsquo;s manner. He hardly spoke&mdash;only
      just came in to wish Margaret good-night, and shrank from her affectionate
      sayings, departing abruptly to his own room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor fellow! he is sadly overdone,&rdquo; said she, as he went.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; sighed Ethel, nearly ready to cry, &ldquo;&lsquo;tis not like what I used to
      fancy it would be when he came to the head of the school!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be different to-morrow,&rdquo; said Margaret, trying to console herself
      as well as Ethel. &ldquo;Think how he has been on the strain this whole day, and
      long before, doing so much more than older boys. No wonder he is tired and
      worn out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel did not understand what mental fatigue was, for her active, vigorous
      spirit had never been tasked beyond its powers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope he will be like himself to-morrow!&rdquo; said she disconsolately. &ldquo;I
      never saw him rough and hasty before. It was even with you, Margaret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, Ethel you aren&rsquo;t going to blame your own Norman for unkindness on
      this of all days in the year. You know how it was; you love him better;
      just as I do, for not being able to bear to stay in this room, where&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ethel, mournfully; &ldquo;it was a great shame of me! How could I?
      Dear Norman! how he does grieve&mdash;what love his must have been! But
      yet, Margaret,&rdquo; she said impatiently, and the hot tears breaking out, &ldquo;I
      cannot&mdash;cannot bear it! To have him not caring one bit for all of us!
      I want him to triumph! I can&rsquo;t without him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, Ethel, you, who said you didn&rsquo;t care for mere distinction and
      praise? Don&rsquo;t you think dear mamma would say it was safer for him not to
      be delighted and triumphant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very tiresome,&rdquo; said Ethel, nearly convinced, but in a slightly
      petulant voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And does not one love those two dear boys to-night!&rdquo; said Margaret.
      &ldquo;Norman not able to rejoice in his victory without her, and Harry in such
      an ecstacy with Norman&rsquo;s honours. I don&rsquo;t think I ever was so fond of my
      two brothers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel smiled, and drew up her head, and said no boys were like them
      anywhere, and papa would be delighted, and so went to bed happier in her
      exultation, and in hoping that the holidays would make Norman himself
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing could be better news for Dr. May, who had never lost a grain of
      the ancient school-party-loyalty that is part of the nature of the English
      gentleman. He was a thorough Stoneborough boy, had followed the politics
      of the Whichcote foundation year by year all his life, and perhaps, in his
      heart, regarded no honour as more to be prized than that of Dux and
      Randall scholar. Harry was in his room the next morning as soon as ever he
      was stirring, a welcome guest&mdash;teased a little at first, by his
      pretending to take it all as a sailor&rsquo;s prank to hoax him and Richard, and
      then free to pour out to delighted ears the whole history of the
      examination, and of every one&rsquo;s congratulations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norman himself was asleep when Harry went to give this narration. He came
      down late, and his father rose to meet him as he entered. &ldquo;My boy,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;I had not expected this of you. Well done, Norman!&rdquo; and the whole
      tone and gesture had a heartfelt approval and joy in them, that Ethel knew
      her brother was deeply thrilled by, for his colour deepened, and his lips
      quivered into something like a smile, though he did not lift his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came Richard&rsquo;s warm greeting and congratulation, he, too, showing
      himself as delighted as if the honours were his own; and then Dr. May
      again, in lively tones, like old times, laughing at Norman for sleeping
      late, and still not looking well awake, asking him if he was quite sure it
      was not all a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Norman, &ldquo;I should think it was, if it were not that you all
      believe it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harry had better go to sleep next,&rdquo; said Dr. May, &ldquo;and see what dreaming
      will make him. If it makes Dux of Norman, who knows but it may make Drakes
      of him? Ha! Ethel&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       &ldquo;Oh, give us for our Kings such Queens,
          And for our Ducks such Drakes.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      There had not been such a merry breakfast for months. There was the old
      confusion of voices; the boys, Richard, and the doctor had much to talk
      over of the school doings of this week, and there was nearly as much
      laughing as in days past. Ethel wondered whether any one but herself
      observed that the voice most seldom heard was Norman&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      The promised call was made by Dr. Hoxton, and Mr. Everard, an old friend,
      and after their departure Dr. May came to Margaret&rsquo;s room with fresh
      accounts, corroborating what Harry had said of the clear knowledge and
      brilliant talent that Norman had displayed, to a degree that surprised his
      masters, almost as much as the examiners. The copy of verses Dr. May
      brought with him, and construed them to Margaret, commenting all the way
      on their ease, and the fullness of thought, certainly remarkable in a boy
      of sixteen.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were then resigned to Ethel&rsquo;s keeping, and she could not help
      imparting her admiration to their author, with some apology for vexing him
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be cross,&rdquo; said Norman, whom these words roused to a
      sense that he had been churlish last night; &ldquo;but I cannot help it. I wish
      people would not make such a fuss about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you can be well, Norman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense. There&rsquo;s nothing the matter with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t understand your not caring at all, and not being the least
      pleased.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It only makes it worse,&rdquo; said Norman; &ldquo;I only feel as if I wanted to be
      out of the way. My only comfortable time yesterday was on that bench in
      the cool quiet cloister. I don&rsquo;t think I could have got through without
      that, when they left me in peace, till Cheviot and Harry came to rout me
      up, and I knew it was all coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you have overworked yourself, but it was for something. You have
      given papa such pleasure and comfort, as you can&rsquo;t help being glad of.
      That is very different from us foolish young ones and our trumpeting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What comfort can it be? I&rsquo;ve not been the smallest use all this time.
      When he was ill, I left him to Ernescliffe, and lay on the floor like an
      ass; and if he were to ask me to touch his arm, I should be as bad again.
      A fine thing for me to have talked all that arrogant stuff about Richard!
      I hate the thought of it; and, as if to make arrows and barbs of it,
      here&rsquo;s Richard making as much of this as if it was a double first class!
      He afraid to be compared with me, indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Norman, indeed, this is going too far. We can&rsquo;t be as useful as the elder
      ones; and when you know how papa was vexed about Richard, you must be glad
      to have pleased him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I were he, it would only make me miss her more. I believe he only
      makes much of me that he may not disappoint me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. He is really glad, and the more because she would have
      been so pleased. He said it would have been a happy day for her, and there
      was more of the glad look than the sorry one. It was the glistening look
      that comes when he is watching baby, or hearing Margaret say pretty things
      to her. You see it is the first bright morning we have had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Norman; &ldquo;perhaps it was, but I don&rsquo;t know. I thought half of
      it was din.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Norman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And another thing, Ethel, I don&rsquo;t feel as if I had fairly earned it.
      Forder or Cheviot ought to have had it. They are both more really good
      scholars than I am, and have always been above me. There was nothing I
      really knew better, except those historical questions that no one reckoned
      on; and not living at home with their sisters and books, they had no such
      chance, and it is very hard on them, and I don&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but you really and truly beat them in everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, by chance. There were lots of places in construing, where I should
      have broken down if I had happened to be set on in them; it was only a
      wonder I did not in that chorus, for I had only looked at it twice; but
      Everard asked me nothing but what I knew; and now and then I get into a
      funny state, when nothing is too hard for me, and that was how it was
      yesterday evening. Generally, I feel as dull as a post,&rdquo; said Norman,
      yawning and stretching; &ldquo;I could not make a nonsense hexameter this
      minute, if I was to die for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sort of Berserkar fury!&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;like that night you did the
      coral-worm verses. It&rsquo;s very odd. Are you sure you are well, dear Norman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To which he answered, with displeasure, that he was as well as possible,
      ordered her not to go and make any more fuss, and left her hastily. She
      was unhappy, and far from satisfied; she had never known his temper so
      much affected, and was much puzzled; but she was too much afraid of vexing
      him, to impart her perplexity even to Margaret. However, the next day,
      Sunday, as she was reading to Margaret after church, her father came in,
      and the first thing he said was, &ldquo;I want to know what you think of
      Norman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo; said Margaret; &ldquo;in health or spirits?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Both,&rdquo; said Dr. May. &ldquo;Poor boy! he has never held up his head since
      October, and, at his age, that is hardly natural. He goes moping about,
      has lost flesh and appetite, and looks altogether out of order, shooting
      up like a Maypole too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mind and body,&rdquo; said Margaret, while Ethel gazed intently at her father,
      wondering whether she ought to speak, for Margaret did not know half what
      she did; nothing about the bad nights, nor what he called the &ldquo;funny
      state.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, both. I fancied it was only his rapid growth, and the excitement of
      this examination, and that it would go off, but I think there&rsquo;s more
      amiss. He was lounging about doing nothing, when the girls were gone to
      school after dinner, and I asked him to walk down with me to the
      Almshouses. He did not seem very willing, but he went, and presently, as I
      had hold of his arm, I felt him shivering, and saw him turn as pale as a
      sheet. As soon as I noticed it, he flushed crimson, and would not hear of
      turning back, stoutly protesting he was quite well, but I saw his hand was
      quivering even when I got into church. Why, Ethel, you have turned as red
      as he did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he has done it!&rdquo; exclaimed Ethel, in a smothered voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean? Speak, Ethel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has gone past it&mdash;the place,&rdquo; whispered she.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor made a sound of sorrowful assent, as if much struck; then said,
      &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t mean he has never been there since?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;he has always gone round Randall&rsquo;s alley or the
      garden; he has said nothing, but has contrived to avoid it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Dr. May, after a pause, &ldquo;I hoped none of us knew the exact
      spot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t; he never told us, but he was there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was he?&rdquo; exclaimed her father; &ldquo;I had no notion of that. How came he
      there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He went on with Mr. Ernescliffe, and saw it all,&rdquo; said Ethel, as her
      father drew out her words, apparently with his eye; &ldquo;and then came up to
      my room so faint that he was obliged to lie on the floor ever so long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faint&mdash;how long did it last?&rdquo; said her father, examining her without
      apparent emotion, as if it had been an indifferent patient.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, things seemed so long that evening. Till after dark at
      least, and it came on in the morning&mdash;no, the Monday. I believe it
      was your arm&mdash;for talking of going to see you always brought it on,
      till Mr. Ward gave him a dose of brandy-and-water, and that stopped it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I had known this before. Derangement of the nervous system, no
      doubt&mdash;a susceptible boy like that&mdash;I wonder what sort of nights
      he has been having.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Terrible ones,&rdquo; said Ethel; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he ever sleeps quietly till
      morning; he has dreams, and he groans and talks in his sleep; Harry can
      tell you all that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless me!&rdquo; cried Dr. May, in some anger; &ldquo;what have you all been thinking
      about to keep this to yourselves all this time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He could not bear to have it mentioned,&rdquo; said Ethel timidly; &ldquo;and I
      didn&rsquo;t know that it signified so much; does it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It signifies so much, that I had rather have given a thousand pounds than
      have let him go on all this time, to be overworked at school, and wound up
      to that examination!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear! I am sorry!&rdquo; said Ethel, in great dismay. &ldquo;If you had but been
      at home when Cheviot wanted Harry to have sent for you&mdash;because he
      did not think him fit for it!&rdquo; And Ethel was much relieved by pouring out
      all she knew, though her alarm was by no means lessened by the effect it
      produced on her father, especially when he heard of the &ldquo;funny state.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fine state of things,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I wonder it has not brought on a
      tremendous illness by this time. A boy of that sensitive temperament
      meeting with such a shock&mdash;never looked after&mdash;the quietest and
      most knocked down of all, and therefore the most neglected&mdash;his whole
      system disordered&mdash;and then driven to school to be harassed and
      overworked; if we had wanted to occasion brain fever we could not have
      gone a better way to set about it. I should not wonder if health and
      nerves were damaged for life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! papa, papa!&rdquo; cried Ethel, in extreme distress, &ldquo;what shall I do! I
      wish I had told you, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not blaming you, Ethel, you knew no better, but it has been grievous
      neglect. It is plain enough there is no one to see after you,&rdquo; said the
      doctor, with a low groan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We may be taking it in time,&rdquo; said Margaret&rsquo;s soft voice&mdash;&ldquo;it is
      very well it has gone on no longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three months is long enough,&rdquo; said Dr. May.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; continued Margaret, &ldquo;it will be better not to let dear Norman
      know we are uneasy about him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, certainly not. Don&rsquo;t say a word of this to him. I shall find
      Harry, and ask about these disturbed nights, and then watch him, trusting
      it may not have gone too far; but there must be dreadful excitability of
      brain!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went away, leaving Margaret to comfort Ethel as well as she could, by
      showing her that he had not said the mischief was done, putting her in
      mind that he was wont to speak strongly; and trying to make her thankful
      that her brother would now have such care as might avert all evil results.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, oh,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;his success has been dearly purchased!&rdquo;

      &ldquo;Yea hath it?  Use,&rdquo; quod he, &ldquo;this medicine;

                                                    CHAUCER.
</pre>
    <p>
      That night Norman started from, what was not so much sleep, as a trance of
      oppression and suffering, and beheld his father&rsquo;s face watching him
      attentively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa! What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; said he, starting up. &ldquo;Is any one ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; no one, lie down again,&rdquo; said Dr. May, possessing himself of a hand,
      with a burning spot in the palm, and a throbbing pulse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what made you come here? Have I disturbed any one? Have I been
      talking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only mumbling a little, but you looked very uncomfortable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not ill&mdash;what are you feeling my pulse for?&rdquo; said Norman
      uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To see whether that restless sleep has quickened it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norman scarcely let his father count for a moment, before he asked, &ldquo;What
      o&rsquo;clock is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little after twelve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does make you stay up so late, papa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I often do when my arm seems likely to keep me awake. Richard has done
      all I want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray don&rsquo;t stay here in the cold,&rdquo; said Norman, with feverish impatience,
      as he turned upwards the cool side of his pillow. &ldquo;Good-night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No hurry,&rdquo; said his father, still watching him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing the matter,&rdquo; repeated the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you often have such unquiet nights?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it does not signify. Good-night,&rdquo; and he tried to look settled and
      comfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Norman,&rdquo; said his father, in a voice betraying much grief, &ldquo;it will not
      do to go on in this way. If your mother was here, you would not close
      yourself against her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norman interrupted him in a voice strangled with sobs: &ldquo;It is no good
      saying it&mdash;I thought it would only make it worse for you; but that&rsquo;s
      it. I cannot bear the being without her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. May was glad to see that a gush of tears followed this exclamation, as
      Norman hid his face under the coverings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor boy,&rdquo; said he, hardly able to speak, &ldquo;only One can comfort you
      truly; but you must not turn from me; you must let me do what I can for
      you, though it is not the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought it would grieve you more,&rdquo; said Norman, turning his face
      towards him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, to find my children, feeling with me, and knowing what they have
      lost? Surely not, Norman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it is of no use,&rdquo; added Norman, hiding his face again, &ldquo;no one can
      comfort&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you are wrong,&rdquo; said Dr. May, with deep feeling, &ldquo;there is much
      comfort in everything, in everybody, in kindness, in all around, if one
      can only open one&rsquo;s mind to it. But I did not come to keep you awake with
      such talk: I saw you were not quite well, so I came up to see about you;
      and now, Norman, you will not refuse to own that something is the matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not know it,&rdquo; said Norman, &ldquo;I really believe I am well, if I could
      get rid of these horrible nights. I either lie awake, tumbling and
      tossing, or I get all sorts of unbearable dreams.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, when I asked master Harry about you, all the answer I could get was,
      that he was quite used to it, and did not mind it at all. As if I asked
      for his sake! How fast that boy sleeps&mdash;he is fit for a midshipman&rsquo;s
      berth!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But do you think there is anything amiss with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall know more about that to-morrow morning. Come to my room as soon
      as you are up, unless I come to you. Now, I have something to read before
      I go to bed, and I may as well try if it will put you to sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norman&rsquo;s last sight that night was of the outline of his father&rsquo;s profile,
      and he was scarcely awake the next morning before Dr. May was there again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unwilling as he had been to give way, it was a relief to relinquish the
      struggle to think himself well, and to venture to lounge and dawdle, rest
      his heavy head, and stretch his inert limbs without fear of remark. His
      father found him after breakfast lying on the sofa in the drawing-room
      with a Greek play by his side, telling Ethel what words to look out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At it again!&rdquo; exclaimed Dr. May. &ldquo;Carry it away, Ethel. I will have no
      Latin or Greek touched these holidays.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know,&rdquo; said Norman, &ldquo;if I don&rsquo;t sap, I shall have no chance of
      keeping up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll keep nowhere if you don&rsquo;t rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is only Euripides, and I can&rsquo;t do anything else,&rdquo; said Norman
      languidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely, I don&rsquo;t care. You have to get well first of all, and the
      Greek will take care of itself. Go up to Margaret. I put you in her
      keeping, while I am gone to Whitford. After that, I dare say Richard will
      be very glad to have a holiday, and let you drive me to Abbotstoke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norman rose, and wearily walked upstairs, while his sister lingered to
      excuse herself. &ldquo;Papa, I did not think Euripides would hurt him&mdash;he
      knows it all so well, and he said he could not read anything else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so, Ethel. Poor fellow, he has not spirits or energy for anything:
      his mind was forced into those classicalities when it wanted rest, and now
      it has not spring enough to turn back again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think him so very ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exactly, but there&rsquo;s low fever hanging about him, and we must look
      after him well, and I hope we may get him right. I have told Margaret
      about him; I can&rsquo;t stop any longer now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norman found the baby in his sister&rsquo;s room, and this was just what suited
      him. The Daisy showed a marked preference for her brothers; and to find
      her so merry and good with him, pleased and flattered him far more than
      his victory at school. He carried her about, danced her, whistled to her,
      and made her admire her pretty blue eyes in the glass most successfully,
      till nurse carried her off. But perhaps he had been sent up rather too
      soon, for as he sat in the great chair by the fire, he was teased by the
      constant coming and going, all the petty cares of a large household
      transacted by Margaret&mdash;orders to butcher and cook&mdash;Harry racing
      in to ask to take Tom to the river&mdash;Tom, who was to go when his
      lesson was done, coming perpetually to try to repeat the same unhappy bit
      of &lsquo;As in Proesenti&rsquo;, each time in a worse whine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you bear it, Margaret?&rdquo; said Norman, as she finally dismissed
      Tom, and laid down her account-book, taking up some delicate fancy work.
      &ldquo;Mercy, here&rsquo;s another,&rdquo; as enter a message about lamp oil, in the midst
      of which Mary burst in to beg Margaret to get Miss Winter to let her go to
      the river with Harry and Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed, Mary, I could not think of such a thing. You had better go
      back to your lessons, and don&rsquo;t be silly,&rdquo; as she looked much disposed to
      cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one but a Tom-boy would dream of it,&rdquo; added Norman; and Mary departed
      disconsolate, while Margaret gave a sigh of weariness, and said, as she
      returned to her work, &ldquo;There, I believe I have done. I hope I was not
      cross with poor Mary, but it was rather too much to ask.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think how you can help being cross to every one,&rdquo; said Norman, as
      he took away the books she had done with.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid I am,&rdquo; said Margaret sadly. &ldquo;It does get trying at times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think so! This eternal worrying must be more than any one can
      bear, always lying there too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is only now and then that it grows tiresome,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;I am too
      happy to be of some use, and it is too bad to repine, but sometimes a
      feeling comes of its being always the same, as if a little change would be
      such a treat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you very tired of lying in bed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, very, sometimes. I fancy, but it is only fancy, that I could move
      better if I was up and dressed. It has seemed more so lately, since I have
      been stronger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When do you think they will let you get up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the question. I believe papa thinks I might be lifted to the sofa
      now&mdash;and oh! how I long for it&mdash;but then Mr. Ward does not
      approve of my sitting up, even as I am doing now, and wants to keep me
      flat. Papa thinks that of no use, and likely to hurt my general health,
      and I believe the end of it will be that he will ask Sir Matthew Fleet&rsquo;s
      opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that the man he calls Mat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you know they went through the university together, and were at
      Edinburgh and Paris, but they have never met since he set up in London,
      and grew so famous. I believe it would be a great treat to papa to have
      him, and it would be a good thing for papa too; I don&rsquo;t think his arm is
      going on right&mdash;he does not trust to Mr. Ward&rsquo;s treatment, and I am
      sure some one else ought to see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you know, Margaret, that he sits up quite late, because he cannot
      sleep for it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I hear him moving about, but don&rsquo;t tell him so; I would not have him
      guess for the world, that it kept me awake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And does it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, if I think he is awake and in pain I cannot settle myself to sleep;
      but that is no matter; having no exercise, of course I don&rsquo;t sleep so
      much. But I am very anxious about him&mdash;he looks so thin, and gets so
      fagged&mdash;and no wonder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Mr. Everard told me he was quite shocked to see him, and would hardly
      have known him,&rdquo; and Norman groaned from the bottom of his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I shall hope much from Sir Matthew&rsquo;s taking him in hand,&rdquo; said
      Margaret cheerfully; &ldquo;he will mind him, though he will not Mr. Ward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish the holidays were over!&rdquo; said Norman, with a yawn, as expressive
      as a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not civil, on the third day,&rdquo; said Margaret, smiling, &ldquo;when I am
      so glad to have you to look after me, so as to set Flora at liberty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, can I do you any good?&rdquo; said Norman, with a shade of his former
      alacrity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure you can, a great deal. Better not come near me otherwise, for
      I make every one into a slave. I want my morning reading now&mdash;that
      book on Advent, there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I read it to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, that&rsquo;s nice, and I shall get on with baby&rsquo;s frock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norman read, but, ere long, took to yawning; Margaret begged for the book,
      which he willingly resigned, saying, however, that he liked it, only he
      was stupid. She read on aloud, till she heard a succession of heavy
      breathings, and saw him fast asleep, and so he continued till waked by his
      father&rsquo;s coming home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard and Ethel were glad of a walk, for Margaret had found them a
      pleasant errand. Their Cocksmoor children could not go home to dinner
      between service and afternoon school, and Margaret had desired the cook to
      serve them up some broth in the back kitchen, to which the brother and
      sister were now to invite them. Mary was allowed to take her boots to
      Rebekah Watts, since Margaret held that goodness had better be profitable,
      at least at the outset; and Harry and Tom joined the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norman, meantime, was driving his father&mdash;a holiday preferment highly
      valued in the days when Dr. May used only to assume the reins, when his
      spirited horses showed too much consciousness that they had a young hand
      over them, or when the old hack took a fit of laziness. Now, Norman needed
      Richard&rsquo;s assurance that the bay was steady, so far was he from being
      troubled with his ancient desire, that the steed would rear right up on
      his hind legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could neither talk nor listen till he was clear out of the town, and
      found himself master of the animal, and even then the words were few, and
      chiefly spoken by Dr. May, until after going along about three miles of
      the turnpike road, he desired Norman to turn down a cross-country lane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where does this lead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It comes out at Abbotstoke, but I have to go to an outlying farm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa,&rdquo; said Norman, after a few minutes, &ldquo;I wish you would let me do my
      Greek.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that what you have been pondering all this time? What, may not the
      bonus Homerus slumber sometimes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not Homer, it is Euripides. I do assure you, papa, it is no
      trouble, and I get much worse without it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, stop here, the road grows so bad that we will walk, and let the boy
      lead the horse to meet us at Woodcote.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norman followed his father down a steep narrow lane, little better than a
      stony water-course, and began to repeat, &ldquo;If you would but let me do my
      work! I&rsquo;ve got nothing else to do, and now they have put me up, I should
      not like not to keep my place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely, but&mdash;hollo&mdash;how swelled this is!&rdquo; said Dr. May, as
      they came to the bottom of the valley, where a stream rushed along,
      coloured with a turbid creamy yellow, making little whirlpools where it
      crossed the road, and brawling loudly just above where it roared and
      foamed between two steep banks of rock, crossed by a foot-bridge of
      planks, guarded by a handrail of rough poles. The doctor had traversed it,
      and gone a few paces beyond, when, looking back, he saw Norman very pale,
      with one foot on the plank, and one hand grasping the rail. He came back,
      and held out his hand, which Norman gladly caught at, but no sooner was
      the other side attained, than the boy, though he gasped with relief,
      exclaimed, &ldquo;This is too bad! Wait one moment, please, and let me go back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He tried, but the first touch of the shaking rail, and glance at the
      chasm, disconcerted him, and his father, seeing his white cheeks and rigid
      lips, said, &ldquo;Stop, Norman, don&rsquo;t try it. You are not fit,&rdquo; he added, as
      the boy came to him reluctantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear to be such a wretch!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I never used to be. I will
      not&mdash;let me conquer it;&rdquo; and he was turning back, but the doctor took
      his arm, saying decidedly, &ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t have it done. You are only making
      it worse by putting a force on yourself.&rdquo; But the farther Norman was from
      the bridge, the more displeased he was with himself, and more anxious to
      dare it again. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no bearing it,&rdquo; he muttered; &ldquo;let me only run
      back. I&rsquo;ll overtake you. I must do it if no one looks on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No such thing,&rdquo; said the doctor, holding him fast. &ldquo;If you do, you&rsquo;ll
      have it all over again at night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s better than to know I am worse than Tom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you, Norman, it is no such thing. You will recover your tone if
      you will only do as you are told, but your nerves have had a severe shock,
      and when you force yourself in this way, you only increase the mischief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nerves,&rdquo; muttered Norman disdainfully. &ldquo;I thought they were only fit for
      fine ladies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. May smiled. &ldquo;Well, will it content you if I promise that as soon as I
      see fit, I&rsquo;ll bring you here, and let you march over that bridge as often
      as you like?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I must be contented, but I don&rsquo;t like to feel like a fool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need not, while the moral determination is sound.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But my Greek, papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At it again&mdash;I declare, Norman, you are the worst patient I ever
      had!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norman made no answer, and Dr. May presently said, &ldquo;Well, let me hear what
      you have to say about it. I assure you it is not that I don&rsquo;t want you to
      get on, but that I see you are in great need of rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, papa. I know you mean it for my good, but I don&rsquo;t think you do
      know how horrid it is. I have got nothing on earth to do or care for&mdash;the
      school work comes quite easy to me, and I&rsquo;m sure thinking is worse; and
      then&rdquo;&mdash;Norman spoke vehemently&mdash;&ldquo;now they have put me up, it
      will never do to be beaten, and all the four others ought to be able to do
      it. I did not want or expect to be dux, but now I am, you could not bear
      me not to keep my place, and to miss the Randall scholarship, as I
      certainly shall, if I do not work these whole holidays.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Norman, I know it,&rdquo; said his father kindly. &ldquo;I am very sorry for you, and
      I know I am asking of you what I could not have done at your age&mdash;indeed,
      I don&rsquo;t believe I could have done it for you a few months ago. It is my
      fault that you have been let alone, to have an overstrain and pressure on
      your mind, when you were not fit for it, and I cannot see any remedy but
      complete freedom from work. At the same time, if you fret and harass
      yourself about being surpassed, that is, as you say, much worse for you
      than Latin and Greek. Perhaps I may be wrong, and study might not do you
      the harm I think it would; at any rate, it is better than tormenting
      yourself about next half year, so I will not positively forbid it, but I
      think you had much better let it alone. I don&rsquo;t want to make it a matter
      of duty. I only tell you this, that you may set your mind at rest as far
      as I am concerned. If you do lose your place, I will consider it as my own
      doing, and not be disappointed. I had rather see you a healthy, vigorous,
      useful man, than a poor puling nervous wretch of a scholar, if you were to
      get all the prizes in the university.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norman made a little murmuring sound of assent, and both were silent for
      some moments, then he said, &ldquo;Then you will not be displeased, papa, if I
      do read, as long as I feel it does me no harm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you I don&rsquo;t mean to make it a matter of obedience. Do as you
      please&mdash;I had rather you read than vexed yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad of it. Thank you, papa,&rdquo; said Norman, in a much cheered voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had, in the meantime, been mounting a rising ground, clothed with
      stunted wood, and came out on a wide heath, brown with dead bracken; a
      hollow, traced by the tops of leafless trees, marked the course of the
      stream that traversed it, and the inequalities of ground becoming more
      rugged in outlines and grayer in colouring as they receded, till they were
      closed by a dark fir wood, beyond which rose in extreme distance the grand
      mass of Welsh mountain heads, purpled against the evening sky, except
      where the crowning peaks bore a veil of snow. Behind, the sky was pure
      gold, gradually shading into pale green, and then into clear light wintry
      blue, while the sun sitting behind two of the loftiest, seemed to confound
      their outlines, and blend them in one flood of soft hazy brightness. Dr.
      May looked at his son, and saw his face clear up, his brow expand, and his
      lips unclose with admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;it is very fine, is it not? I used to bring mamma
      here now and then for a treat, because it put her in mind of her Scottish
      hills. Well, your&rsquo;s are the golden hills of heaven, now, my Maggie!&rdquo; he
      added, hardly knowing that he spoke aloud. Norman&rsquo;s throat swelled, as he
      looked up in his face, then cast down his eyes hastily to hide the tears
      that had gathered on his eyelashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave you here,&rdquo; said Dr. May; &ldquo;I have to go to a farmhouse close
      by, in the hollow behind us; there&rsquo;s a girl recovering from a fever. I&rsquo;ll
      not be ten minutes, so wait here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he came back, Norman was still where he had left him, gazing
      earnestly, and the tears standing on his cheeks. He did not move till his
      father laid his hand on his shoulder&mdash;they walked away together
      without a word, and scarcely spoke all the way home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. May went to Margaret and talked to her of Norman&rsquo;s fine character, and
      intense affection for his mother, the determined temper, and quietly borne
      grief, for which the doctor seemed to have worked himself into a perfect
      enthusiasm of admiration; but lamenting that he could not tell what to do
      with him&mdash;study or no study hurt him alike&mdash;and he dreaded to
      see health and spirits shattered for ever. They tried to devise change of
      scene, but it did not seem possible just at present; and Margaret, besides
      her fears for Norman, was much grieved to see this added to her father&rsquo;s
      troubles.
    </p>
    <p>
      At night Dr. May again went up to see whether Norman, whom he had moved
      into Margaret&rsquo;s former room, were again suffering from fever. He found him
      asleep in a restless attitude, as if he had just dropped off, and waking
      almost at the instant of his entrance, he exclaimed, &ldquo;Is it you? I thought
      it was mamma. She said it was all ambition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then starting, and looking round the room, and at his father, he collected
      himself, and said, with a slight smile, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know I had been asleep.
      I was awake just now, thinking about it. Papa, I&rsquo;ll give it up. I&rsquo;ll try
      to put next half out of my head, and not mind if they do pass me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, my boy,&rdquo; said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least if Cheviot and Forder do, for they ought. I only hope Anderson
      won&rsquo;t. I can stand anything but that. But that is nonsense too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quite right, Norman,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;and it is a great relief
      to me that you see the thing so sensibly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t see it sensibly at all, papa. I hate it all the time, and I
      don&rsquo;t know whether I can keep from thinking of it, when I have nothing to
      do; but I see it is wrong; I thought all ambition and nonsense was gone
      out of me, when I cared so little for the examination; but now I see,
      though I did not want to be made first, I can&rsquo;t bear not to be first; and
      that&rsquo;s the old story, just as she used to tell me to guard against
      ambition. So I&rsquo;ll take my chance, and if I should get put down, why, &lsquo;twas
      not fair that I should be put up, and it is what I ought to be, and serves
      me right into the bargain&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s the best sort of sense, your mother&rsquo;s sense,&rdquo; said the
      doctor, more affected than he liked to show. &ldquo;No wonder she came to you in
      your dream, Norman, my boy, if you had come to such a resolution. I was
      half in hopes you had some such notion when I came upon you, on Far-view
      down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that sky did it,&rdquo; said Norman, in a low voice; &ldquo;it made me think
      of her in a different way&mdash;and what you said too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did I say? I don&rsquo;t remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Norman could not repeat the words, and only murmured, &ldquo;Golden hills.&rdquo;
       It was enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;you had dwelt on the blank here, not taken home
      what it is to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; almost sobbed Norman, &ldquo;I never could before&mdash;that made me,&rdquo;
       after a long silence, &ldquo;and then I know how foolish I was, and how she
      would say it was wrong to make this fuss, when you did not like it, about
      my place, and that it was not for the sake of my duty, but of ambition. I
      knew that, but till I went to bed to-night, I could not tell whether I
      could make up my mind, so I would say nothing.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XIII.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     The days are sad, it is the Holy tide,
     When flowers have ceased to blow and birds to sing.
                                               F. TENNYSON.
</pre>
    <p>
      It had been a hard struggle to give up all thoughts of study, and Norman
      was not at first rewarded for it, but rather exemplified the truth of his
      own assertion, that he was worse without it; for when this sole occupation
      for his mind was taken away, he drooped still more. He would willingly
      have shown his father that he was not discontented, but he was too
      entirely unnerved to be either cheerful or capable of entering with
      interest into any occupation. If he had been positively ill, the task
      would have been easier, but the low intermittent fever that hung about him
      did not confine him to bed, only kept him lounging, listless and forlorn,
      through the weary day, not always able to go out with his father, and on
      Christmas Day unfit even for church.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this made the want of his mother, and the vacancy in his home, still
      more evident, and nothing was capable of relieving his sadness but his
      father&rsquo;s kindness, which was a continual surprise to him. Dr. May was a
      parent who could not fail to be loved and honoured; but, as a busy man,
      trusting all at home to his wife, he had only appeared to his children
      either as a merry playfellow, or as a stern paternal authority, not often
      in the intermediate light of guiding friend, or gentle guardian; and it
      affected Norman exceedingly to find himself, a tall schoolboy, watched and
      soothed with motherly tenderness and affection; with complete
      comprehension of his feelings, and delicate care of them. His father&rsquo;s
      solicitude and sympathy were round him day and night, and this, in the
      midst of so much toil, pain, grief, and anxiety of his own, that Norman
      might well feel overwhelmed with the swelling, inexpressible feelings of
      grateful affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      How could his father know exactly what he would like&mdash;say the very
      things he was thinking&mdash;see that his depression was not wilful
      repining&mdash;find exactly what best soothed him! He wondered, but he
      could not have said so to any one, only his eye brightened, and, as his
      sisters remarked, he never seemed half so uncomfortable when papa was in
      the room. Indeed, the certainty that his father felt the sorrow as acutely
      as himself, was one reason of his opening to him. He could not feel that
      his brothers and sisters did so, for, outwardly, their habits were
      unaltered, their spirits not lowered, their relish for things around much
      the same as before, and this had given Norman a sense of isolation. With
      his father it was different. Norman knew he could never appreciate what
      the bereavement was to him&mdash;he saw its traces in almost every word
      and look, and yet perceived that something sustained and consoled him,
      though not in the way of forgetfulness. Now and then Norman caught at what
      gave this comfort, and it might be hoped he would do so increasingly;
      though, on this Christmas Day, Margaret felt very sad about him, as she
      watched him sitting over the fire, cowering with chilliness and headache,
      while every one was gone to church, and saw that the reading of the
      service with her had been more of a trouble than a solace.
    </p>
    <p>
      She tried to think it bodily ailment, and strove hard not to pine for her
      mother, to comfort them both, and say the fond words of refreshing
      cheering pity that would have made all light to bear. Margaret&rsquo;s home
      Christmas was so spent in caring for brother, father, and children, that
      she had hardly time to dwell on the sad change that had befallen herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christmas was a season that none of them knew well how to meet: Blanche
      was overheard saying to Mary that she wished it would not come, and Mary,
      shaking her head, and answering that she was afraid that was naughty, but
      it was very tiresome to have no fun. Margaret did her best upstairs, and
      Richard downstairs, by the help of prints and hymns, to make the children
      think of the true joy of Christmas, and in the evening their father
      gathered them round, and told them the stories of the Shepherds and of the
      Wise Men, till Mary and Blanche agreed, as they went up to bed, that it
      had been a very happy evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day Harry discomfited the schoolroom by bursting in with the news
      that &ldquo;Louisa and Fanny Anderson were bearing down on the front door.&rdquo;
       Ethel and Flora were obliged to appear in the drawing-room, where they
      were greeted by two girls, rather older than themselves. A whole shower of
      inquiries for Dr. May, for Margaret, and for the dear little baby, were
      first poured out; then came hopes that Norman was well, as they had not
      seen him at church yesterday.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, he was kept at home by a bad headache, but it is better
      to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We came to congratulate you on his success&mdash;we could not help it&mdash;it
      must have been such a pleasure to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That it was!&rdquo; exclaimed Ethel, pleased at participation in her rejoicing.
      &ldquo;We were so surprised.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flora gave a glance of warning, but Ethel&rsquo;s short-sighted eyes were beyond
      the range of correspondence, and Miss Anderson continued. &ldquo;It must have
      been a delightful surprise. We could hardly believe it when Harvey came in
      and told us. Every one thought Forder was sure, but they all were put out
      by the questions of general information&mdash;those were all Mr. Everard&rsquo;s
      doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Everard was very much struck with Norman&rsquo;s knowledge and scholarship
      too,&rdquo; said Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So every one says. It was all Mr. Everard&rsquo;s doing. Miss Harrison told
      mamma, but, for my part, I am very glad for the sake of Stoneborough; I
      like a town boy to be at the head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Norman was sorry for Forder and Cheviot,&rdquo; began Ethel. Flora tried to
      stop her, but Louisa Anderson caught at what she said, and looked eagerly
      for more. &ldquo;He felt,&rdquo; said she, only thinking of exalting her generous
      brother, &ldquo;as if it was hardly right, when they are so much his seniors,
      that he could scarcely enjoy it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! that is just what people say,&rdquo; replied Louisa. &ldquo;But it must be very
      gratifying to you, and it makes him certain of the Randal scholarship too,
      I suppose. It is a great thing for him! He must have worked very hard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that he has,&rdquo; said Flora; &ldquo;he is so fond of study, and that goes
      halfway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So is dear Harvey. How earnest he is over his books! Mamma sometimes
      says, &lsquo;Now Harvey, dear, you&rsquo;ll be quite stupified, you&rsquo;ll be ill; I
      really shall get Dr. May to forbid you.&rsquo; I suppose Norman is very busy
      too; it is quite the fashion for boys not to be idle now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Norman can&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; said Ethel piteously. &ldquo;Papa will not hear of
      his doing any Latin or Greek these whole holidays.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He thinks he will come to it better again for entire rest,&rdquo; said Flora,
      launching another look at her sister, which again fell short.
    </p>
    <p>
      A great deal of polite inquiry whether they were uneasy about him
      followed, mixed with a little boasting of dear Harvey&rsquo;s diligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By-the-bye, Ethel, it is you that are the great patroness of the wild
      Cocksmoor children&mdash;are not you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel coloured, and mumbled, and Flora answered for her, &ldquo;Richard and
      Ethel have been there once or twice. You know our under nursery-maid is a
      Cocksmoor girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, mamma said she could not think how Miss May could take one from
      thence. The whole place is full of thieves, and do you know, Bessie
      Boulder has lost her gold pencil-case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has she?&rdquo; said Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she had it on Sunday when she was teaching her class.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Ethel vehemently; &ldquo;surely she does not suspect any of those
      poor children!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only know such a thing never happened at school before,&rdquo; said Fanny,
      &ldquo;and I shall never take anything valuable there again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But is she sure she lost it at school?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, quite certain. She will not accuse any one, but it is not
      comfortable. And how those children do behave at church!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor things! they have been sadly neglected,&rdquo; said Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are quite spoiling the rest, and they are such figures! Why don&rsquo;t
      you, at least, make them cut their hair? You know it is the rule of the
      school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, but half the girls in the first class wear it long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, but those are the superior people, that one would not be strict
      with, and they dress it so nicely too. Now these are like little savages.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard thinks it might drive them away to insist at first,&rdquo; said Ethel;
      &ldquo;we will try to bring it about in time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mrs. Ledwich is nearly resolved to insist, so you had better be
      warned, Ethel. She cannot suffer such untidiness and rags to spoil the
      appearance of the school, and, I assure you, it is quite unpleasant to the
      teachers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish they would give them all to me!&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;But I do hope Mrs.
      Ledwich will have patience with them, for they are only to be gained
      gently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The visitors took their leave, and the two sisters began exclaiming&mdash;Ethel
      at their dislike of her proteges, and Flora at what they had said of
      Norman. &ldquo;And you, Ethel, how could you go and tell them we were surprised,
      and Norman thought it was hard on the other boys? They&rsquo;ll have it all over
      the town that he got it unjustly, and knows it, as they say already it was
      partiality of Mr. Everard&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, no, they never can be so bad!&rdquo; cried Ethel; &ldquo;they must have
      understood better that it was his noble humility and generosity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They understand anything noble! No, indeed! They think every one like
      their own beautiful brother! I knew what they came for all the time; they
      wanted to know whether Norman was able to work these holidays, and you
      told them the very thing they wanted to hear. How they will rejoice with
      that Harvey, and make sure of the Randall!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, no!&rdquo; cried Ethel; &ldquo;Norman must get that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he will,&rdquo; said Flora, &ldquo;losing all this time, while they are
      working. It cannot be helped, of course, but it is a great pity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I almost wish he had not been put up at all, if it is to end in this
      way,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;It is very provoking, and to have them triumphing as
      they will! There&rsquo;s no bearing it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Norman, certainly, is not at all well, poor fellow,&rdquo; said Flora, &ldquo;and I
      suppose he wants rest, but I wish papa would let him do what he can. It
      would be much better for him than moping about as he is always doing now;
      and the disappointment of losing his place will be grievous, though now he
      fancies he does not care for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder when he will ever care for anything again. All I read and tell
      him only seems to tease him, though he tries to thank me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a strange apathy about him,&rdquo; said Flora, &ldquo;but I believe it is
      chiefly for want of exertion. I should like to rouse him if papa would let
      me; I know I could, by telling him how these Andersons are reckoning on
      his getting down. If he does, I shall be ready to run away, that I may
      never meet any one here again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel was very unhappy till she was able to pour all this trouble out to
      Margaret, and worked herself almost into crying about Norman&rsquo;s being
      passed by &ldquo;that Harvey,&rdquo; and his sisters exulting, and papa being vexed,
      and Norman losing time and not caring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you are wrong,&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;Norman did care very much, and it
      was not till he had seen clearly that it was a matter of duty to do as
      papa thought right, and not agitate his mind about his chances of keeping
      up, that he could bear to give up his work;&rdquo; and she told Ethel a little
      of what had passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel was much struck. &ldquo;But oh, Margaret, it is very hard, just to have
      him put up for the sake of being put down, and pleasing the Andersons!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Ethel, why should you mind so much about the Andersons? May they not
      care about their brother as we do for ours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such a brother to care about!&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I suppose they may like him the best,&rdquo; said Margaret, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose they do,&rdquo; said Ethel grudgingly; &ldquo;but still I cannot bear to
      see Norman doing nothing, and I know Harvey Anderson will beat him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely you had rather he did nothing than made himself ill!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure, but I wish it wasn&rsquo;t so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but, Ethel, whose doing is his getting into this state?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel looked grave. &ldquo;It was wrong of me,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;but then papa is not
      sure that Greek would hurt him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not sure, but he thinks it not wise to run the risk. But, Ethel, dear,
      why are you so bent on his being dux at all costs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be horrid if he was not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember you used to say that outward praise or honour was not
      to be cared for as long as one did one&rsquo;s duty, and that it might be a
      temptation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know I did,&rdquo; said Ethel, faltering, &ldquo;but that was for oneself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is harder, I think, to feel so about those we care for,&rdquo; said
      Margaret; &ldquo;but after all, this is just what will show whether our pride in
      Norman is the right true loving pride, or whether it is only the family
      vanity of triumphing over the Andersons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel hung her head. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s some of that,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but it is not all.
      No&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want to triumph over them, nobody would do that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not outwardly perhaps, but in their hearts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;but it is the being triumphed over that I
      cannot bear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps this is all a lesson in humility for us,&rdquo; said Margaret &ldquo;It is
      teaching us, &lsquo;Whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased, and he that
      humbleth himself shall be exalted.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel was silent for some little space, then suddenly exclaimed, &ldquo;And you
      think he will really be put down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret seemed to have been talking with little effect, but she kept her
      patience, and answered, &ldquo;I cannot guess, Ethel, but I&rsquo;ll tell you one
      thing&mdash;I think there&rsquo;s much more chance if he comes to his work fresh
      and vigorous after a rest, than if he went on dulling himself with it all
      this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With which Ethel was so far appeased that she promised to think as little
      as she could of the Andersons, and a walk with Richard to Cocksmoor turned
      the current of her thoughts. They had caught some more Sunday-school
      children by the help of Margaret&rsquo;s broth, but it was uphill work; the
      servants did not like such guests in the kitchen, and they were still less
      welcome at school.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think I heard, Ethel?&rdquo; said Flora, the next Sunday, as they
      joined each other in the walk from school to church; &ldquo;I heard Miss Graves
      say to Miss Boulder, &lsquo;I declare I must remonstrate. I undertook to
      instruct a national, not a ragged school;&rsquo; and then Miss Boulder shook out
      her fine watered silk and said, &lsquo;It positively is improper to place ladies
      in contact with such squalid objects.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ladies!&rdquo; cried Ethel. &ldquo;A stationer&rsquo;s daughter and a banker&rsquo;s clerk&rsquo;s! Why
      do they come to teach at school at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because our example makes it genteel,&rdquo; said Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you did something more in hopes of making it genteel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I caught one of your ragged regiment with her frock gaping behind, and
      pinned it up. Such rags as there were under it! Oh, Ethel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That merry Irish-looking child. I don&rsquo;t know her name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! it is a real charming Irish name, Una M&rsquo;Carthy. I am so glad you did
      it, Flora. I hope they were ashamed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doubt whether it will do good. We are sure of our station and can do
      anything&mdash;they are struggling to be ladies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we ought not to talk of them any more, Flora; here we are almost at
      the churchyard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Tuesday of this week was appointed for the visit of the London
      surgeon, Sir Matthew Fleet, and the expectation caused Dr. May to talk
      much to Margaret of old times, and the days of his courtship, when it had
      been his favourite project that his friend and fellow-student should marry
      Flora Mackenzie, and there had been a promising degree of liking, but
      &ldquo;Mat&rdquo; had been obliged to be prudent, and had ended by never marrying at
      all. This the doctor, as well as his daughters, believed was for the sake
      of Aunt Flora, and thus the girls were a good deal excited about his
      coming, almost as much on his own account, as because they considered him
      as the arbiter of Margaret&rsquo;s fate. He only came in time for a seven
      o&rsquo;clock dinner, and Margaret did not see him that night, but heard enough
      from her sisters, when they came up to tell the history of their guest,
      and of the first set dinner when Flora had acted as lady of the house. The
      dinner it appeared had gone off very well. Flora had managed admirably,
      and the only mishap was some awkward carving of Ethel&rsquo;s which had caused
      the dish to be changed with Norman. As to the guest, Flora said he was
      very good-looking and agreeable. Ethel abruptly pronounced, &ldquo;I am very
      glad Aunt Flora married Uncle Arnott instead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think why,&rdquo; said Flora. &ldquo;I never saw a person of pleasanter
      manners.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did they talk of old times?&rdquo; said Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Ethel; &ldquo;that was the thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would not have them talk of those matters in the middle of dinner,&rdquo;
       said Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; again said Ethel; &ldquo;but papa has a way&mdash;don&rsquo;t you know,
      Margaret, how one can tell in a moment if it is company talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was the conversation about?&rdquo; said Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They talked over some of their fellow-students,&rdquo; said Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ethel; &ldquo;and then when papa told him that beautiful history of
      Dr. Spencer going to take care of those poor emigrants in the fever, what
      do you think he said? &lsquo;Yes, Spencer was always doing extravagant things.&rsquo;
      Fancy that to papa, who can hardly speak of it without having to wipe his
      spectacles, and who so longs to hear of Dr. Spencer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what did he say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing; so Flora and Sir Matthew got to pictures and all that sort of
      thing, and it was all company talk after that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most entertaining in its kind,&rdquo; said Flora: &ldquo;but&mdash;oh, Norman!&rdquo; as he
      entered&mdash;&ldquo;why, they are not out of the dining-room yet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; they are talking of some new invention, and most likely will not come
      for an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to bed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa followed me out of the dining-room to tell me to do so after tea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then sit down there, and I&rsquo;ll go and make some, and let it come up with
      Margaret&rsquo;s. Come, Ethel. Good-night, Norman. Is your head aching
      to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much, now I have got out of the dining-room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would have been wiser not to have gone in,&rdquo; said Flora, leaving the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was not the dinner, but the man,&rdquo; said Norman. &ldquo;It is incomprehensible
      to me how my father could take to him. I&rsquo;d as soon have Harvey Anderson
      for a friend!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are like me,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;in being glad he is not our uncle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He presume to think of falling in love with Aunt Flora!&rdquo; cried Norman
      indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what is the matter with him?&rdquo; asked Margaret. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t find much
      ground for Ethel&rsquo;s dislike, and Flora is pleased.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She did not hear the worst, nor you either, Ethel,&rdquo; said Norman. &ldquo;I could
      not stand the cold hard way he spoke of hospital patients. I am sure he
      thinks poor people nothing but a study, and rich ones nothing but a
      profit. And his half sneers! But what I hated most was his way of avoiding
      discussions. When he saw he had said what would not go down with papa, he
      did not honestly stand up to the point, and argue it out, but seemed to
      have no mind of his own, and to be only talking to please papa&mdash;but
      not knowing how to do it. He understand my father indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norman&rsquo;s indignation had quite revived him, and Margaret was much
      entertained with the conflicting opinions. The next was Richard&rsquo;s, when he
      came in late to wish her good-night, after he had been attending on Sir
      Matthew&rsquo;s examination of his father&rsquo;s arm. He did nothing but admire the
      surgeon&rsquo;s delicacy of touch and understanding of the case, his view
      agreeing much better with Dr. May&rsquo;s own than that with Mr. Ward&rsquo;s. Dr. May
      had never been entirely satisfied with the present mode of treatment, and
      Richard was much struck by hearing him say, in answer to Sir Matthew, that
      he knew his recovery might have been more speedy and less painful if he
      had been able to attend to it at first, or to afford time for being longer
      laid up. A change of treatment was now to be made, likely soon to relieve
      the pain, to be less tedious and troublesome, and to bring about a
      complete cure in three or four months at latest. In hearing such tidings,
      there could be little thought of the person who brought them, and Margaret
      did not, till the last moment, learn that Richard thought Sir Matthew very
      clever and sensible, and certain to understand her case. Her last visitor
      was her father: &ldquo;Asleep, Margaret? I thought I had better go to Norman
      first in case he should be awake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but his pulse is better to-night. He was lying awake to hear what
      Fleet thought of me. I suppose Richard told you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear papa; what a comfort it is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those fellows in London do keep up to the mark! But I would not be there
      for something. I never saw a man so altered. However, if he can only do
      for you as well&mdash;but it is of no use talking about it. I may trust
      you to keep yourself calm, my dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am trying&mdash;indeed I am, dear papa. If you could help being anxious
      for me&mdash;though I know it is worse for you, for I only have to lie
      still, and you have to settle for me. But I have been thinking how well
      off I am, able to enjoy so much, and be employed all day long. It is
      nothing to compare with that poor girl you told me of, and you need not be
      unhappy for me. I have some verses to say over to myself to-night:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        &ldquo;O Lord my God, do Thou Thy holy will,
                I will lie still,
        I will not stir, lest I forsake Thine arm
                And break the charm
        That lulls me, clinging to my Father&rsquo;s breast
                In perfect rest.&rdquo;
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is not that comfortable?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My child&mdash;my dear child&mdash;I will say no more, lest I should
      break your sweet peace with my impatience. I will strive for the same
      temper, my Margaret. Bless you, dearest, good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a night spent in waking intervals of such thoughts, Margaret found
      the ordinary morning, and the talk she could not escape, somewhat
      oppressive. Her brothers and sisters disturbed her by their open
      expressions of hope and anxiety; she dreaded to have the balance of
      tranquillity overset; and then blamed herself for selfishness in not being
      as ready to attend to them as usual. Ethel and Norman came up after
      breakfast, their aversion by no means decreased by further acquaintance.
      Ethel was highly indignant at the tone in which he had exclaimed, &ldquo;What,
      May, have you one as young as this?&rdquo; on discovering the existence of the
      baby; and when Norman observed that was not so atrocious either, she
      proceeded, &ldquo;You did not hear the contemptuous, compassionate tone when he
      asked papa what he meant to do with all these boys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad he has not to settle,&rdquo; said Norman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa said Harry was to be a sailor, and he said it was a good way to save
      expenses of education&mdash;a good thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; said Norman, &ldquo;he thinks papa only wants to get rid of us, or
      if not, that it is an amiable weakness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t see anything so shocking in this,&rdquo; said Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not the words,&rdquo; said Norman, &ldquo;the look and tone convey it; but
      there are different opinions. Flora is quite smitten with him, he talks so
      politely to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Blanche!&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;The little affected pussy-cat made a set at
      him, bridled and talked in her mincing voice, with all her airs, and made
      him take a great deal of notice of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nurse here came to prepare for the surgeon&rsquo;s visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was over, and Margaret awaited the judgment. Sir Matthew had spoken
      hopefully to her, but she feared to fasten hopes on what might have no
      meaning, and could rely on nothing, till she had seen her father, who
      never kept back his genuine opinion, and would least of all from her. She
      found her spirits too much agitated to talk to her sisters, and quietly
      begged them to let her be quite alone till the consultation was over, and
      she lay trying to prepare herself to submit thankfully, whether she might
      be bidden to resign herself to helplessness, or to let her mind open once
      more to visions of joyous usefulness. Every step she hoped would prove to
      be her father&rsquo;s approach, and the longest hour of her life was that before
      he entered her room. His face said that the tidings were good, and yet she
      could not ask.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Margaret, I am glad we had him down. He thinks you may get about
      again, though it may be a long time first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he?&mdash;oh, papa!&rdquo; and the colour spread over her face, as she
      squeezed his hand very fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has known the use of the limbs return almost suddenly after even a
      year or two,&rdquo; and Dr. May gave her the grounds of the opinion, and an
      account of other like cases, which he said had convinced him, &ldquo;though, my
      poor child,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I feared the harm I had done you was irremediable,
      but thanks&mdash;&rdquo; He turned away his face, and the clasp of their hands
      spoke the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he told Margaret that she was no longer to be kept prostrate,
      but she was to do exactly as was most comfortable to her, avoiding nothing
      but fatigue. She might be lifted to the sofa the next day, and if that
      agreed with her, she might be carried downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, in itself, after she had been confined to her bed for three months,
      was a release from captivity, and all the brothers and sisters rejoiced as
      if she was actually on her feet again. Richard betook himself to
      constructing a reading-frame for the sofa; Harry tormented Miss Winter by
      insisting on a holiday for the others, and gained the day by an appeal to
      his father; then declared he should go and tell Mr. Wilmot the good news;
      and Norman, quite enlivened, took up his hat, and said he would come too.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all his joy, however, Dr. May could not cease bewailing the alteration
      in his old friend, and spent half the evening in telling Margaret how
      different he had once been, in terms little less measured than Ethel&rsquo;s: &ldquo;I
      never saw such a change. Mat Fleet was one of the most warm, open-hearted
      fellows in the world, up to anything. I can hardly believe he is the same&mdash;turned
      into a mere machine, with a moving spring of self-interest! I don&rsquo;t
      believe he cares a rush for any living thing! Except for your sake,
      Margaret, I wish I had never seen him again, and only remembered him as he
      was at Edinburgh, as I remembered dear old Spencer. It is a grievous
      thing! Ruined entirely! No doubt that London life must be trying&mdash;the
      constant change and bewilderment of patients preventing much individual
      care and interest. It must be very hardening. No family ties either,
      nothing to look to but pushing his way. Yes! there&rsquo;s great excuse for poor
      Mat. I never knew fully till now the blessing it was that your dear mother
      was willing to take me so early, and that this place was open to me with
      all its home connections and interests. I am glad I never had anything to
      do with London!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And when he was alone with Norman, he could not help saying, &ldquo;Norman, my
      boy, I&rsquo;m more glad than ever you yielded to me about your Greek these
      holidays, and for the reason you did. Take care the love of rising and
      pushing never gets hold of you; there&rsquo;s nothing that faster changes a man
      from his better self.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Sir Matthew Fleet had met another old college friend in London,
      and was answering his inquiries for the Dick May of ancient times.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor May! I never saw a man so thrown away. With his talent and
      acuteness, he might be the most eminent man of his day, if he had only
      known how to use them. But he was always the same careless, soft-hearted
      fellow, never knowing how to do himself any good, and he is the same
      still, not a day older nor wiser. It was a fatal thing for him that there
      was that country practice ready for him to step into, and even of that he
      does not make as good a thing as he might. Of course, he married early,
      and there he is, left a widower with a house full of children&mdash;screaming
      babies, and great tall sons growing up, and he without a notion what he
      shall do with them, as heedless as ever&mdash;saving nothing, of course. I
      always knew it was what he would come to, if he would persist in burying
      himself in that wretched little country town, but I hardly thought, after
      all he has gone through, to find him such a mere boy still. And yet he is
      one of the cleverest men I ever met&mdash;with such talent, and such
      thorough knowledge of his profession, that it does one good to hear him
      talk. Poor May! I am sorry for him, he might have been anything, but that
      early marriage and country practice were the ruin of him.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XIV.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     To thee, dear maid, each kindly wile
       Was known, that elder sisters know,
     To check the unseasonable smile,
       With warning hand and serious brow.

     From dream to dream with her to rove,
       Like fairy nurse with hermit child;
     Teach her to think, to pray, to love,
       Make grief less bitter, joy less wild.
                          LINES ON A MONUMENT AT LICHFIELD.
</pre>
    <p>
      Sir Matthew Fleet&rsquo;s visit seemed like a turning-point with the May family,
      rousing and giving them revived hopes. Norman began to shake off his
      extreme languor and depression, the doctor was relieved from much of the
      wearing suffering from his hurt, and his despondency as to Margaret&rsquo;s
      ultimate recovery had been driven away. The experiment of taking her up
      succeeded so well, that on Sunday she was fully attired, &ldquo;fit to receive
      company.&rdquo; As she lay on the sofa there seemed an advance toward recovery.
      Much sweet coquetry was expended in trying to look her best for her
      father; and her best was very well, for though the brilliant bloom of
      health was gone, her cheeks had not lost their pretty rounded contour, and
      still had some rosiness, while her large bright blue eyes smiled and
      sparkled. A screen shut out the rest of the room, making a sort of little
      parlour round the fire, where sundry of the family were visiting her after
      coming home from church in the afternoon. Ethel was in a vehement state of
      indignation at what had that day happened at school. &ldquo;Did you ever hear
      anything like it! When the point was, to teach the poor things to be
      Christians, to turn them back, because their hair was not regulation
      length!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that! Who did?&rdquo; said Dr. May, coming in from his own room, where
      he had heard a few words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Ledwich. She sent back three of the Cocksmoor children this morning.
      It seems she warned them last Sunday without saying a word to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sent them back from church!&rdquo; said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exactly from church,&rdquo; said Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the same in effect,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;to turn them from school; for if
      they did try to go alone, the pew-openers would drive them out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a wretched state of things!&rdquo; said Dr. May, who never wanted much
      provocation to begin storming about parish affairs. &ldquo;When I am
      churchwarden again, I&rsquo;ll see what can be done about the seats; but it&rsquo;s no
      sort of use, while Ramsden goes on as he does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now my poor children are done for!&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;They will never come
      again. And it&rsquo;s horrid, papa; there are lots of town children who wear
      immense long plaits of hair, and Mrs. Ledwich never interferes with them.
      It is entirely to drive the poor Cocksmoor ones away&mdash;for nothing
      else, and all out of Fanny Anderson&rsquo;s chatter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ethel, my dear,&rdquo; said Margaret pleadingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you, Margaret, how, as soon as Flora knew what Mrs. Ledwich
      was going to do, she went and told her this was the children&rsquo;s only
      chance, and if we affronted them for a trifle, there would be no hope of
      getting them back. She said she was sorry, if we were interested for them,
      but rules must not be broken; and when Flora spoke of all who do wear long
      hair unmolested, she shuffled and said, for the sake of the teachers, as
      well as the other children, rags and dirt could not be allowed; and then
      she brought up the old story of Miss Boulder&rsquo;s pencil, though she has
      found it again, and ended by saying Fanny Anderson told her it was a
      serious annoyance to the teachers, and she was sure we should agree with
      her, that something was due to voluntary assistants and subscribers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid there has been a regular set at them,&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;and
      perhaps they are troublesome, poor things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As if school-keeping were for luxury!&rdquo; said Dr. May. &ldquo;It is the worst
      thing I have heard of Mrs. Ledwich yet! One&rsquo;s blood boils to think of
      those poor children being cast off because our fine young ladies are too
      grand to teach them! The clergyman leaving his work to a set of conceited
      women, and they turning their backs on ignorance, when it comes to their
      door! Voluntary subscribers, indeed! I&rsquo;ve a great mind I&rsquo;ll be one no
      longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, papa, that would not be fair&mdash;&rdquo; began Ethel; but Margaret knew
      he would not act on this, squeezed her hand, and silenced her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One thing I&rsquo;ve said, and I&rsquo;ll hold to it,&rdquo; continued Dr. May; &ldquo;if they
      outvote Wilmot again in your Ladies&rsquo; Committee, I&rsquo;ll have no more to do
      with them, as sure as my name&rsquo;s Dick May. It is a scandal the way things
      are done here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa,&rdquo; said Richard, who had all the time been standing silent, &ldquo;Ethel
      and I have been thinking, if you approved, whether we could not do
      something towards teaching the Cocksmoor children, and breaking them in
      for the Sunday-school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What a bound Ethel&rsquo;s heart gave, and how full of congratulation and
      sympathy was the pressure of Margaret&rsquo;s hand!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you think of doing?&rdquo; said the doctor. Ethel burned to reply, but
      her sister&rsquo;s hand admonished her to remember her compact. Richard
      answered, &ldquo;We thought of trying to get a room, and going perhaps once or
      twice a week to give them a little teaching. It would be little enough,
      but it might do something towards civilising them, and making them wish
      for more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you propose to get a room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have reconnoitred, and I think I know a cottage with a tolerable
      kitchen, which I dare say we might hire for an afternoon for sixpence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel, unable to bear it any longer, threw herself forward, and sitting on
      the ground at her father&rsquo;s feet, exclaimed, &ldquo;Oh, papa! papa! do say we
      may!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this about?&rdquo; said the doctor, surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you don&rsquo;t know how I have thought of it day and night these two
      months!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Ethel, have a fancy for two whole months, and the whole house not
      hear of it!&rdquo; said her father, with a rather provoking look of incredulity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard was afraid of bothering you, and wouldn&rsquo;t let me. But do speak,
      papa. May we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see any objection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She clasped her hands in ecstasy. &ldquo;Thank you! thank you, papa! Oh,
      Ritchie! Oh, Margaret!&rdquo; cried she, in a breathless voice of transport.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have worked yourself up to a fine pass,&rdquo; said the doctor, patting the
      agitated girl fondly as she leaned against his knee. &ldquo;Remember, slow and
      steady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got Richard to help me,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sufficient guarantee,&rdquo; said her father, smiling archly as he looked up to
      his son, whose fair face had coloured deep red. &ldquo;You will keep the Unready
      in order, Ritchie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He does,&rdquo; said Margaret; &ldquo;he has taken her education into his hands, and
      I really believe he has taught her to hold up her frock and stick in
      pins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to know her right hand from her left, eh, Ethel? Well, you deserve
      some credit, then. Suppose we ask Mr. Wilmot to tea, and talk it over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, thank you, papa! When shall it be? To-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, if you like. I have to go to the town-council meeting, and am not
      going into the country, so I shall be in early.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. Oh, how very nice!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what about cost? Do you expect to rob me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you would help us,&rdquo; said Ethel, with an odd shy manner; &ldquo;we meant to
      make what we have go as far as may be, but mine is only fifteen and
      sixpence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you must make interest with Margaret for the turn-out of my pocket
      to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, we are very much obliged,&rdquo; said the brother and sister
      earnestly, &ldquo;that is more than we expected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! don&rsquo;t thank too soon. Suppose to-morrow should be a blank day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;I shall tell Norman to make you go to paying
      people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s avarice!&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;But look you here, Ethel, if you&rsquo;ll
      take my advice, you&rsquo;ll make your bargain for Tuesday. I have a note
      appointing me to call at Abbotstoke Grange on Mr. Rivers, at twelve
      o&rsquo;clock, on Tuesday. What do you think of that, Ethel? An old banker, rich
      enough for his daughter to curl her hair in bank-notes. If I were you, I&rsquo;d
      make a bargain for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he had nothing the matter with him, and I only got one guinea out of
      him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prudence! Well, it may be wiser.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel ran up to her room, hardly able to believe that the mighty proposal
      was made; and it had been so readily granted, that it seemed as if
      Richard&rsquo;s caution had been vain in making such a delay, that even Margaret
      had begun to fear that the street of by-and-by was leading to the house of
      never. Now, however, it was plain that he had been wise. Opportunity was
      everything; at another moment, their father might have been harassed and
      oppressed, and unable to give his mind to concerns, which now he could
      think of with interest, and Richard could not have caught a more
      favourable conjuncture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel was in a wild state of felicity all that evening and the next day,
      very unlike her brother, who, dismayed at the open step he had taken,
      shrank into himself, and in his shyness dreaded the discussion in the
      evening, and would almost have been relieved, if Mr. Wilmot had been
      unable to accept the invitation. So quiet and grave was he, that Ethel
      could not get him to talk over the matter at all with her, and she was
      obliged to bestow all her transports and grand projects on Flora or
      Margaret, when she could gain their ears, besides conning them over to
      herself, as an accompaniment to her lessons, by which means she tried Miss
      Winter&rsquo;s patience almost beyond measure. But she cared not&mdash;she saw a
      gathering school and rising church, which eclipsed all thought of present
      inattentions and gaucheries. She monopolised Margaret in the twilight, and
      rhapsodised to her heart&rsquo;s content, talking faster and faster, and looking
      more and more excited. Margaret began to feel a little overwhelmed, and
      while answering &ldquo;yes&rdquo; at intervals, was considering whether Ethel had not
      been flying about in an absent inconsiderate mood all day, and whether it
      would seem unkind to damp her ardour, by giving her a hint that she was
      relaxing her guard over herself. Before Margaret had steeled herself,
      Ethel was talking of a story she had read, of a place something like
      Cocksmoor. Margaret was not ready with her recollection, and Ethel, saying
      it was in a magazine in the drawing-room chiffonier, declared she would
      fetch it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret knew what it was to expect her visitors to return &ldquo;in one
      moment,&rdquo; and with a &ldquo;now-or-never&rdquo; feeling she began, &ldquo;Ethel, dear, wait,&rdquo;
       but Ethel was too impetuous to attend. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back in a twinkling,&rdquo; she
      called out, and down she flew, in her speed whisking away, without seeing
      it, the basket with Margaret&rsquo;s knitting and all her notes and papers,
      which lay scattered on the floor far out of reach, vexing Margaret at
      first, and then making her grieve at her own impatient feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel was soon in the drawing-room, but the right number of the magazine
      was not quickly forthcoming, and in searching she became embarked in
      another story. Just then, Aubrey, whose stout legs were apt to carry him
      into every part of the house where he was neither expected nor wanted,
      marched in at the open door, trying by dint of vehement gestures to make
      her understand, in his imperfect speech, something that he wanted. Very
      particularly troublesome she thought him, more especially as she could not
      make him out, otherwise than that he wanted her to do something with the
      newspaper and the fire. She made a boat for him with an old newspaper, a
      very hasty and frail performance, and told him to sail it on the carpet,
      and be Mr. Ernescliffe going away; and she thought him thus safely
      disposed of. Returning to her book and her search, with her face to the
      cupboard, and her book held up to catch the light, she was soon lost in
      her story, and thought of nothing more till suddenly roused by her
      father&rsquo;s voice in the hall, loud and peremptory with alarm, &ldquo;Aubrey! put
      that down!&rdquo; She looked, and beheld Aubrey brandishing a great flaming
      paper&mdash;he dropped it at the exclamation&mdash;it fell burning on the
      carpet. Aubrey&rsquo;s white pinafore! Ethel was springing up, but in her
      cramped, twisted position she could not do so quickly, and even as he
      called, her father strode by her, snatched at Aubrey&rsquo;s merino frock, which
      he crushed over the scarcely lighted pinafore, and trampled out the
      flaming paper with his foot. It was a moment of dreadful fright, but the
      next assured them that no harm was done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ethel!&rdquo; cried the doctor, &ldquo;Are you mad? What were you thinking of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aubrey, here recollecting himself enough to be frightened at his father&rsquo;s
      voice and manner, burst into loud cries; the doctor pressed him closer on
      his breast, caressed and soothed him. Ethel stood by, pale and transfixed
      with horror. Her father was more angry with her than she had ever seen
      him, and with reason, as she knew, as she smelled the singeing, and saw a
      large burnt hole in Aubrey&rsquo;s pinafore, while the front of his frock was
      scorched and brown. Dr. May&rsquo;s words were not needed, &ldquo;What could make you
      let him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see&mdash;&rdquo; she faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t see! Didn&rsquo;t look, didn&rsquo;t think, didn&rsquo;t care! That&rsquo;s it, Ethel.
      &lsquo;Tis very hard one can&rsquo;t trust you in a room with the child any more than
      the baby himself. His frock perfect tinder! He would have been burned to a
      cinder, if I had not come in!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aubrey roared afresh, and Dr. May, kissing and comforting him, gathered
      him up in his left arm, and carried him away, looking back at the door to
      say, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no bearing it! I&rsquo;ll put a stop to all schools and Greek, if
      it is to lead to this, and make you good for nothing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel was too much terrified to know where she was, or anything, but that
      she had let her little brother run into fearful peril, and grievously
      angered her father; she was afraid to follow him, and stood still,
      annihilated, and in despair, till roused by his return; then, with a
      stifled sob, she exclaimed, &ldquo;Oh, papa!&rdquo; and could get no further for a
      gush of tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the anger of the shock of terror was over, and Dr. May was sorry for
      her tears, though still he could not but manifest some displeasure. &ldquo;Yes,
      Ethel,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it was a frightful thing,&rdquo; and he could not but shudder
      again. &ldquo;One moment later! It is an escape to be for ever thankful for&mdash;poor
      little fellow!&mdash;but, Ethel, Ethel, do let it be a warning to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I hope&mdash;I&rsquo;ll try&mdash;&rdquo; sobbed Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have said you would try before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know I have,&rdquo; said Ethel, choked. &ldquo;If I could but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor child,&rdquo; said Dr. May sadly; then looking earnestly at her, &ldquo;Ethel,
      my dear, I am afraid of its being with you as&mdash;as it has been with
      me;&rdquo; he spoke very low, and drew her close to him. &ldquo;I grew up, thinking my
      inbred heedlessness a sort of grace, so to say, rather manly&mdash;the
      reverse of finikin. I was spoiled as a boy, and my Maggie carried on the
      spoiling, by never letting me feel its effects. By the time I had sense
      enough to regret this as a fault, I had grown too old for changing of
      ingrain, long-nurtured habits&mdash;perhaps I never wished it really. You
      have seen,&rdquo; and his voice was nearly inaudible, &ldquo;what my carelessness has
      come to&mdash;let that suffice at least, as a lesson that may spare you&mdash;what
      your father must feel as long as he lives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pressed his hand tightly on her shoulder, and left her, without letting
      her see his face. Shocked and bewildered, she hurried upstairs to
      Margaret. She threw herself on her knees, felt her arms round her, and
      heard her kind soothing, and then, in broken words, told how dreadful it
      had been, and how kind papa had been, and what he had said, which was now
      the uppermost thought. &ldquo;Oh, Margaret, Margaret, how very terrible it is!
      And does papa really think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe he does,&rdquo; whispered Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can he, can he bear it!&rdquo; said Ethel, clasping her hands. &ldquo;Oh! it is
      enough to kill one&mdash;I can&rsquo;t think why it did not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He bears it,&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;because he is so very good, that help and
      comfort do come to him. Dear papa! He bears up because it is right, and
      for our sakes, and he has a sort of rest in that perfect love they had for
      each other. He knows how she would wish him to cheer up and look to the
      end, and support and comfort are given to him, I know they are; but oh,
      Ethel! it does make one tremble and shrink, to think what he has been
      going through this autumn, especially when I hear him moving about late at
      night, and now and then comes a heavy groan&mdash;whenever any especial
      care has been on his mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel was in great distress. &ldquo;To have grieved him again!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and
      just as he seemed better and brighter! Everything I do turns out wrong,
      and always will; I can&rsquo;t do anything well by any chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes you can, when you mind what you are about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I never can&mdash;I&rsquo;m like him, every one says so, and he says the
      heedlessness is ingrain, and can&rsquo;t be got rid of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ethel, I don&rsquo;t really think he could have told you so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he said ingrain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I suppose it is part of his nature, and that you have inherited it,
      but&mdash;&rdquo; Margaret paused, and Ethel exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said his was long-nurtured; yes, Margaret, you guessed right, and he
      said he could not change it, and no more can I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely, Ethel, you have not had so many years. You are fifteen instead of
      forty-six, and it is more a woman&rsquo;s work than a man&rsquo;s to be careful. You
      need not begin to despair. You were growing much better; Richard said so,
      and so did Miss Winter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of it, if in one moment it is as bad as ever? And to-day,
      of all days in the year, just when papa had been so very, very kind, and
      given me more than I asked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, Ethel, I was thinking whether dear mamma would not say that
      was the reason. You were so happy, that perhaps you were thrown off your
      guard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should not wonder if that was it,&rdquo; said Ethel thoughtfully. &ldquo;You know
      it was a sort of probation that Richard put me on. I was to learn to be
      steady before he spoke to papa, and now it seemed to be all settled and
      right, and perhaps I forgot I was to be careful still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it was something of the kind. I was a little afraid before, and I
      wish I had tried to caution you, but I did not like to seem unkind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you had,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;Dear little Aubrey! Oh, if papa had not
      been there! And I cannot think how, as it was, he could contrive to put
      the fire out, with his one hand, and not hurt himself. Margaret it was
      terrible. How could I mind so little! Did you see how his frock was
      singed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, papa showed it to me. How can we be thankful enough! One thing I
      hope, that Aubrey was well frightened, poor little boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know! I see now!&rdquo; cried Ethel; &ldquo;he must have wanted me to make the fire
      blaze up, as Richard did one evening when we came in and found it low; I
      remember Aubrey clapping his hands and shouting at the flame; but my head
      was in that unhappy story, and I never had sense to put the things
      together, and reflect that he would try to do it himself. I only wanted to
      get him out of my way, dear little fellow. Oh, dear, how bad it was of me!
      All from being uplifted, and my head turned, as it used to be when we were
      happier. Oh! I wish Mr. Wilmot was not coming!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel sat for a long time with her head hidden in Margaret&rsquo;s pillows, and
      her hand clasped by her good elder sister. At last she looked up and said,
      &ldquo;Oh, Margaret, I am so unhappy. I see the whole meaning of it now. Do you
      not? When papa gave his consent at last, I was pleased and set up, and
      proud of my plans. I never recollected what a silly, foolish girl I am,
      and how unfit. I thought Mr. Wilmot would think great things of it&mdash;it
      was all wrong and self-satisfied. I never prayed at all that it might turn
      out well, and so now it won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest Ethel, I don&rsquo;t see that. Perhaps it will do all the better for
      your being humbled about it now. If you were wild and high flying, it
      would never go right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Its hope is in Richard,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it is,&rdquo; said Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish Mr. Wilmot was not coming to-night,&rdquo; said Ethel again. &ldquo;It would
      serve me right if papa were to say nothing about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel lingered with her sister till Harry and Mary came up with Margaret&rsquo;s
      tea, and summoned her, and she crept downstairs, and entered the room so
      quietly, that she was hardly perceived behind her boisterous brother. She
      knew her eyes were in no presentable state, and cast them down, and shrank
      back as Mr. Wilmot shook her hand and greeted her kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wilmot had been wont to come to tea whenever he had anything to say to
      Dr. or Mrs. May, which was about once in ten or twelve days. He was Mary&rsquo;s
      godfather, and their most intimate friend in the town, and he had often
      been with them, both as friend and clergyman, through their trouble&mdash;no
      later than Christmas Day, he had come to bring the feast of that day to
      Margaret in her sick-room. Indeed, it had been chiefly for the sake of the
      Mays that he had resolved to spend the holidays at Stoneborough, taking
      the care of Abbotstoke, while his brother, the vicar, went to visit their
      father. This was, however, the first time he had come in his old familiar
      way to spend an evening, and there was something in the resumption of
      former habits that painfully marked the change.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel, on coming in, found Flora making tea, her father leaning back in
      his great chair in silence, Richard diligently cutting bread, and Blanche
      sitting on Mr. Wilmot&rsquo;s knee, chattering fast and confidentially. Flora
      made Harry dispense the cups, and called every one to their places; Ethel
      timidly glanced at her father&rsquo;s face, as he rose and came into the light.
      She thought the lines and hollows were more marked than ever, and that he
      looked fatigued and mournful, and she felt cut to the heart; but he began
      to exert himself, and to make conversation, not, however, about Cocksmoor,
      but asking Mr. Wilmot what his brother thought of his new squire, Mr.
      Rivers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He likes him very much,&rdquo; said Mr. Wilmot. &ldquo;He is a very pleasing person,
      particularly kind-hearted and gentle, and likely to do a great deal for
      the parish. They have been giving away beef and blankets at a great rate
      this Christmas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What family is there?&rdquo; asked Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One daughter, about Ethel&rsquo;s age, is there with her governess. He has been
      twice married, and the first wife left a son, who is in the Dragoons, I
      believe. This girl&rsquo;s mother was Lord Cosham&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So the talk lingered on, without much interest or life. It was rather
      keeping from saying nothing than conversation, and no one was without the
      sensation that she was missing, round whom all had been free and joyous&mdash;not
      that she had been wont to speak much herself, but nothing would go on
      smoothly or easily without her. So long did this last, that Ethel began to
      think her father meant to punish her by not beginning the subject that
      night, and though she owned that she deserved it, she could not help being
      very much disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, however, her father began: &ldquo;We wanted you to talk over a scheme
      that these young ones have been concocting. You see, I am obliged to keep
      Richard at home this next term&mdash;it won&rsquo;t do to have no one in the
      house to carry poor Margaret. We can&rsquo;t do without him anyway, so he and
      Ethel have a scheme of seeing what can be done for that wretched place,
      Cocksmoor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said Mr. Wilmot, brightening and looking interested. &ldquo;It is
      sadly destitute. It would be a great thing if anything could be done for
      it. You have brought some children to school already, I think. I saw some
      rough-looking boys, who said they came from Cocksmoor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This embarked the doctor in the history of the ladies being too fine to
      teach the poor Cocksmoor girls, which he told with kindling vehemence and
      indignation, growing more animated every moment, as he stormed over the
      wonted subject of the bad system of management&mdash;ladies&rsquo; committee,
      negligent incumbent, insufficient clergy, misappropriated tithes&mdash;while
      Mr. Wilmot, who had mourned over it, within himself, a hundred times
      already, and was doing a curate&rsquo;s work on sufferance, with no pay, and
      little but mistrust from Mr. Ramsden, and absurd false reports among the
      more foolish part of the town, sat listening patiently, glad to hear the
      doctor in his old strain, though it was a hopeless matter for discussion,
      and Ethel dreaded that the lamentation would go on till bedtime, and
      Cocksmoor be quite forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a time they came safely back to the project, and Richard was called
      on to explain. Ethel left it all to him, and he with rising colour, and
      quiet, unhesitating, though diffident manner, detailed designs that showed
      themselves to have been well matured. Mr. Wilmot heard, cordially
      approved, and, as all agreed that no time was to be lost, while the
      holidays lasted, he undertook to speak to Mr. Ramsden on the subject the
      next morning, and if his consent to their schemes could be gained, to come
      in the afternoon to walk with Richard and Ethel to Cocksmoor, and set
      their affairs in order. All the time Ethel said not a word, except when
      referred to by her brother; but when Mr. Wilmot took leave, he shook her
      hand warmly, as if he was much pleased with her. &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;if he
      knew how ill I have behaved! It is all show and hollowness with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not know that Mr. Wilmot thought her silence one of the best signs
      for the plan, nor how much more doubtful he would have thought her
      perseverance, if he had seen her wild and vehement. As it was, he was very
      much pleased, and when the doctor came out with him into the hall, he
      could not help expressing his satisfaction in Richard&rsquo;s well-judged and
      sensibly-described project.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, ay!&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s much more in the boy than I used to
      think. He&rsquo;s a capital fellow, and more like his mother than any of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is,&rdquo; said Mr. Wilmot; &ldquo;there was a just, well-weighed sense and
      soberness in his plans that put me in mind of her every moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. May gave his hand a squeeze, full of feeling, and went up to tell
      Margaret. She, on the first opportunity, told Richard, and made him
      happier than he had been for months, not so much in Mr. Wilmot&rsquo;s words, as
      in his father&rsquo;s assent to, and pleasure in them.

    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Pitch thy behaviour low, thy projects high,
       So shalt thou humble and magnanimous be;
     Sink not in spirit; who aimeth at the sky
       Shoots higher much than he that means a tree.
         A grain of glory mixed with humbleness,
         Cures both a fever and lethargicness.

</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Norman, do you feel up to a long day&rsquo;s work?&rdquo; said Dr. May, on the
      following morning. &ldquo;I have to set off after breakfast to see old Mrs.
      Gould, and to be at Abbotstoke Grange by twelve; then I thought of going
      to Fordholm, and getting Miss Cleveland to give us some luncheon&mdash;there
      are some poor people on the way to look at; and that girl on Far-view
      Hill; and there&rsquo;s another place to call in at coming home. You&rsquo;ll have a
      good deal of sitting in the carriage, holding Whitefoot, so if you think
      you shall be cold or tired, don&rsquo;t scruple to say so, and I&rsquo;ll take Adams
      to drive me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; said Norman briskly. &ldquo;This frost is famous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will turn to rain, I expect&mdash;it is too white,&rdquo; said the doctor,
      looking out at the window. &ldquo;How will you get to Cocksmoor, good people?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ethel won&rsquo;t believe it rains unless it is very bad,&rdquo; said Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norman set out with his father, and prosperously performed the expedition,
      arriving at Abbotstoke Grange at the appointed hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; said the doctor, as the iron gates of ornamental scrollwork were
      swung back, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a considerable change in this place since I was here
      last. Well kept up indeed! Not a dead leaf left under the old walnuts, and
      the grass looks as smooth as if they had a dozen gardeners rolling it
      every day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the drive,&rdquo; said Norman, &ldquo;more like a garden walk than a road! But
      oh! what a splendid cedar!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it! I remember that as long as I remember anything. All this fine
      rolling of turf, and trimming up of the place, does not make much
      difference to you, old fellow, does it? You don&rsquo;t look altered since I saw
      you last, when old Jervis was letting the place go to rack and ruin. So
      they have a new entrance&mdash;very handsome conservatory&mdash;flowers&mdash;the
      banker does things in style. There,&rdquo; as Norman helped him off with his
      plaid, &ldquo;wrap yourself up well, don&rsquo;t get cold. The sun is gone in, and I
      should not wonder if the rain were coming after all. I&rsquo;ll not be longer
      than I can help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. May disappeared from his son&rsquo;s sight through the conservatory, where,
      through the plate-glass, the exotics looked so fresh and perfumy, that
      Norman almost fancied that the scent reached him. &ldquo;How much poor Margaret
      would enjoy one of those camellias,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;and these people have
      bushels of them for mere show. If I were papa, I should be tempted to be
      like Beauty&rsquo;s father, and carry off one. How she would admire it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norman had plenty of time to meditate on the camellias, and then to turn
      and speculate on the age of the cedar, whether it could have been planted
      by the monks of Stoneborough Abbey, to whom the Grange had belonged,
      brought from Lebanon by a pilgrim, perhaps; and then he tried to guess at
      the longevity of cedars, and thought of asking Margaret, the botanist of
      the family. Then he yawned, moved the horse a little about, opined that
      Mr. Rivers must be very prosy, or have some abstruse complaint, considered
      the sky, and augured rain, buttoned another button of his rough coat, and
      thought of Miss Cleveland&rsquo;s dinner. Then he thought there was a very sharp
      wind, and drove about till he found a sheltered place on the lee side of
      the great cedar, looked up at it, and thought it would be a fine subject
      for verses, if Mr. Wilmot knew of it, and then proceeded to consider what
      he should make of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst he was suddenly roused by the deep-toned note of a dog, and
      beheld a large black Newfoundland dog leaping about the horse in great
      indignation. &ldquo;Rollo! Rollo!&rdquo; called a clear young voice, and he saw two
      ladles returning from a walk. Rollo, at the first call, galloped back to
      his mistress, and was evidently receiving an admonition, and promising
      good behaviour. The two ladies entered the house, while he lay down on the
      step, with his lion-like paw hanging down, watching Norman with a
      brilliant pair of hazel eyes. Norman, after a little more wondering when
      Mr. Rivers would have done with his father, betook himself to civil
      demonstrations to the creature, who received them with dignity, and
      presently, after acknowledging with his tail, various whispers of &ldquo;Good
      old fellow,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Here, old Rollo!&rdquo; having apparently satisfied himself
      that the young gentleman was respectable, he rose, and vouchsafed to stand
      up with his forepaws in the gig, listening amiably to Norman&rsquo;s delicate
      flatteries. Norman even began to hope to allure him into jumping on the
      seat: but a great bell rang, and Rollo immediately turned round, and
      dashed off, at full speed, to some back region of the house. &ldquo;So, old
      fellow, you know what the dinner-bell means,&rdquo; thought Norman. &ldquo;I hope Mr.
      Rivers is hungry too. Miss Cleveland will have eaten up her whole
      luncheon, if this old bore won&rsquo;t let my father go soon! I hope he is
      desperately ill&mdash;&lsquo;tis his only excuse! Heigh ho! I must jump out to
      warm my feet soon! There, there&rsquo;s a drop of rain! Well, there&rsquo;s no end to
      it! I wonder what Ethel is doing about Cocksmoor! It is setting in for a
      wet afternoon!&rdquo; and Norman disconsolately put up his umbrella.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Dr. May and another gentleman were seen in the conservatory, and
      Norman gladly proceeded to clear the seat; but Dr. May called out, &ldquo;Jump
      out, Norman, Mr. Rivers is so kind as to ask us to stay to luncheon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With boyish shrinking from strangers, Norman privately wished Mr. Rivers
      at Jericho, as he gave the reins to a servant, and entered the
      conservatory, where a kindly hand was held out to him by a gentleman of
      about fifty, with a bald smooth forehead, soft blue eyes, and gentle
      pleasant face. &ldquo;Is this your eldest son?&rdquo; said he, turning to Dr. May&mdash;and
      the manner of both was as if they were already well acquainted. &ldquo;No, this
      is my second. The eldest is not quite such a long-legged fellow,&rdquo; said Dr.
      May. And then followed the question addressed to Norman himself, where he
      was at school.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Stoneborough,&rdquo; said Norman, a little amused at the thought how angry
      Ethel and Harry would be that the paragraph of the county paper, where &ldquo;N.
      W. May&rdquo; was recorded as prizeman and foremost in the examination, had not
      penetrated even to Abbotstoke Grange, or rather to its owner&rsquo;s memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, his father could not help adding, &ldquo;He is the head of the school&mdash;a
      thing we Stoneborough men think much of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This, and Mr. Rivers&rsquo;s civil answer, made Norman so hot, that he did not
      notice much in passing through a hall full of beautiful vases, stuffed
      birds, busts, etc., tastefully arranged, and he did not look up till they
      were entering a handsome dining-room, where a small square table was laid
      out for luncheon near a noble fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two ladies were there, and Mr. Rivers introduced them as his daughter
      and Mrs. Larpent. It was the most luxurious meal that Norman had ever
      seen, the plate, the porcelain, and all the appointments of the table so
      elegant, and the viands, all partaking of the Christmas character, and of
      a recherche delicate description quite new to him. He had to serve as his
      father&rsquo;s right hand, and was so anxious to put everything as Dr. May liked
      it, and without attracting notice, that he hardly saw or listened till Dr.
      May began to admire a fine Claude on the opposite wall, and embarked in a
      picture discussion. The doctor had much taste for art, and had made the
      most of his opportunities of seeing paintings during his time of study at
      Paris, and in a brief tour to Italy. Since that time, few good pictures
      had come in his way, and these were a great pleasure to him, while Mr.
      Rivers, a regular connoisseur, was delighted to meet with one who could so
      well appreciate them. Norman perceived how his father was enjoying the
      conversation, and was much interested both by the sight of the first fine
      paintings he had ever seen, and by the talk about their merits; but the
      living things in the room had more of his attention and observation,
      especially the young lady who sat at the head of the table; a girl about
      his own age; she was on a very small scale, and seemed to him like a
      fairy, in the airy lightness and grace of her movements, and the blithe
      gladsomeness of her gestures and countenance. Form and features, though
      perfectly healthful and brisk, had the peculiar finish and delicacy of a
      miniature painting, and were enhanced by the sunny glance of her dark soft
      smiling eyes. Her hair was in black silky braids, and her dress, with its
      gaiety of well-assorted colour, was positively refreshing to his eye, so
      long accustomed to the deep mourning of his sisters. A little Italian
      greyhound, perfectly white, was at her side, making infinite variations of
      the line of beauty and grace, with its elegant outline, and S-like tail,
      as it raised its slender nose in hopes of a fragment of bread which she
      from time to time dispensed to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luncheon over, Mr. Rivers asked Dr. May to step into his library, and
      Norman guessed that they had been talking all this time, and had never
      come to the medical opinion. However, a good meal and a large fire made a
      great difference in his toleration, and it was so new a scene, that he had
      no objection to a prolonged waiting, especially when Mrs. Larpent said, in
      a very pleasant tone, &ldquo;Will you come into the drawing-room with us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He felt somewhat as if he was walking in enchanted ground as he followed
      her into the large room, the windows opening into the conservatory, the
      whole air fragrant with flowers, the furniture and ornaments so exquisite
      of their kind, and all such a fit scene for the beautiful little damsel,
      who, with her slender dog by her side, tripped on demurely, and rather
      shyly, but with a certain skipping lightness in her step. A very tall
      overgrown schoolboy did Norman feel himself for one bashful moment, when
      he found himself alone with the two ladies; but he was ready to be set at
      ease by Mrs. Larpent&rsquo;s good-natured manner, when she said something of
      Rollo&rsquo;s discourtesy. He smiled, and answered that he had made great
      friends with the fine old dog, and spoke of his running off to the dinner,
      at which little Miss Rivers laughed, and looked delighted, and began to
      tell of Rollo&rsquo;s perfections and intelligence. Norman ventured to inquire
      the name of the little Italian, and was told it was Nipen, because it had
      once stolen a cake, much like the wind-spirit in Feats on the Fiord. Its
      beauty and tricks were duly displayed, and a most beautiful Australian
      parrot was exhibited, Mrs. Larpent taking full interest in the talk, in so
      lively and gentle a manner, and she and her pretty pupil evidently on such
      sister-like terms, that Norman could hardly believe her to be the
      governess, when he thought of Miss Winter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Rivers took up some brown leaves which she was cutting out with
      scissors, and shaping. &ldquo;Our holiday work,&rdquo; said Mrs. Larpent, in answer to
      the inquiring look of Norman&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;Meta has been making a drawing for
      her papa, and is framing it in leather-work. Have you ever seen any?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; and Norman looked eagerly, asking questions, and watching while
      Miss Rivers cut out her ivy leaf and marked its veins, and showed how she
      copied it from nature. He thanked her, saying, &ldquo;I wanted to learn all
      about it, for I thought it would be such nice work for my eldest sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A glance of earnest interest from little Meta&rsquo;s bright eyes at her
      governess, and Mrs. Larpent, in a kind, soft tone that quite gained his
      heart, asked, &ldquo;Is she the invalid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Norman. &ldquo;New fancy work is a great gain to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Larpent&rsquo;s sympathetic questions, and Meta&rsquo;s softening eyes, gradually
      drew from him a great deal about Margaret&rsquo;s helpless state, and her
      patience, and capabilities, and how every one came to her with all their
      cares; and Norman, as he spoke, mentally contrasted the life, untouched by
      trouble and care, led by the fair girl before him, with that atmosphere of
      constant petty anxieties round her namesake&rsquo;s couch, at years so nearly
      the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How very good she must be,&rdquo; said little Meta, quickly and softly; and a
      tear was sparkling on her eyelashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is indeed,&rdquo; said Norman earnestly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what papa would do
      but for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Larpent asked kind questions whether his father&rsquo;s arm was very
      painful, and the hopes of its cure; and he felt as if she was a great
      friend already. Thence they came to books. Norman had not read for months
      past, but it happened that Meta was just now reading Woodstock, with which
      he was of course familiar; and both grew eager in discussing that and
      several others. Of one, Meta spoke in such terms of delight, that Norman
      thought it had been very stupid of him to let it lie on the table for the
      last fortnight without looking into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was almost sorry to see his father and Mr. Rivers come in, and hear the
      carriage ordered, but they were not off yet, though the rain was now only
      Scotch mist. Mr. Rivers had his most choice little pictures still to
      display, his beautiful early Italian masters, finished like illuminations,
      and over these there was much lingering and admiring. Meta had whispered
      something to her governess, who smiled, and advanced to Norman. &ldquo;Meta
      wishes to know if your sister would like to have a few flowers?&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner said than done; the door into the conservatory was opened, and
      Meta, cutting sprays of beautiful geranium, delicious heliotrope, fragrant
      calycanthus, deep blue tree violet, and exquisite hothouse ferns; perfect
      wonders to Norman, who, at each addition to the bouquet, exclaimed by
      turns, &ldquo;Oh, thank you!&rdquo; and, &ldquo;How she will like it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her father reached a magnolia blossom from on high, and the quick warm
      grateful emotion trembled in Dr. May&rsquo;s features and voice, as he said, &ldquo;It
      is very kind in you; you have given my poor girl a great treat. Thank you
      with all my heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret Rivers cast down her eyes, half smiled, and shrank back, thinking
      she had never felt anything like the left-handed grasp, so full of warmth
      and thankfulness. It gave her confidence to venture on the one question on
      which she was bent. Her father was in the hall, showing Norman his Greek
      nymph; and lifting her eyes to Dr. May&rsquo;s face, then casting them down, she
      coloured deeper than ever, as she said, in a stammering whisper, &ldquo;Oh,
      please&mdash;if you would tell me&mdash;do you think&mdash;is papa very
      ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. May answered in his softest, most reassuring tones: &ldquo;You need not be
      alarmed about him, I assure you. You must keep him from too much
      business,&rdquo; he added, smiling; &ldquo;make him ride with you, and not let him
      tire himself, and I am sure you can be his best doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But do you think,&rdquo; said Meta, earnestly looking up&mdash;&ldquo;do you think he
      will be quite well again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not expect doctors to be absolute oracles,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I will
      tell you what I told him&mdash;I hardly think his will ever be sound
      health again, but I see no reason why he should not have many years of
      comfort, and there is no cause for you to disquiet yourself on his account&mdash;you
      have only to be careful of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meta tried to say &ldquo;thank you,&rdquo; but not succeeding, looked imploringly at
      her governess, who spoke for her. &ldquo;Thank you, it is a great relief to have
      an opinion, for we were not at all satisfied about Mr. Rivers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A few words more, and Meta was skipping about like a sprite finding a
      basket for the flowers&mdash;she had another shake of the hand, another
      grateful smile, and &ldquo;thank you,&rdquo; from the doctor; and then, as the
      carriage disappeared, Mrs. Larpent exclaimed, &ldquo;What a very nice
      intelligent boy that was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Particularly gentlemanlike,&rdquo; said Mr. Rivers. &ldquo;Very clever&mdash;the head
      of the school, as his father tells me&mdash;and so modest and unassuming&mdash;though
      I see his father is very proud of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am sure they are so fond of each other,&rdquo; said Meta: &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t you see
      his attentive ways to his father at luncheon! And, papa, I am sure you
      must like Dr. May, Mr. Wilmot&rsquo;s doctor, as much as I said you would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is the most superior man I have met with for a long time,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Rivers. &ldquo;It is a great acquisition to find a man of such taste and
      acquirements in this country neighbourhood, when there is not another who
      can tell a Claude from a Poussin. I declare, when once we began talking,
      there was no leaving off&mdash;I have not met a person of so much
      conversation since I left town. I thought you would like to see him,
      Meta.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope I shall know the Miss Mays some time or other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the prettiest little fairy I ever did see!&rdquo; was Dr. May&rsquo;s remark,
      as Norman drove from the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How good-natured they are!&rdquo; said Norman; &ldquo;I just said something about
      Margaret, and she gave me all these flowers. How Margaret will be
      delighted! I wish the girls could see it all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you got on well with the ladies, did you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were very kind to me. It was very pleasant!&rdquo; said Norman, with a
      tone of enjoyment that did his father&rsquo;s heart good.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was glad you should come in. Such a curiosity shop is a sight, and
      those pictures were some of them well worth seeing. That was a splendid
      Titian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That cast of the Pallas of the Parthenon&mdash;how beautiful it was&mdash;I
      knew it from the picture in Smith&rsquo;s dictionary. Mr. Rivers said he would
      show me all his antiques if you would bring me again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw he liked your interest in them. He is a good, kind-hearted
      dilettante sort of old man; he has got all the talk of the literary,
      cultivated society in London, and must find it dullish work here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You liked him, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is very pleasant; I found he knew my old friend, Benson, whom I had
      not seen since we were at Cambridge together, and we got on that and other
      matters; London people have an art of conversation not learned here, and I
      don&rsquo;t know how the time slipped away; but you must have been tolerably
      tired of waiting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to signify,&rdquo; said Norman. &ldquo;I only began to think he must be very ill;
      I hope there is not much the matter with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say. I am afraid there is organic disease, but I think it may be
      kept quiet a good while yet, and he may have a pleasant life for some time
      to come, arranging his prints, and petting his pretty daughter. He has
      plenty to fall back upon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you go there again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, next week. I am glad of it. I shall like to have another look at
      that little Madonna of his&mdash;it is the sort of picture that does one
      good to carry away in one&rsquo;s eye. Whay! Stop. There&rsquo;s an old woman in here.
      It is too late for Fordholm, but these cases won&rsquo;t wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went into the cottage, and soon returned, saying, &ldquo;Fine new blankets,
      and a great kettle of soup, and such praises of the ladies at the Grange!&rdquo;
       And, at the next house, it was the same story. &ldquo;Well, &lsquo;tis no mockery now
      to tell the poor creatures they want nourishing food. Slices of meat and
      bottles of port wine rain down on Abbotstoke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A far more talkative journey than usual ensued; the discussion of the
      paintings and antiques was almost equally delightful to the father and
      son, and lasted till, about a mile from Stoneborough, they descried three
      figures in the twilight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! How are you, Wilmot? So you braved the rain, Ethel. Jump in,&rdquo; called
      the doctor, as Norman drew up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall crowd you&mdash;I shall hurt your arm, papa; thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you won&rsquo;t&mdash;jump in&mdash;there&rsquo;s room for three thread-papers in
      one gig. Why, Wilmot, your brother has a very jewel of a squire! How did
      you fare?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well on the whole,&rdquo; was Mr. Wllmot&rsquo;s answer, while Ethel scrambled
      in, and tried to make herself small, an art in which she was not very
      successful; and Norman gave an exclamation of horrified warning, as she
      was about to step into the flower-basket; then she nearly tumbled out
      again in dismay, and was relieved to find herself safely wedged in,
      without having done any harm, while her father called out to Mr. Wilmot,
      as they started, &ldquo;I say! You are coming back to tea with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That cheerful tone, and the kindness to herself, were a refreshment and
      revival to Ethel, who was still sobered and shocked by her yesterday&rsquo;s
      adventure, and by the sense of her father&rsquo;s sorrowful displeasure.
      Expecting further to be scolded for getting in so awkwardly, she did not
      venture to volunteer anything, and even when he kindly said, &ldquo;I hope you
      were prosperous in your expedition,&rdquo; she only made answer, in a very grave
      voice, &ldquo;Yes, papa, we have taken a very nice tidy room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you pay for it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fourpence for each time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, here&rsquo;s for you,&rdquo; said Dr. May. &ldquo;It is only two guineas to-day; that
      banker at the Grange beguiled us of our time, but you had better close the
      bargain for him, Ethel&mdash;he will be a revenue for you, for this winter
      at least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, thank you, papa,&rdquo; was all Ethel could say; overpowered by his
      kindness, and more repressed by what she felt so unmerited, than she would
      have been by coldness, she said few words, and preferred listening to
      Norman, who began to describe their adventures at the Grange.
    </p>
    <p>
      All her eagerness revived, however, as she sprang out of the carriage,
      full of tidings for Margaret; and it was almost a race between her and
      Norman to get upstairs, and unfold their separate budgets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret&rsquo;s lamp had just been lighted, when they made their entrance,
      Norman holding the flowers on high.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how beautiful! how delicious! For me? Where did you get them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From Abbotstoke Grange; Miss Rivers sent them to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How very kind! What a lovely geranium, and oh, that fern! I never saw
      anything so choice. How came she to think of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They asked me in because it rained, and she was making the prettiest
      things, leather leaves and flowers for picture frames. I thought it was
      work that would just suit you, and learned how to do it. That made them
      ask about you, and it ended by her sending you this nosegay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How very kind everybody is! Well, Ethel, are you come home too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa picked me up. Oh, Margaret, we have found such a nice room, a clean
      sanded kitchen&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never saw such a conservatory&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it is to be let to us for fourpence a time&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The house is full of beautiful things, pictures and statues. Only think
      of a real Titian, and a cast of the Apollo!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty children to begin with, and Richard is going to make some forms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Rivers is going to show me all his casts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, is he? But only think how lucky we were to find such a nice woman;
      Mr. Wilmot was so pleased with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norman found one story at a time was enough, and relinquished the field,
      contenting himself with silently helping Margaret to arrange the flowers,
      holding the basket for her, and pleased with her gestures of admiration.
      Ethel went on with her history. &ldquo;The first place we thought of would not
      do at all; the woman said she would not take half-a-crown a week to have a
      lot of children stabbling about, as she called it; so we went to another
      house, and there was a very nice woman indeed, Mrs. Green, with one little
      boy, whom she wanted to send to school, only it is too far. She says she
      always goes to church at Fordholm because it is nearer, and she is quite
      willing to let us have the room. So we settled it, and next Friday we are
      to begin. Papa has given us two guineas, and that will pay for, let me
      see, a hundred and twenty-six times, and Mr. Wilmot is going to give us
      some books, and Ritchie will print some alphabets. We told a great many of
      the people, and they are so glad. Old Granny Hall said, &lsquo;Well, I never!&rsquo;
      and told the girls they must be as good as gold now the gentlefolks was
      coming to teach them. Mr. Wilmot is coming with us every Friday as long as
      the holidays last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel departed on her father&rsquo;s coming in to ask Margaret if she would like
      to have a visit from Mr. Wilmot. She enjoyed this very much, and he sat
      there nearly an hour, talking of many matters, especially the Cocksmoor
      scheme, on which she was glad to hear his opinion at first hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very glad you think well of it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It is most desirable
      that something should be done for those poor people, and Richard would
      never act rashly; but I have longed for advice whether it was right to
      promote Ethel&rsquo;s undertaking. I suppose Richard told you how bent on it she
      was, long before papa was told of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said it was her great wish, and had been so for a long time past.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret, in words more adequate to express the possession the project had
      gained of Ethel&rsquo;s ardent mind, explained the whole history of it. &ldquo;I do
      believe she looks on it as a sort of call,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and I have felt as
      if I ought not to hinder her, and yet I did not know whether it was right,
      at her age, to let her undertake so much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; said Mr. Wilmot, &ldquo;but, from what I have seen of Ethel, I
      should think you had decided rightly. There seems to me to be such a
      spirit of energy in her, that if she does not act, she will either
      speculate and theorise, or pine and prey on herself. I do believe that
      hard homely work, such as this school-keeping, is the best outlet for what
      might otherwise run to extravagance&mdash;more especially as you say the
      hope of it has already been an incentive to improvement in home duties.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I am sure it has,&rdquo; said Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Moreover,&rdquo; said Mr. Wilmot, &ldquo;I think you were quite right in thinking
      that to interfere with such a design was unsafe. I do believe that a great
      deal of harm is done by prudent friends, who dread to let young people do
      anything out of the common way, and so force their aspirations to ferment
      and turn sour, for want of being put to use.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still girls are told they ought to wait patiently, and not to be eager
      for self-imposed duties.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not saying that it is not the appointed discipline for the girls
      themselves,&rdquo; said Mr. Wilmot. &ldquo;If they would submit, and do their best, it
      would doubtless prove the most beneficial thing for them; but it is a
      trial in which they often fail, and I had rather not be in the place of
      such friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a great puzzle!&rdquo; said Margaret, sighing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I dare say you are often perplexed,&rdquo; said her friend kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I am. There are so many little details that I cannot be always
      teasing papa with, and yet which I do believe form the character more than
      the great events, and I never know whether I act for the best. And there
      are so many of us, so many duties, I cannot half attend to any. Lately, I
      have been giving up almost everything to keep this room quiet for Norman
      in the morning, because he was so much harassed and hurt by bustle and
      confusion, and I found to-day that things have gone wrong in consequence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must do the best you can, and try to trust that while you work in the
      right spirit, your failures will be compensated,&rdquo; said Mr. Wilmot. &ldquo;It is
      a hard trial.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like your understanding it,&rdquo; said Margaret, smiling sadly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      know whether it is silly, but I don&rsquo;t like to be pitied for the wrong
      thing. My being so helpless is what every one laments over; but, after
      all, that is made up to me by the petting and kindness I get from all of
      them; but it is the being mistress of the house, and having to settle for
      every one, without knowing whether I do right or wrong, that is my
      trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not sure, however, that it is right to call it a trouble, though it
      is a trial.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see what you mean,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;I ought to be thankful. I know it
      is an honour, and I am quite sure I should be grieved if they did not all
      come to me and consult me as they do. I had better not have complained,
      and yet I am glad I did, for I like you to understand my difficulties.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, indeed, I wish to enter into them, and do or say anything in my
      power to help you. But I don&rsquo;t know anything that can be of so much
      comfort as the knowledge that He who laid the burden on you, will help you
      to bear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Margaret, pausing; and then, with a sweet look, though a heavy
      sigh, she said, &ldquo;It is very odd how things turn out! I always had a
      childish fancy that I would be useful and important, but I little thought
      how it would be! However, as long as Richard is in the house, I always
      feel secure about the others, and I shall soon be downstairs myself. Don&rsquo;t
      you think dear papa in better spirits?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought so to-day,&rdquo;&mdash;and here the doctor returned, talking of
      Abbotstoke Grange, where he had certainly been much pleased. &ldquo;It was a
      lucky chance,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that they brought Norman in. It was exactly what
      I wanted to rouse and interest him, and he took it all in so well, that I
      am sure they were pleased with him. I thought he looked a very lanky
      specimen of too much leg and arm when I called him in, but he has such
      good manners, and is so ready and understanding, that they could not help
      liking him. It was fortunate I had him instead of Richard&mdash;Ritchie is
      a very good fellow, certainly, but he had rather look at a steam-engine,
      any day, than at Raphael himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norman had his turn by-and-by. He came up after tea, reporting that papa
      was fast asleep in his chair, and the others would go on about Cocksmoor
      till midnight, if they were let alone; and made up for his previous
      yielding to Ethel, by giving, with much animation, and some excitement, a
      glowing description of the Grange, so graphic, that Margaret said she
      could almost fancy she had been there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Margaret, I wonder if you ever will! I would give something for you
      to see the beautiful conservatory. It is a real bower for a maiden of
      romance, with its rich green fragrance in the midst of winter. It is like
      a picture in a dream. One could imagine it a fairy land, where no care, or
      grief, or weariness could come, all choice beauty and sweetness waiting on
      the creature within. I can hardly believe that it is a real place, and
      that I have seen it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Though you have brought these pretty tokens that your fairy is as good as
      she is fair!&rdquo; said Margaret, smiling.

    <p>
      In a large family it must often happen, that since every member of it
      cannot ride the same hobby, nor at the same time, their several steeds
      must sometimes run counter to each other; and so Ethel found it, one
      morning when Miss Winter, having a bad cold, had given her an unwonted
      holiday.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wilmot had sent a large parcel of books for her to choose from for
      Cocksmoor, but this she could not well do without consultation. The
      multitude bewildered her, she was afraid of taking too many or too few,
      and the being brought to these practical details made her sensible that
      though her schemes were very grand and full for future doings, they passed
      very lightly over the intermediate ground. The Paulo post fulurum was a
      period much more developed in her imagination than the future, that the
      present was flowing into.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where was her coadjutor, Richard? Writing notes for papa, and not to be
      disturbed. She had better have waited tranquilly, but this would not suit
      her impatience, and she ran up to Margaret&rsquo;s room. There she found a great
      display of ivy leaves, which Norman, who had been turning half the shops
      in the town upside down in search of materials, was instructing her to
      imitate in leather-work&mdash;a regular mania with him, and apparently the
      same with Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      In came Ethel. &ldquo;Oh, Margaret, will you look at these &lsquo;First Truths?&rsquo; Do
      you think they would be easy enough? Shall I take some of the Parables and
      Miracles at once, or content myself with the book about &lsquo;Jane Sparks?&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s some very easy reading in &lsquo;Jane Sparks&rsquo;, isn&rsquo;t there? I would not
      make the little books from the New Testament too common.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care, that leaf has five points,&rdquo; said Norman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I bring you up &lsquo;Jane Sparks&rsquo; to see? Because then you can judge,&rdquo;
       said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, Norman, is that right?&mdash;what a beauty! I should like to look
      over them by-and-by, dear Ethel, very much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel gazed and went away, more put out than was usual with her. &ldquo;When
      Margaret has a new kind of fancy work,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;she cares for
      nothing else! as if my poor children did not signify more than trumpery
      leather leaves!&rdquo; She next met Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Flora, see here, what a famous parcel of books Mr. Wilmot has sent us
      to choose from.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All those!&rdquo; said Flora, turning them over as they lay heaped on the
      drawing-room sofa; &ldquo;what a confusion!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See, such a parcel of reading books. I want to know what you think of
      setting them up with &lsquo;Jane Sparks&rsquo;, as it is week-day teaching.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be very tired of hearing those spelled over for ever; they have
      some nicer books at the national school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the name of them? Do you see any of them here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think I do, but I can&rsquo;t wait to look now. I must write some
      letters. You had better put them together a little. If you were to sort
      them, you would know what is there. Now, what a mess they are in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel could not deny it, and began to deal them out in piles, looking
      somewhat more fitting, but still felt neglected and aggrieved, at no one
      being at leisure but Harry, who was not likely to be of any use to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently she heard the study door open, and hoped; but though it was
      Richard who entered the room, he was followed by Tom, and each held
      various books that boded little good to her. Miss Winter had, much to her
      own satisfaction, been relieved from the charge of Tom, whose lessons
      Richard had taken upon himself; and thus Ethel had heard so little about
      them for a long time past, that even in her vexation and desire to have
      them over, she listened with interest, desirous to judge what sort of
      place Tom might be likely to take in school.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not perceive that this made Richard nervous and uneasy. He had a
      great dislike to spectators of Latin lessons; he never had forgotten an
      unlucky occasion, some years back, when his father was examining him in
      the Georgics, and he, dull by nature, and duller by confusion and
      timidity, had gone on rendering word for word&mdash;enim for, seges a
      crop, lini of mud, urit burns, campum the field, avenae a crop of pipe,
      urit burns it; when Norman and Ethel had first warned him of the beauty of
      his translation by an explosion of laughing, when his father had shut the
      book with a bounce, shaken his head in utter despair, and told him to give
      up all thoughts of doing anything&mdash;and when Margaret had cried with
      vexation. Since that time, he had never been happy when any one was in
      earshot of a lesson; but to-day he had no escape&mdash;Harry lay on the
      rug reading, and Ethel sat forlorn over her books on the sofa. Tom,
      however, was bright enough, declined his Greek nouns irreproachably, and
      construed his Latin so well, that Ethel could not help putting in a word
      or two of commendation, and auguring the third form. &ldquo;Do let him off the
      parsing, Ritchie,&rdquo; said she coaxingly&mdash;&ldquo;he has said it so well, and I
      want you so much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid I must not,&rdquo; said Richard; who, to her surprise, did not look
      pleased or satisfied with the prosperous translation; &ldquo;but come, Tom, you
      shan&rsquo;t have many words, if you really know them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom twisted and looked rather cross, but when asked to parse the word
      viribus, answered readily and correctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, only two more&mdash;affuit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Third person singular, praeter perfect tense of the verb affo, affis,
      affui, affere,&rdquo; gabbled off Tom with such confidence, that though Ethel
      gave an indignant jump, Richard was almost startled into letting it pass,
      and disbelieving himself. He remonstrated in a somewhat hesitating voice.
      &ldquo;Did you find that in the dictionary?&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I thought affui came from
      adsum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, to be sure, stupid fool of a word, so it does!&rdquo; said Tom hastily. &ldquo;I
      had forgot&mdash;adsum, ades, affui, adesse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard said no more, but proposed the word oppositus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adjective.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel was surprised, for she remembered that it was, in this passage, part
      of a passive verb, which Tom had construed correctly, &ldquo;it was objected,&rdquo;
       and she had thought this very creditable to him, whereas he now evidently
      took it for opposite; however, on Richard&rsquo;s reading the line, he corrected
      himself and called it a participle, but did not commit himself further,
      till asked for its derivation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From oppositor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; cried Harry, who hitherto had been abstracted in his book, but
      now turned, raised himself on his elbow, and, at the blunder, shook his
      thick yellow locks, and showed his teeth like a young lion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, now, Tom, pay attention,&rdquo; said Richard resignedly. &ldquo;If you found out
      its meaning, you must have seen its derivation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oppositus,&rdquo; said Tom, twisting his fingers, and gazing first at Ethel,
      then at Harry, in hopes of being prompted, then at the ceiling and floor,
      the while he drawled out the word with a whine, &ldquo;why, oppositus from
      op-posor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A poser! ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Harry, you distract him,&rdquo; said Richard. &ldquo;Come, Tom, say at once
      whether you know it or not&mdash;it is of no use to invent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From op-&rdquo; and a mumble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? I don&rsquo;t hear&mdash;op&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom again looked for help to Harry, who made a mischievous movement of his
      lips, as if prompting, and, deceived by it, he said boldly, &ldquo;From
      op-possum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right! let us hear him decline it!&rdquo; cried Harry, in an ecstasy.
      &ldquo;Oppossum, opottis, opposse, or oh-pottery!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harry,&rdquo; said Richard, in a gentle reasonable voice, &ldquo;I wish you would be
      so kind as not to stay, if you cannot help distracting him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Harry, who really had a tolerable share of forbearance and
      consideration, actually obeyed, contenting himself with tossing his book
      into the air and catching it again, while he paused at the door to give
      his last unsolicited assistance. &ldquo;Decline oppossum you say. I&rsquo;ll tell you
      how: O-possum re-poses up a gum tree. O-pot-you-I will, says the O-posse
      of Yankees, come out to ketch him. Opossum poses them and declines in
      O-pot-esse by any manner of means of o-potting-di-do-dum, was quite
      oppositum-oppotitu, in fact, quite contrairy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard, with the gravity of a victim, heard this sally of schoolboy wit,
      which threw Ethel back on the sofa in fits of laughing, and declaring that
      the Opossum declined, not that he was declined; but, in the midst of the
      disturbance thus created, Tom stepped up to her, and whispered, &ldquo;Do tell
      me, Ethel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I shan&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you say fairly if you don&rsquo;t know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was obliged to confess his ignorance, and Richard made him conjugate
      the whole verb opponor from beginning to end, in which he wanted a good
      deal of help.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel could not help saying, &ldquo;How did you find out the meaning of that
      word, Tom, if you didn&rsquo;t look out the verb?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; drawled Tom, in the voice, half sullen, half
      piteous, which he always assumed when out of sorts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very odd,&rdquo; she said decidedly; but Richard took no notice, and
      proceeded to the other lessons, which went off tolerably well, except the
      arithmetic, where there was some great misunderstanding, into which Ethel
      did not enter for some time. When she did attend, she perceived that Tom
      had brought a right answer, without understanding the working of the sum,
      and that Richard was putting him through it. She began to be worked into a
      state of dismay and indignation at Tom&rsquo;s behaviour, and Richard&rsquo;s calm
      indifference, which made her almost forget &lsquo;Jane Sparks&rsquo;, and long to be
      alone with Richard; but all the world kept coming into the room, and going
      out, and she could not say what was in her mind till after dinner, when,
      seeing Richard go up into Margaret&rsquo;s room, she ran after him, and entering
      it, surprised Margaret, by not beginning on her books, but saying at once,
      &ldquo;Ritchie, I wanted to speak to you about Tom. I am sure he shuffled about
      those lessons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid he does,&rdquo; said Richard, much concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, do you mean that it is often so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much too often,&rdquo; said Richard; &ldquo;but I have never been able to detect him;
      he is very sharp, and has some underhand way of preparing his lessons that
      I cannot make out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you know it, Margaret?&rdquo; said Ethel, astonished not to see her sister
      looked shocked as well as sorry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;Ritchie and I have often talked it over, and tried
      to think what was to be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me! why don&rsquo;t you tell papa? It is such a terrible thing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it is,&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;but we have nothing positive or tangible to
      accuse Tom of; we don&rsquo;t know what he does, and have never caught him out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure he must have found out the meaning of that oppositum in some
      wrong way&mdash;if he had looked it out, he would only have found
      opposite. Nothing but opponor could have shown him the rendering which he
      made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s like what I have said almost every day,&rdquo; said Richard, &ldquo;but there
      we are&mdash;I can&rsquo;t get any further.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he guesses by the context,&rdquo; said Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be impossible to do so always,&rdquo; said both the Latin scholars at
      once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t think how you can take it so quietly,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;I would
      have told papa the first moment, and put a stop to it. I have a great mind
      to do so, if you won&rsquo;t.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ethel, Ethel, that would never do!&rdquo; exclaimed Margaret, &ldquo;pray don&rsquo;t. Papa
      would be so dreadfully grieved and angry with poor Tom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, so he deserves,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what it is to see papa angry,&rdquo; said Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me, Richard!&rdquo; cried Ethel, who thought she knew pretty well what his
      sharp words were. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure papa never was angry with me, without making
      me love him more, and, at least, want to be better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a girl,&rdquo; said Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are higher spirited, and shake off things faster,&rdquo; said Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what do you think he would do to Tom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he would be so very angry, that Tom, who, you know, is timid and
      meek, would be dreadfully frightened,&rdquo; said Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what he ought to be, frightened out of these tricks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid it would frighten him into them still more,&rdquo; said Richard,
      &ldquo;and perhaps give him such a dread of my father as would prevent him from
      ever being open with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides, it would make papa so very unhappy,&rdquo; added Margaret. &ldquo;Of course,
      if poor dear Tom had been found out in any positive deceit, we ought to
      mention it at once, and let him be punished; but while it is all vague
      suspicion, and of what papa has such a horror of, it would only grieve
      him, and make him constantly anxious, without, perhaps, doing Tom any
      good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think all that is expediency,&rdquo; said Ethel, in her bluff, abrupt way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; said Richard, &ldquo;we have nothing positive to accuse him of, and
      if we had, it would be of no use. He will be at school in three weeks, and
      there he would be sure to shirk, even if he left it off here. Every one
      does, and thinks nothing of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard!&rdquo; cried both sisters, shocked. &ldquo;You never did?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, we didn&rsquo;t, but most others do, and not bad fellows either. It is not
      the way of boys to think much of those things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is mean&mdash;it is dishonourable&mdash;it is deceitful!&rdquo; cried Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it is very wrong, but you&rsquo;ll never get the general run of boys to
      think so,&rdquo; said Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then Tom ought not to go to school at all till he is well armed against
      it,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That can&rsquo;t be helped,&rdquo; said Richard. &ldquo;He will get clear of it in time,
      when he knows better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will talk to him,&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;and, indeed, I think it would be
      better than worrying papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;of course I shan&rsquo;t tell, because it is not my
      business, but I think papa ought to know everything about us, and I don&rsquo;t
      like your keeping anything back. It is being almost as bad as Tom
      himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With which words, as Flora entered, Ethel marched out of the room in
      displeasure, and went down, resolved to settle Jane Sparks by herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ethel is out of sorts to-day,&rdquo; said Flora. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have had a discussion,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;She has been terribly shocked
      by finding out what we have often thought about poor little Tom, and she
      thinks we ought to tell papa. Her principle is quite right, but I doubt&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know exactly how Ethel would do it!&rdquo; cried Flora; &ldquo;blurt out all on a
      sudden, &lsquo;Papa, Tom cheats at his lessons!&rsquo; then there would be a
      tremendous uproar, papa would scold Tom till he almost frightened him out
      of his wits, and then find out it was only suspicion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And never have any comfort again,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;He would always dread
      that Tom was deceiving him, and then think it was all for want of&mdash;Oh,
      no, it will never do to speak of it, unless we find out some positive
      piece of misbehaviour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it would do Tom no good to make him afraid of papa,&rdquo; said Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ethel&rsquo;s rule is right in principle,&rdquo; said Margaret thoughtfully, &ldquo;that
      papa ought to know all without reserve, and yet it will hardly do in
      practice. One must use discretion, and not tease him about every little
      thing. He takes them so much to heart, that he would be almost distracted;
      and, with so much business abroad, I think at home he should have nothing
      but rest, and, as far as we can, freedom from care and worry. Anything
      wrong about the children brings on the grief so much, that I cannot bear
      to mention it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard and Flora agreed with her, admiring the spirit which made her, in
      her weakness and helplessness, bear the whole burden of family cares
      alone, and devote herself entirely to spare her father. He was, indeed,
      her first object, and she would have sacrificed anything to give him ease
      of mind; but, perhaps, she regarded him more as a charge of her own, than
      as, in very truth, the head of the family. She had the government in her
      hands, and had never been used to see him exercise it much in detail (she
      did not know how much her mother had referred to him in private), and had
      succeeded to her authority at a time when his health and spirits were in
      such a state as to make it doubly needful to spare him. It was no wonder
      that she sometimes carried her consideration beyond what was strictly
      right, and forgot that he was the real authority, more especially as his
      impulsive nature sometimes carried him away, and his sound judgment was
      not certain to come into play at the first moment, so that it required
      some moral courage to excite displeasure, so easy of manifestation; and of
      such courage there was, perhaps, a deficiency in her character. Nor had
      she yet detected her own satisfaction in being the first with every one in
      the family.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel was put out, as Flora had discovered, and when she was downstairs
      she found it out, and accused herself of having been cross to Margaret,
      and unkind to Tom&mdash;of wishing to be a tell-tale. But still, though
      displeased with herself, she was dissatisfied with Margaret; it might be
      right, but it did not agree with her notions. She wanted to see every one
      uncompromising, as girls of fifteen generally do; she had an intense
      disgust and loathing of underhand ways, could not bear to think of Tom&rsquo;s
      carrying them on, and going to a place of temptation with them
      uncorrected; and she looked up to her father with the reverence and
      enthusiasm of one like minded.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was vexed on another score. Norman came home from Abbotstoke Grange
      without having seen Miss Rivers, but with a fresh basket of choice
      flowers, rapturous descriptions of Mr. Rivers&rsquo;s prints, and a present of
      an engraving, in shading, such as to give the effect of a cast, of a very
      fine head of Alexander. Nothing was to be thought of but a frame for this&mdash;olive,
      bay, laurel, everything appropriate to the conqueror. Margaret and Norman
      were engrossed in the subject, and, to Ethel, who had no toleration for
      fancy work, who expected everything to be either useful or intellectual,
      this seemed very frivolous. She heard her father say how glad he was to
      see Norman interested and occupied, and certainly, though it was only in
      leather leaves, it was better than drooping and attending to nothing. She
      knew, too, that Margaret did it for his sake, but, said Ethel to herself,
      &ldquo;It was very odd that people should find amusement in such things.
      Margaret always had a turn for them, but it was very strange in Norman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then came the pang of finding out that this was aggravated by the neglect
      of herself; she called it all selfishness, and felt that she had had an
      uncomfortable, unsatisfactory day, with everything going wrong.

      CHAPTER XVII.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Gently supported by the ready aid
       Of loving hands, whose little work of toil
     Her grateful prodigality repaid
       With all the benediction of her smile,
         She turned her failing feet
         To the softly cushioned seat,
       Dispensing kindly greetings all the time.
                                             R. M. MILNES.
</pre>
    <p>
      Three great events signalised the month of January. The first was, the
      opening of the school at Cocksmoor, whither a cart transported half a
      dozen forms, various books, and three dozen plum-buns, Margaret&rsquo;s
      contribution, in order that the school might begin with eclat. There
      walked Mr. Wilmot, Richard, and Flora, with Mary, in a jumping, capering
      state of delight, and Ethel, not knowing whether she rejoiced. She kept
      apart from the rest, and hardly spoke, for this long probation had
      impressed her with a sense of responsibility, and she knew that it was a
      great work to which she had set her hand&mdash;a work in which she must
      persevere, and in which she could not succeed in her own strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took hold of Flora&rsquo;s hand, and squeezed it hard, in a fit of shyness,
      when they came upon the hamlet, and saw the children watching for them;
      and when they reached the house, she would fain have shrank into nothing;
      there was a swelling of heart that seemed to overwhelm and stifle her, and
      the effect of which was to keep her standing unhelpful, when the others
      were busy bringing in the benches and settling the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a tidy room, but it seemed very small when they ranged the benches,
      and opened the door to the seven-and-twenty children, and the four or five
      women who stood waiting. Ethel felt some dismay when they all came pushing
      in, without order or civility, and would have been utterly at a loss what
      to do with her scholars now she had got them, if Richard and Flora had not
      marshalled them to the benches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rough heads, torn garments, staring vacant eyes, and mouths gaping in shy
      rudeness&mdash;it was a sight to disenchant her of visions of pleasure in
      the work she had set herself. It was well that she had not to take the
      initiative.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wilmot said a few simple words to the mothers about the wish to teach
      their children what was right, and to do the best at present practicable;
      and then told the children that he hoped they would take pains to be good,
      and mind what they were taught. Then he desired all to kneel down; he said
      the Collect, &ldquo;Prevent us, O Lord, in all our doings,&rdquo; and then the Lord&rsquo;s
      Prayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel felt as if she could bear it better, and was more up to the work
      after this. Next, the children were desired to stand round the room, and
      Mr. Wilmot tried who could say the Catechism&mdash;the two biggest, a boy
      and a girl, had not an idea of it, and the boy looked foolish, and grinned
      at being asked what was his name. One child was tolerably perfect, and
      about half a dozen had some dim notions. Three were entirely ignorant of
      the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, and many of the others did not by any means pronounce
      the words of it. Jane and Fanny Taylor, Rebekah Watts, and Mrs. Green&rsquo;s
      little boy, were the only ones who, by their own account, used morning and
      evening prayers, though, on further examination, it appeared that Polly
      and Jenny Hall, and some others, were accustomed to repeat the old rhyme
      about &ldquo;Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,&rdquo; and Una M&rsquo;Carthy and her little
      brother Fergus said something that nobody could make out, but which Mr.
      Wilmot thought had once been an &ldquo;Ave Maria.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some few of the children could read, and several more knew their letters.
      The least ignorant were selected to form a first class, and Mr. Wilmot
      promised a Prayer-book to the first who should be able to repeat the
      Catechism without a mistake, and a Bible to the first who could read a
      chapter in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then followed a setting of tasks, varying from a verse of a Psalm, or the
      first answer in the Catechism, down to the distinction between A, B, and
      C; all to be ready by next Tuesday, when, weather permitting, a second
      lesson was to be given. Afterwards, a piece of advice of Margaret&rsquo;s was
      followed, and Flora read aloud to the assembly the story of &ldquo;Margaret
      Fletcher.&rdquo; To some this seemed to give great satisfaction, especially to
      Una, but Ethel was surprised to see that many, and those not only little
      ones, talked and yawned. They had no power of attention even to a story,
      and the stillness was irksome to such wild colts. It was plain that it was
      time to leave off, and there was no capacity there which did not find the
      conclusion agreeable, when the basket was opened, and Ethel and Mary
      distributed the buns, with instructions to say, &ldquo;thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next Tuesday, some of the lessons were learned, Una&rsquo;s perfectly, the
      big ignorant boy came no more; and some of the children had learned to
      behave better, while others behaved worse; Ethel began to know what she
      was about; Richard&rsquo;s gentleness was eminently successful with the little
      girls, impressing good manners on them in a marvellous way; and Mary&rsquo;s
      importance and happiness with alphabet scholars, some bigger than herself,
      were edifying. Cocksmoor was fairly launched.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next memorable day was that of Margaret&rsquo;s being first carried
      downstairs. She had been willing to put it off as long as she could,
      dreading to witness the change below-stairs, and feeling, too, that in
      entering on the family room, without power of leaving it, she was losing
      all quiet and solitude, as well as giving up that monopoly of her father
      in his evenings, which had been her great privilege.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, she tried to talk herself into liking it; and was rewarded by the
      happy commotion it caused, though Dr. May was in a state of excitement and
      nervousness at the prospect of seeing her on the stairs, and his attempts
      to conceal it only made it worse, till Margaret knew she should be nervous
      herself, and wished him out of sight and out of the house till it was
      over, for without him she had full confidence in the coolness and
      steadiness of Richard, and by him it was safely and quietly accomplished.
      She was landed on the sofa, Richard and Flora settling her, and the others
      crowding round and exclaiming, while the newness of the scene and the
      change gave her a sense of confusion, and she shut her eyes to recover her
      thoughts, but opened them the next instant at her father&rsquo;s exclamation
      that she was overcome, smiled to reassure him, and declared herself not
      tired, and to be very glad to be among them again. But the bustle was
      oppressive, and her cheerful manner was an effort; she longed to see them
      all gone, and Flora found it out, sent the children for their walk, and
      carried off Ethel and the brothers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. May was called out of the room at the same time, and she was left
      alone. She gazed round her, at the room where, four months before, she had
      seen her mother with the babe in her arms, the children clustered round
      her, her father exulting in his hen-and-chicken daisies, herself full of
      bright undefined hope, radiant with health and activity, and her one
      trouble such that she now knew the force of her mother&rsquo;s words, that it
      only proved her happiness. It was not till that moment that Margaret
      realised the change; found her eyes filling with tears, as she looked
      round, and saw the familiar furniture and ornaments.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were instantly checked as she heard her father returning, but not so
      that he did not perceive them, and exclaim that it had been too much for
      her. &ldquo;Oh, no&mdash;it was only the first time,&rdquo; said Margaret, losing the
      sense of the painful vacancy in her absorbing desire not to distress her
      father, and thinking only of him as she watched him standing for some
      minutes leaning on the mantel-shelf with his hand shading his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      She began to speak as soon as she thought he was ready to have his mind
      turned away: &ldquo;How nicely Ritchie managed! He carried me so comfortably and
      easily. It is enough to spoil me to be so deftly waited on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad of it,&rdquo; said Dr. May; &ldquo;I am sure the change is better for you;&rdquo;
       but he came and looked at her still with great solicitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ritchie can take excellent care of me,&rdquo; she continued, most anxious to
      divert his thoughts. &ldquo;You see it will do very well indeed for you to take
      Harry to school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to do so. I should like to see his master, and to take
      Norman with me,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;It would be just the thing for him now&mdash;we
      would show him the dockyard, and all those matters, and such a thorough
      holiday would set him up again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is very much better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much better&mdash;he is recovering spirits and tone very fast. That
      leaf-work of yours came at a lucky time. I like to see him looking out for
      a curious fern in the hedgerows&mdash;the pursuit has quite brightened him
      up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he does it so thoroughly,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;Ethel fancies it is rather
      frivolous of him, I believe; but it amuses me to see how men give dignity
      to what women make trifling. He will know everything about the leaves,
      hunts up my botany books, and has taught me a hundred times more of the
      construction and wonders of them than I ever learned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;he has been talking a good deal to me about
      vegetable chemistry. He would make a good scientific botanist, if he were
      to be nothing else. I should be glad if he sticks to it as a pursuit&mdash;&lsquo;tis
      pretty work, and I should like to have gone further with it, if I had ever
      had time for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say he will,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;It will be very pleasant if he can
      go with you. How he would enjoy the British Museum, if there was time for
      him to see it! Have you said anything to him yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I waited to see how you were, as it all depends on that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it depends still more on something else; whether Norman is as fit
      to take care of you as Richard is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s another point. There&rsquo;s nothing but what he could manage now, but I
      don&rsquo;t like saying anything to him. I know he would undertake anything I
      wished, without a word, and then, perhaps, dwell on it in fancy, and force
      himself, till it would turn to a perfect misery, and upset his nerves
      again. I&rsquo;m sorry for it. I meant him to have followed my trade, but he&rsquo;ll
      never do for that. However, he has wits enough to make himself what he
      pleases, and I dare say he will keep at the head of the school after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How very good he has been in refraining from restlessness!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s beautiful!&rdquo; said Dr. May, with strong emotion. &ldquo;Poor boy! I trust
      he&rsquo;ll not be disappointed, and I don&rsquo;t think he will; but I&rsquo;ve promised
      him I won&rsquo;t be annoyed if he should lose his place&mdash;so we must take
      especial care not to show any anxiety. However, for this matter, Margaret,
      I wish you would sound him, and see whether it would be more pleasure or
      pain. Only mind you don&rsquo;t let him think that I shall be vexed, if he feels
      that he can&rsquo;t make up his mind; I would not have him fancy that, for more
      than I can tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This consultation revived the spirits of both; and the others returning,
      found Margaret quite disposed for companionship. If to her the evening was
      sad and strange, like a visit in a dream to some old familiar haunt,
      finding all unnatural, to the rest it was delightful. The room was no
      longer dreary, now that there was a centre for care and attentions, and
      the party was no longer broken up&mdash;the sense of comfort,
      cheerfulness, and home-gathering had returned, and the pleasant evening
      household gossip went round the table almost as it used to do. Dr. May
      resumed his old habit of skimming a club book, and imparting the cream to
      the listeners; and Flora gave them some music, a great treat to Margaret,
      who had long only heard its distant sounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret found an opportunity of talking to Norman, and judged favourably.
      He was much pleased at the prospect of the journey, and of seeing a ship,
      so as to have a clearer notion of the scene where Harry&rsquo;s life was to be
      spent, and though the charge of the arm was a drawback, he did not treat
      it as insurmountable.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days&rsquo; attendance in his father&rsquo;s room gave him confidence in taking
      Richard&rsquo;s place, and, accordingly, the third important measure was decided
      on, namely, that he and his father should accompany Harry to the naval
      school, and be absent three nights. Some relations would be glad to
      receive them in London, and Alan Ernescliffe, who was studying steam
      navigation at Woolwich, volunteered to meet them, and go with them to
      Portsmouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a wonderful event; Norman and Harry had never been beyond Whitford
      in their lives, and none of the young ones could recollect their papa&rsquo;s
      ever going from home for more than one night. Dr. May laughed at Margaret
      for her anxiety and excitement on the subject, and was more amused at
      overhearing Richard&rsquo;s precise directions to Norman over the packing up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, Ritchie,&rdquo; said the doctor, as he saw his portmanteau locked, and the
      key given to Norman, &ldquo;you may well look grave upon it. You won&rsquo;t see it
      look so tidy when it comes back again, and I believe you are thinking it
      will be lucky if you see it at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a very affectionate leave-taking of Harry, who, growing rather
      soft-hearted, thought it needful to be disdainful, scolded Mary and
      Blanche for &ldquo;lugging off his figure-head,&rdquo; and assured them they made as
      much work about it as if he was going to sea at once. Then, to put an end
      to any more embraces, he marched off to the station with Tom, and nearly
      caused the others to be too late, by the search for him that ensued.
    </p>
    <p>
      In due time, Dr. May and Norman returned, looking the better for the
      journey. There was, first, to tell of Harry&rsquo;s school and its master, and
      Alan Ernescliffe&rsquo;s introduction of him to a nice-looking boy of his own
      age; then they were eloquent on the wonders of the dockyard, the Victory,
      the block machinery. And London&mdash;while Dr. May went to transact some
      business, Norman had been with Alan at the British Museum, and though he
      had intended to see half London besides, there was no tearing him away
      from the Elgin marbles; and nothing would serve him, but bringing Dr. May
      the next morning to visit the Ninevite bulls. Norman further said, that
      whereas papa could never go out of his house without meeting people who
      had something to say to him, it was the same elsewhere. Six acquaintances
      he had met unexpectedly in London, and two at Portsmouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the conversation went on all the evening, to the great delight of all.
      It was more about things than people, though Flora inquired after Mr.
      Ernescliffe, and was told he had met them at the station, had been
      everywhere with them, and had dined at the Mackenzies&rsquo; each day. &ldquo;How was
      he looking?&rdquo; Ethel asked; and was told pretty much the same as when he
      went away; and, on a further query from Flora, it appeared that an old
      naval friend of his father&rsquo;s had hopes of a ship, and had promised to have
      him with him, and thereupon warm hopes were expressed that Harry might
      have a berth in the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when is he coming here again, papa?&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! oh! I can&rsquo;t tell. I say, isn&rsquo;t it high time to ring?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When they went up at night, every one felt that half the say had not been
      said, and there were fresh beginnings on the stairs. Norman triumphantly
      gave the key to Richard, and then called to Ethel, &ldquo;I say, won&rsquo;t you come
      into my room while I unpack?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I should like it very much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel sat on the bed, rolled up in a cloak, while Norman undid his bag,
      announcing at the same time, &ldquo;Well, Ethel, papa says I may get to my
      Euripides to-morrow, if I please, and only work an hour at a time!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am so glad. Then he thinks you quite well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am quite well. I hope I&rsquo;ve done with nonsense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how did you get on with his arm?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well&mdash;he was so patient, and told me how to manage. You heard
      that Sir Matthew said it had got much better in these few weeks. Oh, here
      it is! There&rsquo;s a present for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, thank you. From you, or from papa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is mine. Papa has a present for every one in his bag. He said, at
      last, that a man with eleven children hadn&rsquo;t need to go to London very
      often.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you got this beautiful &lsquo;Lyra Innocentium&rsquo; for me? How very kind of
      you, Norman. It is just what I wished for. Such lovely binding&mdash;and
      those embossed edges to the leaves. Oh! they make a pattern as they open!
      I never saw anything like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw such a one on Miss Rivers&rsquo;s table, and asked Ernescliffe where to
      get one like it. See, here&rsquo;s what my father gave me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Bishop Ken&rsquo;s Manual&rsquo;. That is in readiness for the Confirmation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look. I begged him to put my name, though he said it was a pity to do it
      with his left hand; I didn&rsquo;t like to wait, so I asked him at least to
      write N. W. May, and the date.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he has added Prov. xxiii. 24, 25. Let me look it out.&rdquo; She did so,
      and instead of reading it aloud, looked at Norman full of congratulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How it ought to make one&mdash;&rdquo; and there Norman broke off from the
      fullness of his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad he put both verses&rdquo; said Ethel presently. &ldquo;How pleased with you
      he must be!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A silence while brother and sister both gazed intently at the crooked
      characters, till at last Ethel, with a long breath, resumed her ordinary
      tone, and said, &ldquo;How well he has come to write with his left hand now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Did you know that he wrote himself to tell Ernescliffe Sir Matthew&rsquo;s
      opinion of Margaret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No: did he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, Ethel,&rdquo; said Norman, as he knelt on the floor, and tumbled
      miscellaneous articles out of his bag, &ldquo;it is my belief that Ernescliffe
      is in love with her, and that papa thinks so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; cried Ethel, starting up. &ldquo;That is famous. We should always
      have Margaret at home when he goes to sea!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But mind, Ethel, for your life you must not say one word to any living
      creature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, I promise you I won&rsquo;t, Norman, if you&rsquo;ll only tell me how you
      found it out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What first put it in my head was the first evening, while I was undoing
      the portmanteau; my father leaned on the mantel-shelf, and sighed and
      muttered, &lsquo;Poor Ernescliffe! I wish it may end well.&rsquo; I thought he forgot
      that I was there, so I would not seem to notice, but I soon saw it was
      that he meant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo; cried Ethel eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;by Alan&rsquo;s way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me&mdash;I want to know what people do when they are in love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing particular,&rdquo; said Norman, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you hear him inquire for her? How did he look?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell. That was when he met us at the station before I thought of
      it, and I had to see to the luggage. But I&rsquo;ll tell you one thing, Ethel;
      when papa was talking of her to Mrs. Mackenzie, at the other end of the
      room, all his attention went away in an instant from what he was saying.
      And once, when Harry said something to me about her, he started, and
      looked round so earnestly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes&mdash;that&rsquo;s like people in books. And did he colour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I don&rsquo;t recollect that he did,&rdquo; said Norman; &ldquo;but I observed he never
      asked directly after her if he could help it, but always was trying to
      lead, in some round-about way, to hearing what she was doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he call her Margaret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I watched; but to me he always said, &lsquo;Your sister,&rsquo; and if he had to
      speak of her to papa, he said, &lsquo;Miss May.&rsquo; And then you should have seen
      his attention to papa. I could hardly get a chance of doing anything for
      papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sure of it!&rdquo; cried Ethel, clasping her hands. &ldquo;But, poor man, how
      unhappy he must have been at having to go away when she was so ill!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, the last time he saw her was when he carried her upstairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear! I hope he will soon come here again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose he will. Papa did not ask him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me, Norman! Why not? Isn&rsquo;t papa very fond of him? Why shouldn&rsquo;t he
      come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see, Ethel, that would be of no use while poor Margaret is no
      better. If he gained her affections, it would only make her unhappy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but she is much better. She can raise herself up now without help,
      and sat up ever so long this morning, without leaning back on her
      cushions. She is getting well&mdash;you know Sir Matthew said she would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but I suppose papa thinks they had better say nothing till she is
      quite well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when she is! How famous it will be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s another thing; he is very poor, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure papa doesn&rsquo;t care about people being rich.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose Alan thinks he ought not to marry, unless he could make his
      wife comfortable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here&mdash;it would be all very easy: she should stay with us, and
      be comfortable here, and he go to sea, and get lots of prize money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s what you call domestic felicity!&rdquo; said Norman, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He might have her when he was at home,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; that would never do,&rdquo; said Norman. &ldquo;Do you think Ernescliffe&rsquo;s a
      man that would marry a wife for her father to maintain her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, papa would like it very much. He is not a mercenary father in a
      book.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey! what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; said a voice Ethel little expected. &ldquo;Contraband talk
      at contraband times? What&rsquo;s this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you hear, papa?&rdquo; said Ethel, looking down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only your last words, as I came up to ask Norman what he had done with my
      pocket-book. Mind, I ask no impertinent questions; but, if you have no
      objection, I should like to know what gained me the honour of that
      compliment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Norman?&rdquo; said Ethel interrogatively, and blushing in emulation of her
      brother, who was crimson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find it,&rdquo; said he, rushing off with a sort of nod and sign, that
      conveyed to Ethel that there was no help for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, with much confusion, she whispered into her papa&rsquo;s ear that Norman had
      been telling her something he guessed about Mr. Ernescliffe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father at first smiled, a pleased amused smile. &ldquo;Ah! ha! so Master
      June has his eyes and ears open, has he? A fine bit of gossip to regale
      you with on his return!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He told me to say not one word,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right&mdash;mind you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Dr. May, and Ethel was surprised to see
      how sorrowful his face became. At the same moment Norman returned, still
      very red, and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve put out the pocket-book, papa. I think I should
      tell you I repeated what, perhaps, you did not mean me to hear&mdash;you
      talked to yourself something of pitying Ernescliffe.&rdquo; The doctor smiled
      again at the boy&rsquo;s high-minded openness, which must have cost an effort of
      self-humiliation. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say little pitchers have long ears, to a
      May-pole like you, Norman,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I think I ought rather to apologise
      for having inadvertently tumbled in among your secrets; I assure you I did
      not come to spy you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, no, no, no!&rdquo; repeated Ethel vehemently. &ldquo;Then you didn&rsquo;t mind our
      talking about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not, as long as it goes no further. It is the use of sisters to
      tell them one&rsquo;s private sentiments. Is not it, Norman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you really think it is so, papa?&rdquo; Ethel could not help whispering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it is&rdquo;, said Dr. May, sighing; then, as he caught her earnest
      eyes, &ldquo;The more I see of Alan, the finer fellow I think him, and the more
      sorry I am for him. It seems presumptuous, almost wrong, to think of the
      matter at all while my poor Margaret is in this state; and, if she were
      well, there are other difficulties which would, perhaps, prevent his
      speaking, or lead to long years of waiting and wearing out hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Money?&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay! Though I so far deserve your compliment, miss, that should be foolish
      enough, if she were but well, to give my consent to-morrow, because I
      could not help it; yet one can&rsquo;t live forty-six years in this world
      without seeing it is wrong to marry without a reasonable dependence&mdash;and
      there won&rsquo;t be much among eleven of you. It makes my heart ache to think
      of it, come what may, as far as I can see, and without her to judge. The
      only comfort is, that poor Margaret herself knows nothing of it, and is at
      peace so far. It will be ordered for them, anyhow. Good-night, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel sought her room, with graver, deeper thoughts of life than she had
      carried upstairs.

      CHAPTER XVIII.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Saw ye never in the meadows,
       Where your little feet did pass,
     Down below, the sweet white daisies
       Growing in the long green grass?

     Saw you never lilac blossoms,
       Or acacia white and red,
     Waving brightly in the sunshine,
       On the tall trees over head?
                           HYMNS FOR CHILDREN, C. F. A.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear child, what a storm you have had! how wet you must be!&rdquo; exclaimed
      Mrs. Larpent, as Meta Rivers came bounding up the broad staircase at
      Abbotstoke Grange.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no; I am quite dry; feel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; said Mrs. Larpent, drawing her darling into a luxurious
      bedroom, lighted up by a glowing fire, and full of pretty things. &ldquo;Here,
      come and take off your wet things, my dear, and Bellairs shall bring you
      some tea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m dry. I&rsquo;m warm,&rdquo; said Meta, tossing off her plumy hat, as she
      established herself, with her feet on the fender. &ldquo;But where do you think
      I have been? You have so much to hear. But first&mdash;three guesses where
      we were in the rain!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the Stoneborough Cloisters, that you wanted to see? My dear, you did
      not keep your papa in the cold there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; we never got there at all; guess again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Mr. Edward Wilmot&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could it have been at Dr. May&rsquo;s? Really, then, you must tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There! you deserve a good long story; beginning at the beginning,&rdquo; said
      Meta, clapping her hands, &ldquo;wasn&rsquo;t it curious? as we were coming up the
      last hill, we met some girls in deep mourning, with a lady who looked like
      their governess. I wondered whether they could be Dr. May&rsquo;s daughters, and
      so it turned out they were.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Presently there began to fall little square lumps, neither hail, nor
      snow, nor rain; it grew very cold, and rain came on. It would have been
      great fun, if I had not been afraid papa would catch cold, and he said we
      would canter on to the inn. But, luckily, there was Dr. May walking up the
      street, and he begged us to come into his house. I was so glad! We were
      tolerably wet, and Dr. May said something about hoping the girls were at
      home; well, when he opened the drawing-room door, there was the poor
      daughter lying on the sofa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor girl! tell me of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you must go and see her; you won&rsquo;t look at her without losing your
      heart. Papa liked her so much&mdash;see if he does not talk of her all the
      evening. She looks the picture of goodness and sweetness. Only think of
      her having some of the maidenhair and cape jessamine still in water, that
      we sent her so long ago. She shall have some flowers every three days.
      Well, Dr. May said, &lsquo;There is one at least, that is sure to be at home.&rsquo;
      She felt my habit, and said I must go and change it, and she called to a
      little thing of six, telling her to show me the way to Flora. She smiled,
      and said she wished she could go herself, but Flora would take care of me.
      Little Blanche came and took hold of my hand, chattering away, up we went,
      up two staircases, and at the top of the last stood a girl about
      seventeen, so pretty! such deep blue eyes, and such a complexion! &lsquo;That&rsquo;s
      Flora,&rsquo; little Blanche said; &lsquo;Flora, this is Miss Rivers, and she&rsquo;s wet,
      and Margaret says you are to take care of her.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that was your introduction?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; we got acquainted in a minute. She took me into her room&mdash;such
      a room! I believe Bellairs would be angry if she had such a one; all up in
      the roof, no fire, no carpet, except little strips by the beds; there were
      three beds. Flora used to sleep there till Miss May was ill, and now she
      dresses there. Yet I am sure they are as much ladies as I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are an only daughter, my dear, and a petted one,&rdquo; said Mrs. Larpent,
      smiling. &ldquo;There are too many of them to make much of, as we do of our
      Meta.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so; but I did not know gentlewomen lived in such a way,&rdquo; said
      Meta. &ldquo;There were nice things about, a beautiful inlaid work-box of
      Flora&rsquo;s, and a rosewood desk, and plenty of books, and a Greek book and
      dictionary were spread open. I asked Flora if they were hers, and she
      laughed and said no; and that Ethel would be much discomposed that I had
      see them. Ethel keeps up with her brother Norman&mdash;only fancy! and he
      at the head of the school. How clever she must be!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear, were you standing in your wet things all this time!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I was trying on their frocks, but they trailed on the ground upon me,
      so she asked if I would come and sit by the nursery fire till my habit was
      dry; and there was a dear little good-humoured baby, so fair and pretty.
      She is not a bit shy, will go to anybody, but, they say, she likes no one
      so well as her brother Norman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you had a regular treat of baby-nursing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I had; I could not part with her, the darling. Flora thought we
      might take her down, and I liked playing with her in the drawing-room and
      talking to Miss May, till the fly came to take us home. I wanted to have
      seen Ethel; but, only think, papa has asked Dr. May to bring Flora some
      day; how I hope he will!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Little Meta having told her story, and received plenty of sympathy,
      proceeded to dress, and, while her maid braided her hair, a musing fit
      fell upon her. &ldquo;I have seen something of life to-day,&rdquo; thought she. &ldquo;I had
      thought of the great difference between us and the poor, but I did not
      know ladies lived in such different ways. I should be very miserable
      without Bellairs, or without a fire in my room. I don&rsquo;t know what I should
      do if I had to live in that cold, shabby den, and do my own hair, yet they
      think nothing of it, and they are cultivated and ladylike! Is it all
      fancy, and being brought up to it? I wonder if it is right? Yet dear papa
      likes me to have these things, and can afford them. I never knew I was
      luxurious before, and yet I think I must be! One thing I do wish, and that
      is, that I was of as much use as those girls. I ought to be. I am a
      motherless girl like them, and I ought to be everything to papa, just as
      Miss May is, even lying on the sofa there, and only two years older than I
      am. I don&rsquo;t think I am of any use at all; he is fond of me, of course,
      dear papa; and if I died, I don&rsquo;t know what would become of him; but
      that&rsquo;s only because I am his daughter&mdash;he has only George besides to
      care for. But, really and truly, he would get on as well without me. I
      never do anything for him, but now and then playing to him in the evening,
      and that not always, I am afraid, when I want to be about anything else.
      He is always petting me, and giving me all I want, but I never do anything
      but my lessons, and going to the school, and the poor people, and that is
      all pleasure. I have so much that I never miss what I give away. I wonder
      whether it is all right! Leonora and Agatha have not so much money to do
      as they please with&mdash;they are not so idolised. George said, when he
      was angry, that papa idolises me; but they have all these comforts and
      luxuries, and never think of anything but doing what they like. They never
      made me consider as these Mays do. I should like to know them more. I do
      so much want a friend of my own age. It is the only want I have. I have
      tried to make a friend of Leonora, but I cannot; she never cares for what
      I do. If she saw these Mays she would look down on them. Dear Mrs. Larpent
      is better than any one, but then she is so much older. Flora May shall be
      my friend. I&rsquo;ll make her call me Meta as soon as she comes. When will it
      be? The day after tomorrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But little Meta watched in vain. Dr. May always came with either Richard
      or the groom, to drive him, and if Meta met him and hoped he would bring
      Flora next time, he only answered that Flora would like it very much, and
      he hoped soon to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth was, it was no such everyday matter as Meta imagined. The larger
      carriage had been broken, and the only vehicle held only the doctor&mdash;his
      charioteer&mdash;and in a very minute appendage behind, a small son of the
      gardener, to open gates, and hold the horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proposal had been one of those general invitations to be fulfilled at
      any time, and therefore easily set aside; and Dr. May, though continually
      thinking he should like to take his girls to Abbotstoke, never saw the
      definite time for so doing; and Flora herself, though charmed with Miss
      Rivers, and delighted with the prospect of visiting her, only viewed it as
      a distant prospect.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was plenty of immediate interest to occupy them at home, to say
      nothing of the increasing employment that Cocksmoor gave to thoughts,
      legs, and needles. There was the commencement of the half-year, when Tom&rsquo;s
      schoolboy life was to begin, and when it would be proved whether Norman
      were able to retain his elevation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret had much anxiety respecting the little boy about to be sent into
      a scene of temptation. Her great confidence was in Richard, who told her
      that boys did many more wrong things than were known at home, and yet
      turned out very well, and that Tom would be sure to right himself in the
      end. Richard had been blameless in his whole school course, but though
      never partaking of the other boys&rsquo; evil practices, he could not form an
      independent estimate of character, and his tone had been a little hurt, by
      sharing the school public opinion of morality. He thought Stoneborough and
      its temptations inevitable, and only wished to make the best of it.
      Margaret was afraid to harass her father by laying the case before him.
      All her brothers had gone safely through the school, and it never occurred
      to her that it was possible that, if her father knew the bias of Tom&rsquo;s
      disposition, he might choose, for the present, at least, some other mode
      of education.
    </p>
    <p>
      She talked earnestly to Tom, and he listened impatiently. There is an age
      when boys rebel against female rule, and are not yet softened by the
      chivalry of manhood, and Tom was at this time of life. He did not like to
      be lectured by a sister, secretly disputed her right, and, proud of
      becoming a schoolboy, had not the generous deference for her weakness felt
      by his elder brothers; he was all the time peeling a stick, as if to show
      that he was not attending, and he raised up his shoulder pettishly
      whenever she came to a mention of the religious duty of sincerity. She did
      not long continue her advice, and, much disappointed and concerned, tried
      to console herself with hoping that he might have heeded more than he
      seemed to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was placed tolerably high in the school, and Norman, who had the first
      choice of fags, took him instead of Hector Ernescliffe, who had just
      passed beyond the part of the school liable to be fagged. He said he liked
      school, looked bright when he came home in the evenings, and the sisters
      hoped all was right.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every one was just now anxiously watching Norman, especially his father,
      who strove in vain to keep back all manifestation of his earnest desire to
      see him retain his post. Resolutely did the doctor refrain from asking any
      questions, when the boys came in, but he could not keep his eyes from
      studying the face, to see whether it bore marks of mental fatigue, and
      from following him about the room, to discover whether he found it
      necessary, as he had done last autumn, to spend the evening in study. It
      was no small pleasure to see him come in with his hand full of
      horse-chestnut and hazel-buds, and proceed to fetch the microscope and
      botany books, throwing himself eagerly into the study of the wonders of
      their infant forms, searching deeply into them with Margaret, and talking
      them over with his father, who was very glad to promote the pursuit&mdash;one
      in which he had always taken great interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another night Dr. May was for a moment disturbed by seeing the
      school-books put out, but Norman had only some notes to compare, and while
      he did so, he was remarking on Flora&rsquo;s music, and joining in the
      conversation so freely as to prove it was no labour to him. In truth, he
      was evidently quite recovered, entirely himself again, except that he was
      less boyish. He had been very lively and full of merry nonsense; but his
      ardour for play had gone off with his high spirits, and there was a
      manliness of manner, and tone of mind, that made him appear above his real
      age.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of a fortnight he volunteered to tell his father that all was
      right. &ldquo;I am not afraid of not keeping my place,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you were quite
      right, papa. I am more up to my work than I was ever before, and it comes
      to me quite fresh and pleasant. I don&rsquo;t promise to get the Randall
      scholarship, if Forder and Cheviot stay on, but I can quite keep up to the
      mark in school work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said Dr. May, much rejoiced. &ldquo;Are you sure you do it with
      ease, and without its haunting you at night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; quite sure. I can&rsquo;t think what has made Dr. Hoxton set us on in
      such easy things this time. It is very lucky for me, for one gets so much
      less time to oneself as dux.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! with keeping order?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said Norman. &ldquo;I fancy they think they may take liberties because I
      am new and young. I must have my eye in all corners of the hall at once,
      and do my own work by snatches, as I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you make them attend to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, pretty well, when it comes to the point&mdash;&lsquo;will you, or
      will you not?&rsquo; Cheviot is a great help, too, and has all the weight of
      being the eldest fellow amongst us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But still you find it harder work than learning? You had rather have to
      master the dead language than the live tongues?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A pretty deal,&rdquo; said Norman; then added, &ldquo;One knows what to be at with
      the dead, better than with the living; they don&rsquo;t make parties against
      one. I don&rsquo;t wonder at it. It was very hard on some of those great fellows
      to have me set before them, but I do not think it is fair to visit it by
      putting up the little boys to all sorts of mischief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shameful!&rdquo; said the doctor warmly; &ldquo;but never mind, Norman, keep your
      temper, and do your own duty, and you are man enough to put down such
      petty spite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope I shall manage rightly,&rdquo; said Norman; &ldquo;but I shall be glad if I
      can get the Randall and get away to Oxford; school is not what it used to
      be, and if you don&rsquo;t think me too young&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t; certainly not. Trouble has made a man of you, Norman, and
      you are fitter to be with men than boys. In the meantime, if you can be
      patient with these fellows, you&rsquo;ll be of great use where you are. If there
      had been any one like you at the head of the school in my time, it would
      have kept me out of no end of scrapes. How does Tom get on? he is not
      likely to fall into this set, I trust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not sure,&rdquo; said Norman; &ldquo;he does pretty well on the whole. Some of
      them began by bullying him, and that made him cling to Cheviot and
      Ernescliffe, and the better party; but lately I have thought Anderson,
      junior, rather making up to him, and I don&rsquo;t know whether they don&rsquo;t think
      that tempting him over to them would be the surest way of vexing me. I
      have an eye over him, and I hope he may get settled into the steadier sort
      before next half.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a silence, Norman said, &ldquo;Papa, there is a thing I can&rsquo;t settle in my
      own mind. Suppose there had been wrong things done when older boys, and
      excellent ones too, were at the head of the school, yet they never
      interfered, do you think I ought to let it go on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not, or why is power given to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I thought,&rdquo; said Norman; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see it otherwise. I wish I could,
      for it will be horrid to set about it, and they&rsquo;ll think it a regular
      shame in me to meddle. Oh! I know what I came into the study for; I want
      you to be so kind as to lend me your pocket Greek Testament. I gave Harry
      my little one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very welcome. What do you want it for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norman coloured. &ldquo;I met with a sermon the other day that recommended
      reading a bit of it every day, and I thought I should like to try, now the
      Confirmation is coming. One can always have some quiet by getting away
      into the cloister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless you, my boy! while you go on in this way, I have not much fear but
      that you&rsquo;ll know how to manage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norman&rsquo;s rapid progress affected another of the household in an unexpected
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Margaret, my dear, I wish to speak to you,&rdquo; said Miss Winter, reappearing
      when Margaret thought every one was gone out walking. She would have said,
      &ldquo;I am very sorry for it&rdquo;&mdash;so ominous was the commencement&mdash;and
      her expectations were fulfilled when Miss Winter had solemnly seated
      herself, and taken out her netting. &ldquo;I wished to speak to you about dear
      Ethel,&rdquo; said the governess; &ldquo;you know how unwilling I always am to make
      any complaint, but I cannot be satisfied with her present way of going
      on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;I am much grieved to hear this. I thought she
      had been taking great pains to improve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So she was at one time. I would not by any means wish to deny it, and it
      is not of her learning that I speak, but of a hurried, careless way of
      doing everything, and an irritability at being interfered with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret knew how Miss Winter often tried Ethel&rsquo;s temper, and was inclined
      to take her sister&rsquo;s part. &ldquo;Ethel&rsquo;s time is so fully occupied,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the very thing that I was going to observe, my dear. Her time is
      too much occupied, and my conviction is, that it is hurtful to a girl of
      her age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was a new idea to Margaret, who was silent, longing to prove Miss
      Winter wrong, and not have to see poor Ethel pained by having to
      relinquish any of her cherished pursuits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see there is that Cocksmoor,&rdquo; said Miss Winter. &ldquo;You do not know how
      far off it is, my dear; much too great a distance for a young girl to be
      walking continually in all weathers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a question for papa,&rdquo; thought Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; continued Miss Winter, &ldquo;those children engross almost all her
      time and thoughts. She is working for them, preparing lessons, running
      after them continually. It takes off her whole mind from her proper
      occupations, unsettles her, and I do think it is beyond what befits a
      young lady of her age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In addition,&rdquo; said Miss Winter, &ldquo;she is at every spare moment busy with
      Latin and Greek, and I cannot think that to keep pace with a boy of
      Norman&rsquo;s age and ability can be desirable for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a great deal,&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am convinced that she does more than is right,&rdquo; continued Miss Winter.
      &ldquo;She may not feel any ill effects at present, but you may depend upon it,
      it will tell on her by-and-by. Besides, she does not attend to anything
      properly. At one time she was improving in neatness and orderly habits.
      Now, you surely must have seen how much less tidy her hair and dress have
      been.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have thought her hair looking rather rough,&rdquo; said Margaret
      disconsolately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No wonder,&rdquo; said Miss Winter, &ldquo;for Flora and Mary tell me she hardly
      spends five minutes over it in the morning, and with a book before her the
      whole time. If I send her up to make it fit to be seen, I meet with looks
      of annoyance. She leaves her books in all parts of the school-room for
      Mary to put away, and her table drawer is one mass of confusion. Her
      lessons she does well enough, I own, though what I should call much too
      fast; but have you looked at her work lately?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She does not work very well,&rdquo; said Margaret, who was at that moment,
      though Miss Winter did not know it, re-gathering a poor child&rsquo;s frock that
      Ethel had galloped through with more haste than good speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She works a great deal worse than little Blanche,&rdquo; said Miss Winter, &ldquo;and
      though it may not be the fashion to say so in these days, I consider good
      needlework far more important than accomplishments. Well, then, Margaret,
      I should wish you only just to look at her writing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Miss Winter opened a French exercise-book, certainly containing
      anything but elegant specimens of penmanship. Ethel&rsquo;s best writing was an
      upright, disjointed niggle, looking more like Greek than anything else,
      except where here and there it made insane efforts to become running-hand,
      and thereby lost its sole previous good quality of legibility, while the
      lines waved about the sheet in almost any direction but the horizontal.
      The necessity she believed herself under of doing what Harry called
      writing with the end of her nose, and her always holding her pen with her
      fingers almost in the ink, added considerably to the difficulty of the
      performance. This being at her best, the worst may be supposed to be
      indescribable, when dashed off in a violent hurry, and considerably
      garnished with blots. Margaret thought she had seen the worst, and was
      sighing at being able to say nothing for it, when Miss Winter confounded
      her by turning a leaf, and showing it was possible to make a still wilder
      combination of scramble, niggle, scratch, and crookedness&mdash;and this
      was supposed to be an amended edition! Miss Winter explained that Ethel
      had, in an extremely short time, performed an exercise in which no fault
      could be detected except the writing, which was pronounced to be too
      atrocious to be shown up to M. Ballompre. On being desired to write it
      over again, she had obeyed with a very bad grace, and some murmurs about
      Cocksmoor, and produced the second specimen, which, in addition to other
      defects, had some elisions from arrant carelessness, depriving it of its
      predecessor&rsquo;s merits of being good French.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Winter had been so provoked that she believed this to be an effect of
      ill temper, and declared that she should certainly have kept Ethel at home
      to write it over again, if it had not so happened that Dr. May had
      proposed to walk part of the way with her and Richard, and the governess
      was unwilling to bring her into disgrace with him. Margaret was so
      grateful to her for this forbearance, that it disposed her to listen the
      more patiently to the same representations put in, what Miss Winter
      fancied, different forms. Margaret was much perplexed. She could not but
      see much truth in what Miss Winter said, and yet she could not bear to
      thwart Ethel, whom she admired with her whole heart; and that dry
      experience, and prejudiced preciseness, did not seem capable of entering
      into her sister&rsquo;s thirst for learning and action. When Miss Winter said
      Ethel would grow up odd, eccentric, and blue, Margaret was ready to answer
      that she would be superior to every one; and when the governess urged her
      to insist on Cocksmoor being given up, she felt impatient of that utter
      want of sympathy for the good work.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that evening Margaret longed for a quiet time to reflect, but it never
      came till she was in bed; and when she had made up her mind how to speak
      to Ethel, it was five times harder to secure her alone. Even when Margaret
      had her in the room by herself, she looked wild and eager, and said she
      could not stay, she had some Thucydides to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you stay with me a little while, quietly?&rdquo; said Margaret; &ldquo;we
      hardly ever have one of our talks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to vex you, dear Margaret; I like nothing so well, only we
      are never alone, and I&rsquo;ve no time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray do spare me a minute, Ethel, for I have something that I must say to
      you, and I am afraid you won&rsquo;t like it&mdash;so do listen kindly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;Miss Winter has been talking to you. I know she said
      she would tell you that she wants me to give up Cocksmoor. You aren&rsquo;t
      dreaming of it, Margaret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, dear Ethel, I should be very sorry, but one thing I am sure of,
      that there is something amiss in your way of going on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she show you that horrid exercise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I know it was baddish writing, but just listen, Margaret. We
      promised six of the children to print them each a verse of a hymn on a
      card to learn. Ritchie did three, and then could not go on, for the book
      that the others were in was lost till last evening, and then he was
      writing for papa. So I thought I would do them before we went to
      Cocksmoor, and that I should squeeze time out of the morning; but I got a
      bit of Sophocles that was so horridly hard it ate up all my time, and I
      don&rsquo;t understand it properly now; I must get Norman to tell me. And that
      ran in my head and made me make a mistake in my sum, and have to begin it
      again. Then, just as I thought I had saved time over the exercise, comes
      Miss Winter and tells me I must do it over again, and scolds me besides
      about the ink on my fingers. She would send me up at once to get it off,
      and I could not find nurse and her bottle of stuff for it, so that wasted
      ever so much more time, and I was so vexed that, really and truly, my hand
      shook and I could not write any better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I thought it looked as if you had been in one of your agonies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she thought I did it on purpose, and that made me angry, and so we
      got into a dispute, and away went all the little moment I might have had,
      and I was forced to go to Cocksmoor as a promise breaker!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think you had better have taken pains at first?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, so I did with the sense, but I hadn&rsquo;t time to look at the writing
      much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would have made better speed if you had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I know I was wrong, but it is a great plague altogether. Really,
      Margaret, I shan&rsquo;t get Thucydides done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must wait a little longer, please, Ethel, for I want to say to you
      that I am afraid you are doing too much, and that prevents you from doing
      things well, as you were trying to do last autumn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not thinking of my not going to Cocksmoor?&rdquo; cried Ethel
      vehemently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to consider what is to be done, dear Ethel. You thought, last
      autumn, a great deal of curing your careless habits, now you seem not to
      have time to attend. You can do a great deal very fast, I know, but isn&rsquo;t
      it a pity to be always in a hurry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t Cocksmoor that is the reason,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; you did pretty well when you began, but you know that was in the
      holidays, when you had no Latin and Greek to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but, Margaret, they won&rsquo;t take so much time when I have once got over
      the difficulties, and see my way, but just now they have put Norman into
      such a frightfully difficult play, that I can hardly get on at all with
      it, and there&rsquo;s a new kind of Greek verses, too, and I don&rsquo;t make out from
      the book how to manage them. Norman showed me on Saturday, but mine won&rsquo;t
      be right. When I&rsquo;ve got over that, I shan&rsquo;t be so hurried.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Norman will go on to something harder, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say I shall be able to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you might, but I want you to consider if you are not working
      beyond what can be good for anybody. You see Norman is much cleverer than
      most boys, and you are a year younger; and besides doing all his work at
      the head of the school, his whole business of the day, you have Cocksmoor
      to attend to, and your own lessons, besides reading all the books that
      come into the house. Now isn&rsquo;t that more than is reasonable to expect any
      head and hands to do properly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if I can do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But can you, dear Ethel? Aren&rsquo;t you always racing from one thing to
      another, doing them by halves, feeling hunted, and then growing vexed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know I have been cross lately,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s the being so
      bothered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why are you bothered? Isn&rsquo;t it that you undertake too much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you have me do?&rdquo; said Ethel, in an injured, unconvinced voice.
      &ldquo;Not give up my children?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Margaret; &ldquo;but don&rsquo;t think me very unkind if I say, suppose you
      left off trying to keep up with Norman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Margaret! Margaret!&rdquo; and her eyes filled with tears. &ldquo;We have hardly
      missed doing the same every day since the first Latin grammar was put into
      his hands!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it would be very hard,&rdquo; said Margaret; but Ethel continued, in a
      piteous tone, a little sentimental, &ldquo;From hie haec hoc up to Alcaics and
      beta Thukididou we have gone on together, and I can&rsquo;t bear to give it up.
      I&rsquo;m sure I can&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, Ethel, I really doubt whether you can. Do you know that Norman was
      telling papa the other day that it was very odd Dr. Hoxton gave them such
      easy lessons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel looked very much mortified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said Margaret kindly, &ldquo;we all know that men have more power
      than women, and I suppose the time has come for Norman to pass beyond you.
      He would not be cleverer than any one, if he could not do more than a girl
      at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has so much more time for it,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the very thing. Now consider, Ethel. His work, after he goes to
      Oxford, will be doing his very utmost&mdash;and you know what an utmost
      that is. If you could keep up with him at all, you must give your whole
      time and thoughts to it, and when you had done so&mdash;if you could get
      all the honours in the University&mdash;what would it come to? You can&rsquo;t
      take a first-class.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want one,&rdquo; said Ethel; &ldquo;I only can&rsquo;t bear not to do as Norman
      does, and I like Greek so much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And for that would you give up being a useful, steady daughter and sister
      at home? The sort of woman that dear mamma wished to make you, and a
      comfort to papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel was silent, and large tears were gathering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You own that that is the first thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ethel faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that it is what you fail in most?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, Ethel dearest, when you made up your mind to Cocksmoor, you knew
      those things could not be done without a sacrifice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but I didn&rsquo;t think it would be this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret was wise enough not to press her, and she sat down and sighed
      pitifully. Presently she said, &ldquo;Margaret, if you would only let me leave
      off that stupid old French, and horrid dull reading with Miss Winter, I
      should have plenty of time for everything; and what does one learn by
      hearing Mary read poetry she can&rsquo;t understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You work, don&rsquo;t you? But indeed, Ethel, don&rsquo;t say that I can let you
      leave off anything. I don&rsquo;t feel as if I had that authority. If it be done
      at all, it must be by papa&rsquo;s consent, and if you wish me to ask him about
      it, I will, only I think it would vex Miss Winter; and I don&rsquo;t think dear
      mamma would have liked Greek and Cocksmoor to swallow up all the little
      common ladylike things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel made two or three great gulps; &ldquo;Margaret, must I give up everything,
      and forget all my Latin and Greek?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think that would be a great pity,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;If you were
      to give up the verse-making, and the trying to do as much as Norman, and
      fix some time in the day&mdash;half an hour, perhaps&mdash;for your Greek,
      I think it might do very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Ethel, much relieved; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you don&rsquo;t want me to
      leave it all off. I hope Norman won&rsquo;t be vexed,&rdquo; she added, looking a
      little melancholy.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Norman had not by any means the sort of sentiment on the subject that
      she had. &ldquo;Of course, you know, Ethel,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it must have come to this
      some time or other, and if you find those verses too hard, and that they
      take up too much of your time, you had better give them up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel did not like anything to be said to be too hard for her, and was
      very near pleading she only wanted time, but some recollection came across
      her, and presently she said, &ldquo;I suppose it is a wrong sort of ambition to
      want to learn more, in one&rsquo;s own way, when one is told it is not good for
      one. I was just going to say I hated being a woman, and having these
      tiresome little trifles&mdash;my duty&mdash;instead of learning, which is
      yours, Norman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you did not,&rdquo; said Norman, &ldquo;for it would have been very silly of
      you; and I assure you, Ethel, it is really time for you to stop, or you
      would get into a regular learned lady, and be good for nothing. I don&rsquo;t
      mean that knowing more than other people would make you so, but minding
      nothing else would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This argument from Norman himself did much to reconcile Ethel&rsquo;s mind to
      the sacrifice she had made; and when she went to bed, she tried to work
      out the question in her own mind, whether her eagerness for classical
      learning was a wrong sort of ambition, to know what other girls did not,
      and whether it was right to crave for more knowledge than was thought
      advisable for her. She only bewildered herself, and went to sleep before
      she had settled anything, but that she knew she must make all give way to
      papa first, and, secondly, to Cocksmoor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Margaret had told her father all that had passed. He was only
      surprised to hear that Ethel had kept up so long with Norman, and thought
      that it was quite right that she should not undertake so much, agreeing
      more entirely than Margaret had expected with Miss Winter&rsquo;s view, that it
      would be hurtful to body as well as mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is perfectly ridiculous to think of her attempting it!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am
      glad you have put a stop to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad I have,&rdquo; said Margaret; &ldquo;and dear Ethel behaved so very well.
      If she had resisted, it would have puzzled me very much, I must have asked
      you to settle it. But it is very odd, papa, Ethel is the one of them all
      who treats me most as if I had real authority over her; she lets me scold
      her, asks my leave, never seems to recollect for a moment how little older
      I am, and how much cleverer she is. I am sure I never should have
      submitted so readily. And that always makes it more difficult to me to
      direct her; I don&rsquo;t like to take upon me with her, because it seems wrong
      to have her obeying me as if she were a mere child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is a fine creature,&rdquo; said Dr. May emphatically. &ldquo;It just shows the
      fact, the higher the mind the readier the submission. But you don&rsquo;t mean
      that you have any difficulty with the others?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, no. Flora never could need any interference, especially from me,
      and Mary is a thorough good girl. I only meant that Ethel lays herself out
      to be ruled in quite a remarkable way. I am sure, though she does love
      learning, her real love is for goodness and for you, papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel would have thought her sacrifice well paid for, had she seen her
      father&rsquo;s look of mournful pleasure.

      CHAPTER XIX.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     O ruthful scene! when from a nook obscure,
     His little sister doth his peril see,
     All playful as she sate, she grows demure,
     She finds full soon her wonted spirits flee,
     She meditates a prayer to set him free.
                                          SHENSTONE.
</pre>
    <p>
      The setting sun shone into the great west window of the school at
      Stoneborough, on its bare walls, the masters&rsquo; desks, the forms polished
      with use, and the square, inky, hacked and hewed chests, carved with the
      names of many generations of boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      About six or eight little boys were clearing away the books or papers that
      they, or those who owned them as fags, had left astray, and a good deal of
      talk and laughing was going on among them. &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; exclaimed one, &ldquo;here has
      Harrison left his book behind him that he was showing us the gladiators
      in!&rdquo; and, standing by the third master&rsquo;s desk, he turned over a page or
      two of Smith&rsquo;s &lsquo;Antiquities&rsquo;, exclaiming, &ldquo;It is full of pictures&mdash;here&rsquo;s
      an old man blowing the bellows&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see!&rdquo; cried Tom May, precipitating himself across the benches and
      over the desk, with so little caution, that there was an outcry; and, to
      his horror, he beheld the ink spilled over Mr. Harrison&rsquo;s book, while,
      &ldquo;There, August! you&rsquo;ve been and done it!&rdquo; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll catch it!&rdquo; resounded on
      all sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What good will staring with your mouth open do!&rdquo; exclaimed Edward
      Anderson, the eldest present. &ldquo;Here! a bit of blotting-paper this moment!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom, dreadfully frightened, handed a sheet torn from an old paper-case
      that he had inherited from Harry, saying despairingly, &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t take it
      out, will it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, little stupid head, but don&rsquo;t you see, I&rsquo;m stopping it from running
      down the edges, or soaking in. He won&rsquo;t be the wiser till he opens it
      again at that place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When he does, he will,&rdquo; said the bewildered Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him. It won&rsquo;t tell tales.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming!&rdquo; cried another boy, &ldquo;he is close at the door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anderson hastily shut the book over the blotting-paper, which he did not
      venture to retain in his hand, dragged Tom down from the desk, and was
      apparently entirely occupied with arranging his own box, when Mr. Harrison
      came in. Tom crouched behind the raised lid, quaking in every limb,
      conscious he ought to confess, but destitute of resolution to do so, and,
      in a perfect agony as the master went to his desk, took up the book, and
      carried it away, so unconscious, that Larkins, a great wag, only waited
      till his back was turned, to exclaim, &ldquo;Ha! old fellow, you don&rsquo;t know what
      you&rsquo;ve got there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo! May junior, will you never leave off staring? you won&rsquo;t see a bit
      farther for it,&rdquo; said Edward Anderson, shaking him by the ear; &ldquo;come to
      your senses, and know your friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll open it!&rdquo; gasped Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he will, but I&rsquo;d bet ninety to one, it is not at that page, or if he
      does, it won&rsquo;t tell tales, unless, indeed, he happened to see you standing
      there, crouching and shaking. That&rsquo;s the right way to bring him upon you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But suppose he opens it, and knows who was in school?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What then? D&rsquo;ye think we can&rsquo;t stand by each other, and keep our own
      counsel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the blotting-paper&mdash;suppose he knows that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a laugh all round at this, &ldquo;as if Harrison knew everyone&rsquo;s
      blotting-paper!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but Harry used to write his name all over his&mdash;see&mdash;and
      draw Union Jacks on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he did, the date is not there. Do you think the ink is going to say
      March 2nd? Why should not July have done it last half?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;July would have told if he had,&rdquo; said Larkins. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s no go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay! That&rsquo;s the way&mdash;the Mays are all like girls&mdash;can&rsquo;t keep a
      secret&mdash;not one of them. There, I&rsquo;ve done more for you than ever one
      of them would have done&mdash;own it&mdash;and he strode up to Tom, and
      grasped his wrists, to force the confession from him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but he&rsquo;ll ask when he finds it out&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him. We know nothing about it. Don&rsquo;t be coming the good boy over me
      like your brothers. That won&rsquo;t do&mdash;I know whose eyes are not too
      short-sighted to read upside down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom shrank and looked abject, clinging to the hope that Mr. Harrison would
      not open the book for weeks, months, or years.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the next morning his heart died within him, when he beheld the
      unfortunate piece of blotting-paper, displayed by Mr. Harrison, with the
      inquiry whether any one knew to whom it belonged, and what made it worse
      was, that his sight would not reach far enough to assure him whether
      Harry&rsquo;s name was on it, and he dreaded that Norman or Hector Ernescliffe
      should recognise the nautical designs. However, both let it pass, and no
      one through the whole school attempted to identify it. One danger was
      past, but the next minute Mr. Harrison opened his Smith&rsquo;s &lsquo;Antiquities&rsquo; at
      the page where stood the black witness. Tom gazed round in despair, he
      could not see his brother&rsquo;s face, but Edward Anderson, from the second
      form, returned him a glance of contemptuous encouragement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This book,&rdquo; said Mr. Harrison, &ldquo;was left in school for a quarter of an
      hour yesterday. When I opened it again, it was in this condition. Do any
      of you know how it happened?&rdquo; A silence, and he continued, &ldquo;Who was in
      school at this time? Anderson junior, can you tell me anything of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know nothing of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cold chills crept over Tom, as Mr. Harrison looked round to refresh his
      memory. &ldquo;Larkins, do you know how this happened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; said Larkins boldly, satisfying his conscience because he had
      not seen the manner of the overthrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ernescliffe, were you there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom&rsquo;s timid heart fluttered in dim hope that he had been overlooked, as
      Mr. Harrison paused, then said, &ldquo;Remember, it is concealment that is the
      evil, not the damage to the book. I shall have a good opinion ever after
      of a boy honest enough to confess, May junior, I saw you,&rdquo; he added,
      hopefully and kindly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid to speak out if you did meet with a
      mischance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom coloured and turned pale. Anderson and Larkins grimaced at him, to
      remind him that they had told untruths for his sake, and that he must not
      betray them. It was the justification he wanted; he was relieved to fancy
      himself obliged to tell the direct falsehood, for which a long course of
      petty acted deceits had paved the way, for he was in deadly terror of the
      effects of truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo; He could hardly believe he had said the words, or that they
      would be so readily accepted, for Mr. Harrison had only the impression
      that he knew who the guilty person was, and would not tell, and,
      therefore, put no more questions to him, but, after a few more vain
      inquiries, was baffled, and gave up the investigation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom thought he should have been very unhappy; he had always heard that
      deceit was a heavy burden, and would give continual stings, but he was
      surprised to find himself very comfortable on the whole, and able to
      dismiss repentance as well as terror. His many underhand ways with Richard
      had taken away the tenderness of his conscience, though his knowledge of
      what was right was clear; and he was quite ready to accept the feeling
      prevalent at Stoneborough, that truth was not made for schoolboys.
    </p>
    <p>
      The axiom was prevalent, but not universal, and parties were running high.
      Norman May, who as head boy had, in play-hours, the responsibility, and
      almost the authority of a master, had taken higher ground than was usual
      even with the well-disposed; and felt it his duty to check abuses and
      malpractices that his predecessors had allowed. His friend, Cheviot, and
      the right-minded set, maintained his authority with all their might; but
      Harvey Anderson regarded his interference as vexatious, always took the
      part of the offenders, and opposed him in every possible way, thus
      gathering as his adherents not only the idle and mischievous, but the weak
      and mediocre, and, among this set, there was a positive bitterness of
      feeling to May, and all whom they considered as belonging to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In shielding Tom May and leading him to deceive, the younger Anderson had
      gained a conquest&mdash;in him the Mays had fallen from that pinnacle of
      truth which was a standing reproach to the average Stoneborough code&mdash;and,
      from that time, he was under the especial patronage of his friend. He was
      taught the most ingenious arts of saying a lesson without learning it, and
      of showing up other people&rsquo;s tasks; whispers and signs were directed to
      him to help him out of difficulties, and he was sought out and put forward
      whenever a forbidden pleasure was to be enjoyed by stealth. These were his
      stimulants under a heavy bondage; he was teased and frightened, bullied
      and tormented, whenever it was the fancy of Ned Anderson and his
      associates to make his timidity their sport; he was scorned and
      ill-treated, and driven, by bodily terror, into acts alarming to his
      conscience, dangerous in their consequences, and painful in the
      perpetration; and yet, among all his sufferings, the little coward dreaded
      nothing so much as truth, though it would have set him free at once from
      this wretched tyranny.
    </p>
    <p>
      Excepting on holidays, and at hours when the town-boys were allowed to go
      home, there were strict rules confining all except the sixth form to their
      bounds, consisting of two large courts, and an extensive field bordered by
      the river and the road. On the opposite side of the bridge was a turnpike
      gate, where the keeper exposed stalls of various eatables, very popular
      among the boys, chiefly because they were not allowed to deal there.
      Ginger-beer could also be procured, and there were suspicions that the
      bottles so called contained something contraband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;August,&rdquo; said Norman, as they were coming home from school one evening,
      &ldquo;did I see you coming over the bridge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom would not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you have been at Ballhatchet&rsquo;s gate? I can&rsquo;t think what could take you
      there. If you want tarts, I am sure poor old Betty&rsquo;s are just as good.
      What made you go there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, mind you don&rsquo;t do it again, or I shall have to take you in hand,
      which I shall be very sorry to do. That man is a regular bad character,
      and neither my father nor Dr. Hoxton would have one of us have anything to
      do with him, as you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom was in hopes it was over, but Norman went on. &ldquo;I am afraid you are
      getting into a bad way. Why won&rsquo;t you mind what I have told you plenty of
      times before, that no good comes of going after Ned Anderson, and
      Axworthy, and that set. What were you doing with them to-day?&rdquo; But,
      receiving no answer, he went on. &ldquo;You always sulk when I speak to you. I
      suppose you think I have no right to row you, but I do it to save you from
      worse. You can&rsquo;t never be found out.&rdquo; This startled Tom, but Norman had no
      suspicion. &ldquo;If you go on, you will get into some awful scrape, and papa
      will be grieved. I would not, for all the world, have him put out of heart
      about you. Think of him, Tom, and try to keep straight.&rdquo; Tom would say
      nothing, only reflecting that his elder brother was harder upon him than
      any one else would be, and Norman grew warmer. &ldquo;If you let Anderson junior
      get hold of you, and teach you his tricks, you&rsquo;ll never be good for
      anything. He seems good-natured now, but he will turn against you, as he
      did with Harry. I know how it is, and you had better take my word, and
      trust to me and straightforwardness, when you get into a mess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in no scrape,&rdquo; said Tom, so doggedly, that Norman lost patience, and
      spoke with more displeasure. &ldquo;You will be then, if you go out of bounds,
      and run Anderson&rsquo;s errands, and shirk work. You&rsquo;d better take care. It is
      my place to keep order, and I can&rsquo;t let you off for being my brother; so
      remember, if I catch you going to Ballhatchet&rsquo;s again, you may make sure
      of a licking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So the warning closed&mdash;Tom more alarmed at the aspect of right, which
      he fancied terrific, and Norman with some compunction at having lost
      temper and threatened, when he meant to have gained him by kindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norman recollected his threat with a qualm of dismay when, at the end of
      the week, as he was returning from a walk with Cheviot, Tom darted out of
      the gate-house. He was flying across the bridge, with something under his
      arm, when Norman laid a detaining hand on his collar, making a sign at the
      same time to Cheviot to leave them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; said Norman sternly, marching Tom into the
      field. &ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve been there again. What&rsquo;s that under your jacket?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only&mdash;only what I was sent for,&rdquo; and he tried to squeeze it under
      the flap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it? a bottle&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only&mdash;only a bottle of ink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norman seized it, and gave Tom a fierce angry shake, but the indignation
      was mixed with sorrow. &ldquo;Oh, Tom, Tom, these fellows have brought you a
      pretty pass. Who would have thought of such a thing from us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom cowered, but felt only terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak truth,&rdquo; said Norman, ready to shake it out of him; &ldquo;is this for
      Anderson junior?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Under those eyes, flashing with generous, sorrowful wrath, he dared not
      utter another falsehood, but Anderson&rsquo;s threats chained him, and he
      preferred his thraldom to throwing himself on the mercy of his brother who
      loved him. He would not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad it is not for yourself,&rdquo; said Norman; &ldquo;but do you remember what
      I said, in case I found you there again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; cried the boy. &ldquo;I would never have gone if they had
      not made me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Made you?&rdquo; said Norman, disdainfully, &ldquo;how?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They would have thrashed me&mdash;they pinched my fingers in the box&mdash;they
      pulled my ears&mdash;oh, don&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor little fellow!&rdquo; said Norman; &ldquo;but it is your own fault. If you won&rsquo;t
      keep with me, or Ernescliffe, of course they will bully you. But I must
      not let you off&mdash;I must keep my word!&rdquo; Tom cried, sobbed, and
      implored in vain. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and now, don&rsquo;t howl! I had
      rather no one knew it. It will soon be over. I never thought to have this
      to do to one of us.&rdquo; Tom roared and struggled, till, releasing him, he
      said, &ldquo;There, that will do. Stop bellowing, I was obliged, and I can&rsquo;t
      have hurt you much, have I?&rdquo; he added more kindly, while Tom went on
      crying, and turning from him. &ldquo;It is nothing to care about, I am sure;
      look up;&rdquo; and he pulled down his hands. &ldquo;Say you are sorry&mdash;speak the
      truth&mdash;keep with me, and no one shall hurt you again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Very different this from Tom&rsquo;s chosen associates; but he was still
      obdurate, sullen, and angry, and would not speak, nor open his heart to
      those kind words. After one more, &ldquo;I could not help it, Tom, you&rsquo;ve no
      business to be sulky,&rdquo; Norman took up the bottle, opened it, smelled, and
      tasted, and was about to throw it into the river; when Tom exclaimed, &ldquo;Oh,
      don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t! what will they do to me? give it to me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did they give you the money to pay for it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; let me have it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fourpence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll settle that,&rdquo; and the bottle splashed in the river. &ldquo;Now then, Tom,
      don&rsquo;t brood on it any more. Here&rsquo;s a chance for you of getting quit of
      their errands. If you will keep in my sight. I&rsquo;ll take care no one bullies
      you, and you may still leave off these disgraceful tricks, and do well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Tom&rsquo;s evil spirit whispered that Norman had beaten him, that he should
      never have any diversion again, and that Anderson would punish him; and
      there was a sort of satisfaction in seeing that his perverse silence
      really distressed his brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will go on in this way, I can&rsquo;t help it, but you&rsquo;ll be sorry some
      day,&rdquo; said Norman, and he walked thoughtfully on, looking back to see
      whether Tom was following, as he did slowly, meditating on the way how he
      should avert his tyrant&rsquo;s displeasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norman stood for a moment at the door, surveying the court, then walked up
      to a party of boys, and laid his hand on the shoulder of one, holding a
      silver fourpence to him. &ldquo;Anderson Junior,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s your money.
      I am not going to let Stoneborough School be turned into a gin palace. I
      give you notice, it is not to be. Now you are not to bully May junior for
      telling me. He did not, I found him out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leaving Anderson to himself he looked for Tom, but not seeing him, he
      entered the cloister, for it was the hour when he was used to read there,
      but he could not fix his mind. He went to the bench where he had lain on
      the examination day, and kneeling on it, looked out on the green grass
      where the graves were. &ldquo;Mother! mother!&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;have I been harsh
      to your poor little tender sickly boy? I couldn&rsquo;t help it. Oh! if you were
      but here! We are all going wrong! What shall I do? How should Tom be kept
      from this evil?&mdash;it is ruining him! mean, false, cowardly, sullen&mdash;all
      that is worst&mdash;and your son&mdash;oh! mother! and all I do only makes
      him shrink more from me. It will break my father&rsquo;s heart, and you will not
      be there to comfort him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norman covered his face with his hands, and a fit of bitter grief came
      over him. But his sorrow was now not what it had been before his father&rsquo;s
      resignation had tempered it, and soon it turned to prayer, resolution, and
      hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would try again to reason quietly with him, when the alarm of detection
      and irritation should have gone off, and he sought for the occasion; but,
      alas! Tom had learned to look on all reproof as &ldquo;rowing,&rdquo; and considered
      it as an additional injury from a brother, who, according to the Anderson
      view, should have connived at his offences, and turned a deafened ear and
      dogged countenance to all he said. The foolish boy sought after the
      Andersons still more, and Norman became more dispirited about him, greatly
      missing Harry, that constant companion and follower, who would have shared
      his perplexities, and removed half of them, in his own part of the school,
      by the influence of his high, courageous, and truthful spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime Richard was studying hard at home, with greater
      hopefulness and vigour than he had ever thrown into his work before.
      &ldquo;Suppose,&rdquo; Ethel had once said to him, &ldquo;that when you are a clergyman, you
      could be Curate of Cocksmoor, when there is a church there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When?&rdquo; said Richard, smiling at the presumption of the scheme, and yet it
      formed itself into a sort of definite hope. Perhaps they might persuade
      Mr. Ramsden to take him as a curate with a view to Cocksmoor, and this
      prospect, vague as it was, gave an object and hope to his studies. Every
      one thought the delay of his examination favourable to him, and he now
      read with a determination to succeed. Dr. May had offered to let him read
      with Mr. Harrison but Richard thought he was getting on pretty well, with
      the help Norman gave him; for it appeared that ever since Norman&rsquo;s return
      from London, he had been assisting Richard, who was not above being taught
      by a younger brother; while, on the other hand, Norman, much struck by his
      humility, would not for the world have published that he was fit to act as
      his elder&rsquo;s tutor.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening, when the two boys came in from school, Tom gave a great
      start, and, pulling Mary by the sleeve, whispered, &ldquo;How came that book
      here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is Mr. Harrison&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know, but how came it here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard borrowed it to look out something, and Ethel brought it down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A little reassured, Tom took up an exciting story-book, and ensconced
      himself by the fire, but his agonies were great during the ensuing
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Norman,&rdquo; Ethel was exclaiming in delight, &ldquo;do you know this book?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Smith? Yes, it is in the school library.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s everything in it that one wants, I do believe. Here is such an
      account of ancient galleys&mdash;I never knew how they managed their banks
      of rowers before&mdash;oh! and the Greek houses&mdash;look at the pictures
      too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some of them are the same as Mr. Rivers&rsquo;s gems,&rdquo; said Norman, standing
      behind her, and turning the leaves, in search of a favourite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! what did I see? is that ink?&rdquo; said Flora, from the opposite side of
      the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, didn&rsquo;t you hear?&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;Mr. Harrison told Ritchie when he
      borrowed it, that unluckily one day this spring he left it in school, and
      some of the boys must have upset an inkstand over it; but, though he asked
      them all round, each denied it. How I should hate for such things to
      happen! and it was a prize-book too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While Ethel spoke she opened the marked page, to show the extent of the
      calamity, and as she did so Mary exclaimed, &ldquo;Dear me! how funny! why, how
      did Harry&rsquo;s blotting-paper get in there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom shrank into nothing, set his teeth, and pinched his fingers, ready to
      wish they were on Mary&rsquo;s throat, more especially as the words made some
      sensation. Richard and Margaret exchanged looks, and their father, who had
      been reading, sharply raised his eyes and said, &ldquo;Harry&rsquo;s blotting-paper!
      How do you know that, Mary?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is Harry&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said she, all unconscious, &ldquo;because of that anchor up in
      one corner, and the Union Jack in the other. Don&rsquo;t you see, Ethel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ethel; &ldquo;nobody drew that but Harry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, and there are his buttons,&rdquo; said Mary, much amused and delighted with
      these relics of her beloved Harry. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember one day last
      holidays, papa desired Harry to write and ask Mr. Ernescliffe what clothes
      he ought to have for the naval school, and all the time he was writing the
      letter, he was drawing sailors&rsquo; buttons on his blotting-paper. I wonder
      how ever it got into Mr. Harrison&rsquo;s book!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor Mary&rsquo;s honest wits did not jump to a conclusion quite so fast as
      other people&rsquo;s, and she little knew what she was doing when, as a great
      discovery, she exclaimed, &ldquo;I know! Harry gave his paper-case to Tom.
      That&rsquo;s the way it got to school!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom!&rdquo; exclaimed his father, suddenly and angrily, &ldquo;where are you going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To bed,&rdquo; muttered the miserable Tom, twisting his hands. A dead silence
      of consternation fell on all the room. Mary gazed from one to the other,
      mystified at the effect of her words, frightened at her father&rsquo;s loud
      voice, and at Tom&rsquo;s trembling confusion. The stillness lasted for some
      moments, and was first broken by Flora, as if she had caught at a
      probability. &ldquo;Some one might have used the first blotting-paper that came
      to hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come here, Tom,&rdquo; said the doctor, in a voice not loud, but trembling with
      anxiety; then laying his hand on his shoulder, &ldquo;Look in my face.&rdquo; Tom hung
      his head, and his father put his hand under his chin, and raised the pale
      terrified face. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid to tell us the meaning of this. If any of
      your friends have done it, we will keep your secret. Look up, and speak
      out. How did your blotting-paper come there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom had been attempting his former system of silent sullenness, but there
      was anger at Mary, and fear of his father to agitate him, and in his
      impatient despair at thus being held and questioned, he burst out into a
      violent fit of crying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t have you roaring here to distress Margaret,&rdquo; said Dr. May. &ldquo;Come
      into the study with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Tom, who seemed fairly out of himself, would not stir, and a screaming
      and kicking scene took place, before he was carried into the study by his
      brothers, and there left with his father. Mary, meantime, dreadfully
      alarmed, and perceiving that, in some way, she was the cause, had thrown
      herself upon Margaret, sobbing inconsolably, as she begged to know what
      was the matter, and why papa was angry with Tom&mdash;had she made him so?
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret caressed and soothed her to the best of her ability, trying to
      persuade her that, if Tom had done wrong, it was better for him it should
      be known, and assuring her that no one could think her unkind, nor a
      tell-tale; then dismissing her to bed, and Mary was not unwilling to go,
      for she could not bear to meet Tom again, only begging in a whisper to
      Ethel, &ldquo;that, if dear Tom had not done it, she would come and tell her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid there is no hope of that!&rdquo; sighed Ethel, as the door closed
      on Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all,&rdquo; said Flora, &ldquo;he has not said anything. If he has only done
      it, and not confessed, that is not so bad&mdash;it is only the usual
      fashion of boys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he been asked? Did he deny it?&rdquo; said Ethel, looking in Norman&rsquo;s face,
      as if she hardly ventured to put the question, and she only received
      sorrowful signs as answers. At the same moment Dr. May called him. No one
      spoke. Margaret rested her head on the sofa, and looked very mournful,
      Richard stood by the fire without moving limb or feature, Flora worked
      fast, and Ethel leaned back on an arm-chair, biting the end of a
      paper-knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor and Norman came back together. &ldquo;I have sent him up to bed,&rdquo;
       said Dr. May. &ldquo;I must take him to Harrison to-morrow morning. It is a
      terrible business!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he confessed it?&rdquo; said Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can hardly call such a thing a confession&mdash;I wormed it out bit by
      bit&mdash;I could not tell whether he was telling truth or not, till I
      called Norman in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he has not said anything more untrue&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he has though!&rdquo; said Dr. May indignantly. &ldquo;He said Ned Anderson put
      the paper there, and had been taking up the ink with it&mdash;&lsquo;twas his
      doing&mdash;then when I came to cross-examine him I found that though
      Anderson did take up the ink, it was Tom himself who knocked it down&mdash;I
      never heard anything like it&mdash;I never could have believed it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must all be Ned Anderson&rsquo;s doing!&rdquo; cried Flora. &ldquo;They are enough to
      spoil anybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid they have done him a great deal of harm,&rdquo; said Norman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what have you been about all the time?&rdquo; exclaimed the doctor, too
      keenly grieved to be just. &ldquo;I should have thought that with you at the
      head of the school, the child might have been kept out of mischief; but
      there have you been going your own way, and leaving him to be ruined by
      the very worst set of boys!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norman&rsquo;s colour rose with the extreme pain this unjust accusation caused
      him, and his voice, though low, was not without irritation, &ldquo;I have tried.
      I have not done as much as I ought, perhaps, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I think not, indeed!&rdquo; interrupted his father. &ldquo;Sending a boy there,
      brought up as he had been, without the least tendency to deceit&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here no one could see Norman&rsquo;s burning cheeks, and brow bent downwards in
      the effort to keep back an indignant reply, without bursting out in
      exculpation; and Richard looked up, while the three sisters all at once
      began, &ldquo;Oh, no, no, papa&rdquo;&mdash;and left Margaret to finish&mdash;&ldquo;Poor
      little Tom had not always been quite sincere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! and why was I left to send him to school without knowing it? The
      place of all others to foster deceit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was my fault, papa,&rdquo; said Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And mine,&rdquo; put in Richard; and she continued, &ldquo;Ethel told us we were very
      wrong, and I wish we had followed her advice. It was by far the best, but
      we were afraid of vexing you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every one seems to have been combined to hide what they ought not!&rdquo; said
      Dr. May, though speaking to her much more softly than to Norman, to whom
      he turned angrily again. &ldquo;Pray, how came you not to identify this paper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not know it,&rdquo; said Norman, speaking with difficulty. &ldquo;He ought
      never to have been sent to school,&rdquo; said the doctor&mdash;&ldquo;that tendency
      was the very worst beginning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a great pity; I was very wrong,&rdquo; said Margaret, in great concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not mean to blame you, my dear,&rdquo; said her father affectionately. &ldquo;I
      know you only meant to act for the best, but&mdash;&rdquo; and he put his hand
      over his face, and then came the sighing groan, which pained Margaret ten
      thousand times more than reproaches, and which, in an instant, dispersed
      all the indignation burning within Norman, though the pain remained at his
      father&rsquo;s thinking him guilty of neglect, but he did not like, at that
      moment, to speak in self-justification.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a short space, Dr. May desired to hear what were the deceptions to
      which Margaret had alluded, and made Norman tell what he knew of the
      affair of the blotted book. Ethel spoke hopefully when she had heard it.
      &ldquo;Well, do you know, I think he will do better now. You see, Edward made
      him conceal it, and he has been going on with it on his mind, and in that
      boy&rsquo;s power ever since; but now it is cleared up and confessed, he will
      begin afresh and do better. Don&rsquo;t you think so, Norman? don&rsquo;t you, papa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have more hope if I had seen anything like confession or
      repentance,&rdquo; said Dr. May; &ldquo;but that provoked me more than all&mdash;I
      could only perceive that he was sorry to be found out, and afraid of
      punishment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps, when he has recovered the first fright, he will come to his
      better self,&rdquo; said Margaret; for she guessed, what indeed was the case,
      that the doctor&rsquo;s anger on this first shock of the discovery of the fault
      he most abhorred had been so great, that a fearful cowering spirit would
      be completely overwhelmed; and, as there had been no sorrow shown for the
      fault, there had been none of that softening and relenting that won so
      much love and confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every one felt that talking only made them more unhappy, they tried to
      return to their occupations, and so passed the time till night. Then, as
      Richard was carrying Margaret upstairs, Norman lingered to say, &ldquo;Papa, I
      am very sorry you should think I neglected Tom. I dare say I might have
      done better for him, but, indeed, I have tried.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure you have, Norman. I spoke hastily, my boy&mdash;you will not
      think more of it. When a thing like this comes on a man, he hardly knows
      what he says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Harry were here,&rdquo; said Norman, anxious to turn from the real loss and
      grief, as well as to talk away that feeling of being apologised to, &ldquo;it
      would all do better. He would make a link with Tom, but I have so little,
      naturally, to do with the second form, that it is not easy to keep him in
      sight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, I know that very well. It is no one&rsquo;s fault but my own; I
      should not have sent him there without knowing him better. But you see how
      it is, Norman&mdash;I have trusted to her, till I have grown neglectful,
      and it is well if it is not the ruin of him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he will take a turn, as Ethel says,&rdquo; answered Norman cheerfully.
      &ldquo;Good-night, papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a blessing to be thankful for in you, at least,&rdquo; murmured the
      doctor to himself. &ldquo;What other young fellow of that age and spirit would
      have borne so patiently with my injustice? Not I, I am sure! a fine father
      I show myself to these poor children&mdash;neglect, helplessness, temper&mdash;Oh,
      Maggie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret had so bad a headache the next day that she could not come
      downstairs. The punishment was, they heard, a flogging at the time, and an
      imposition so long, that it was likely to occupy a large portion of the
      play-hours till the end of the half-year. His father said, and Norman
      silently agreed, &ldquo;a very good thing, it will keep him out of mischief;&rdquo;
       but Margaret only wished she could learn it for him, and took upon herself
      all the blame from beginning to end. She said little to her father, for it
      distressed him to see her grieved; he desired her not to dwell on the
      subject, caressed her, called her his comfort and support, and did all he
      could to console her, but it was beyond his power; her sisters, by
      listening to her, only made her worse. &ldquo;Dear, dear papa,&rdquo; she exclaimed,
      &ldquo;how kind he is! But he can never depend upon me again&mdash;I have been
      the ruin of my poor little Tom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Richard quietly, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see why you should put yourself
      into such a state about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This took Margaret by surprise. &ldquo;Have not I done very wrong, and perhaps
      hurt Tom for life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; said Richard. &ldquo;You and I made a mistake, but it does not
      follow that Tom would have kept out of this scrape, if we had told my
      father our notion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would not have been on my conscience,&rdquo; said Margaret&mdash;&ldquo;he would
      not have sent him to school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that,&rdquo; said Richard. &ldquo;At any rate we meant to do right, and
      only made a mistake. It was unfortunate, but I can&rsquo;t tell why you go and
      make yourself ill, by fancying it worse than it is. The boy has done very
      wrong, but people get cured of such things in time, and it is nonsense to
      fret as if he were not a mere child of eight years old. You did not teach
      him deceit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but I concealed it&mdash;papa is disappointed, when he thought he
      could trust me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! I suppose no one could expect never to make mistakes,&rdquo; said
      Richard, in his sober tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Self-sufficiency!&rdquo; exclaimed Margaret, &ldquo;that has been the root of all! Do
      you know, Ritchie, I believe I was expecting that I could always judge
      rightly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You generally do,&rdquo; said Richard; &ldquo;no one else could do half what you do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you have said, papa, and all of you, till you have spoilt me. I have
      thought it myself, Ritchie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; said Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But then,&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;I have grown to think much of it, and not like
      to be interfered with. I thought I could manage by myself, and when I said
      I would not worry papa, it was half because I liked the doing and settling
      all about the children myself. Oh! if it could have been visited in any
      way but by poor Tom&rsquo;s faults!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Richard, &ldquo;if you felt so, it was a pity, though I never
      should have guessed it. But you see you will never feel so again, and as
      Tom is only one, and there are nine to govern, it is all for the best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His deliberate common-sense made her laugh a little, and she owned he
      might be right. &ldquo;It is a good lesson against my love of being first. But
      indeed it is difficult&mdash;papa can so little bear to be harassed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He could not at first, but now he is strong and well, it is different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He looks terribly thin and worn still,&rdquo; sighed Margaret, &ldquo;so much older!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, I think he will never get back his young looks; but except his weak
      arm, he is quite well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then his&mdash;his quick way of speaking may do harm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that was what I feared for Tom,&rdquo; said Richard, &ldquo;and there was the
      mistake. I see it now. My father always is right in the main, though he is
      apt to frighten one at first, and it is what ought to be that he should
      rule his own house. But now, Margaret, it is silly to worry about it any
      more&mdash;let me fetch baby, and don&rsquo;t think of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Margaret allowed his reasonableness, and let herself be comforted.
      After all, Richard&rsquo;s solid soberness had more influence over her than
      anything else.

</pre>
    <p>
      The first shock of Tom&rsquo;s misdemeanour passed away, though it still gave
      many an anxious thought to such of the family as felt responsible for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girls were busily engaged in preparing an Easter feast for Cocksmoor.
      Mr. Wilmot was to examine the scholars, and buns and tea were provided, in
      addition to which Ethel designed to make a present to every one&mdash;a
      great task, considering that the Cocksmoor funds were reserved for
      absolute necessaries, and were at a very low ebb. So that twenty-five
      gifts were to be composed out of nothing!
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a grand turn-out of drawers of rubbish, all over Margaret,
      raising such a cloud of dust as nearly choked her. What cannot rubbish and
      willing hands effect! Envelopes and wafer boxes were ornamented with
      pictures, bags, needle-cases, and pincushions, beautiful balls, tippets,
      both of list and gay print, and even sun-bonnets and pinafores were
      contrived, to the supreme importance and delight of Mary and Blanche, who
      found it as good or better than play, and ranged their performances in
      rows, till the room looked like a bazaar. To provide for boys was more
      difficult; but Richard mended old toys, and repaired the frames of slates,
      and Norman&rsquo;s contribution of half-a-crown bought mugs, marbles, and penny
      knives, and there were even hopes that something would remain for bodkins,
      to serve as nozzles to the bellows, which were the pride of Blanche&rsquo;s
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never were Easter gifts the source of more pleasure to the givers,
      especially when the nursery establishment met Dr. Hoxton near the
      pastrycook&rsquo;s shop, and he bestowed on Blanche a packet of variegated
      sugar-plums, all of which she literally poured out at Ethel&rsquo;s feet,
      saying, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want them. Only let me have one for Aubrey, because he is
      so little. All the rest are for the poor children at Cocksmoor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After this, Margaret declared that Blanche must be allowed to buy the
      bodkin, and give her bellows to Jane Taylor, the only Cocksmoor child she
      knew, and to whom she always destined in turn every gift that she thought
      most successful.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Blanche went with Flora to the toy-shop, and there fell in love with a
      little writing-box, that so eclipsed the bellows, that she tried to
      persuade Flora to buy it for Jane Taylor, to be kept till she could write,
      and was much disappointed to hear that it was out of the question. Just
      then a carriage stopped, and from it stepped the pretty little figure of
      Meta Rivers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! how do you do? How delightful to meet you! I was wondering if we
      should! Little Blanche too!&rdquo; kissing her, &ldquo;and here&rsquo;s Mrs. Larpent&mdash;Mrs.
      Larpent&mdash;Miss Flora May. How is Miss May?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was all uttered in eager delight, and Flora, equally pleased,
      answered the inquiries. &ldquo;I hope you are not in a hurry,&rdquo; proceeded Meta;
      &ldquo;I want your advice. You know all about schools, don&rsquo;t you? I am come to
      get some Easter presents for our children, and I am sure you can help me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are the children little or big?&rdquo; asked Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! all sorts and sizes. I have some books for the great sensible ones,
      and some stockings and shoes for the tiresome stupid ones, but there are
      some dear little pets that I want nice things for. There&mdash;there&rsquo;s a
      doll that looks just fit for little curly-headed Annie Langley, don&rsquo;t you
      think so, Mrs. Larpent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The price of the doll was a shilling, and there were quickly added to it,
      boxes of toys, elaborate bead-work pincushions, polished blue and green
      boxes, the identical writing-case&mdash;even a small Noah&rsquo;s ark. Meta
      hardly asked the prices, which certainly were not extravagant, since she
      had nearly twenty articles for little more than a pound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa has given me a benefaction of £5 for my school-gifts,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;is
      not that charming? I wish you would come to the feast. Now, do! It is on
      Easter Tuesday. Won&rsquo;t you come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, I am afraid we can&rsquo;t. I should like it very much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never will come to me. You have no compassion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We should enjoy coming very much. Perhaps, in the summer, when Margaret
      is better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could not she spare any of you? Well, I shall talk to papa, and make him
      talk to Dr. May. Mrs. Larpent will tell you I always get my way. Don&rsquo;t I?
      Good-bye. See if I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She departed, and Flora returned to her own business; but Blanche&rsquo;s
      interest was gone. Dazzled by the more lavish gifts, she looked listlessly
      and disdainfully at bodkins, three for twopence. &ldquo;I wish I might have
      bought the writing-box for Janet Taylor! Why does not papa give us money
      to get pretty things for the children?&rdquo; said she, as soon as they came
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he is not so rich as Miss Rivers&rsquo;s papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flora was interrupted by meeting the Misses Anderson, who asked, &ldquo;Was not
      that carriage Mr. Rivers&rsquo;s of Abbotstoke Grange?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. We like Miss Rivers very much,&rdquo; said Flora, resolved to show that
      she was acquainted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! do you visit her? I knew he was a patient of Dr. May.&rdquo; Flora thought
      there was no need to tell that the only call had been owing to the rain,
      and continued, &ldquo;She has been begging us to come to her school feast, but I
      do not think we can manage it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, indeed! the Grange is very beautiful, is it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very,&rdquo; said Flora. &ldquo;Good-morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flora had a little uneasiness in her conscience, but it was satisfactory
      to have put down Louisa Anderson, who never could aspire to an intimacy
      with Miss Rivers. Her little sister looked up&mdash;&ldquo;Why, Flora, have you
      seen the Grange?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but papa and Norman said so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Blanche showed that the practical lesson on the pomps of the world was
      not lost on her, by beginning to wish they were as rich as Miss Rivers.
      Flora told her it was wrong to be discontented, but the answer was, &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t want it for myself, I want to have pretty things to give away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And her mind could not be turned from the thought by any attempt of her
      sister. Even when they met Dr. May coming out of the hospital, Blanche
      renewed the subject. She poured out the catalogue of Miss Rivers&rsquo;s
      purchases, making appealing attempts at looking under his spectacles into
      his eyes, and he perfectly understood the tenor of her song.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have had a sight, too, of little maidens preparing Easter gifts,&rdquo; said
      he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you, papa? What were they? Were they as nice as Miss Rivers&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but I thought they were the best sort of gifts, for I saw
      that plenty of kind thought and clever contrivance went to them, ay, and
      some little self-denial too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa, you look as if you meant something; but ours are nothing but nasty
      old rubbish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps some fairy, or something better, has brought a wand to touch the
      rubbish, Blanche; for I think that the maidens gave what would have been
      worthless kept, but became precious as they gave it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean the list of our flannel petticoats, papa, that Mary has made
      into a tippet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I meant Mary&rsquo;s own time and pains, as well as the tippet. Would
      she have done much good with them otherwise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she would have played. Oh! then you like the presents because they
      are our own making? I never thought of that. Was that the reason you did
      not give us any of your sovereigns to buy things with?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I want my sovereigns for the eleven gaping mouths at home,
      Blanche. But would not it be a pity to spoil your pleasure? You would have
      lost all the chattering and laughing and buzzing I have heard round
      Margaret of late, and I am quite sure Miss Rivers can hardly be as happy
      in the gifts that cost her nothing, as one little girl who gives her
      sugar-plums out of her own mouth!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Blanche clasped her papa&rsquo;s hand tight, and bounded five or six times.
      &ldquo;They are our presents, not yours,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Yes, I see. I like them
      better now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;Seeing Miss Rivers&rsquo;s must not take the shine
      out of yours, my little maids; for if you can&rsquo;t give much, you have the
      pleasure of giving the best of all, your labour of love.&rdquo; Then thinking
      on, and speaking to Flora, &ldquo;The longer I live, the more I see the blessing
      of being born in a state of life where you can&rsquo;t both eat your cake and
      give it away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flora never was at ease in a conversation with her father; she could not
      follow him, and did not like to show it. She answered aside from the mark,
      &ldquo;You would not have Blanche underrate Miss Rivers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed, she is as good and sweet a creature as ever came across me&mdash;most
      kind to Margaret, and loving to all the world. I like to see one whom care
      and grief have never set their grip upon. Most likely she would do like
      Ethel, if she had the opportunity, but she has not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So she has not the same merit?&rdquo; said Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t talk of merit. I mean that the power of sacrifice is a great
      advantage. The habit of small sacrifice that is made necessary in a large
      family is a discipline that only-children are without: and so, with regard
      to wealth, I think people are to be pitied who can give extensively out of
      such abundance that they can hardly feel the want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In effect, they can do much more,&rdquo; said Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not sure of that. They can, of course, but it must be at the cost of
      personal labour and sacrifice. I have often thought of the words, &lsquo;Silver
      and gold have I none, but such as I have give I thee.&rsquo; And &lsquo;such as we
      have&rsquo; it is that does the good; the gold, if we have it, but, at any rate,
      the personal influence; the very proof of sincerity, shown by the exertion
      and self-denial, tells far more than money lightly come by, lightly
      spent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean that a person who maintained a whole school would do less
      good than one who taught one child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the rich person take no pains, and leave the school to take care of
      itself&mdash;nay, if he only visit it now and then, and never let it
      inconvenience him, has he the least security that the scholars are
      obtaining any real good from it? If the teacher of the one child is doing
      his utmost, he is working for himself at least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose we could build, say our church and school, on Cocksmoor at once,
      and give our superintendence besides?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If things were ripe for it, the means would come. As it is, it is a fine
      field for Ethel and Richard. I believe it will be the making of them both.
      I am sure it is training Ethel, or making her train herself, as we could
      never have done without it. But here, come in and see old Mrs. Robins. A
      visit from you will cheer her up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flora was glad of the interruption, the conversation was uncomfortable to
      her. She almost fancied her papa was moralising for their good, but that
      he carried it too far, for wealthy people assuredly had it in their power
      to do great things, and might work as hard themselves; besides, it was
      finer in them, there was so much eclat in their stooping to charity. But
      her knowledge of his character would not allow her to think for a moment
      that he could say aught but from the bottom of his heart&mdash;no, it was
      one of his one-sided views that led him into paradox. &ldquo;It was just like
      papa,&rdquo; and so there was no need to attend to it. It was one of his
      enthusiasms, he was so very fond of Ethel, probably because of her
      likeness to himself. Flora thought Ethel put almost too forward&mdash;they
      all helped at Cocksmoor, and Ethel was very queer and unformed, and could
      do nothing by herself. The only thing Flora did keep in her mind was, that
      her papa had spoken to her, as if she were a woman compared with Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Blanche made her report of the conversation to Mary, &ldquo;that it was
      so nice; and now she did not care about Miss Rivers&rsquo;s fine presents at
      all, for papa said what one made oneself was better to give than what one
      bought. And papa said, too, that it was a good thing not to be rich, for
      then one never felt the miss of what one gave away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret, who overheard the exposition, thought it so much to Blanche&rsquo;s
      credit, that she could not help repeating it in the evening, after the
      little girl was gone to bed, when Mr. Wilmot had come in to arrange the
      programme for Cocksmoor. So the little fit of discontent and its occasion,
      the meeting with Meta Rivers, were discussed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Wilmot, &ldquo;those Riverses are open-handed. They really seem
      to have so much money, that they don&rsquo;t know what to do with it. My brother
      is ready to complain that they spoil his parish. It is all meant so well,
      and they are so kind-hearted and excellent, that it is a shame to find
      fault, and I tell Charles and his wife that their grumbling at such a
      squire proves them the most spoiled of all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indiscriminate liberality?&rdquo; asked the doctor. &ldquo;I should guess the old
      gentleman to be rather soft!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s one thing. The parish is so small, and there are so few to shower
      all this bounty on, and they are so utterly unused to country people. They
      seem to think by laying out money they can get a show set of peasants in
      rustic cottages, just as they have their fancy cows and poultry&mdash;all
      that offends the eye out of the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Making it a matter of taste,&rdquo; said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I would,&rdquo; said Norman aside to Ethel. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of getting
      oneself disgusted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One must not begin with showing dislike,&rdquo; began Ethel, &ldquo;or&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay&mdash;you like rags, don&rsquo;t you? but hush!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is just what I should expect of Mr. Rivers,&rdquo; said Dr. May; &ldquo;he has
      cultivated his taste till it is getting to be a disease, but his daughter
      has no lack of wit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not. Charles and Mary are very fond of her, but she is entirely
      inexperienced, and that is a serious thing with so much money to throw
      about. She pays people for sending their children to school, and keeping
      their houses tidy; and there is so much given away, that it is enough to
      take away all independence and motive for exertion. The people speculate
      on it, and take it as a right; by-and-by there will be a reaction&mdash;she
      will find out she is imposed upon, take offence, and for the rest of her
      life will go about saying how ungrateful the poor are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a pity good people won&rsquo;t have a little common-sense,&rdquo; said Dr. May.
      &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s something so bewitching in that little girl, that I can&rsquo;t
      give her up. I verily believe she will right herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have scarcely seen her,&rdquo; said Mr. Wilmot. &ldquo;She has won papa&rsquo;s heart by
      her kindness to me,&rdquo; said Margaret, smiling. &ldquo;You see her beautiful
      flowers? She seems to me made to lavish pleasures on others wherever she
      goes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, they are most kind-hearted,&rdquo; said Mr. Wilmot. &ldquo;It is only the
      excess of a virtue that could be blamed in them, and they are most
      valuable to the place. She will learn experience in time&mdash;I only hope
      she will not be spoiled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flora felt as if her father must be thinking his morning&rsquo;s argument
      confirmed, and she was annoyed. But she thought there was no reason why
      wealth should not be used sensibly, and if she were at the head of such an
      establishment as the Grange, her charity should be so well regulated as to
      be the subject of general approbation.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wanted to find some one else on her side, and, as they went to bed,
      she said to Ethel, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you wish we had some of this superfluity of the
      Riverses for poor Cocksmoor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish we had anything for Cocksmoor! Here&rsquo;s a great hole in my boot, and
      nurse says I must get a new pair, that is seven-and-sixpence gone! I shall
      never get the first pound made up towards building!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And pounds seem nothing to them,&rdquo; said Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but if they don&rsquo;t manage right with them! I&rsquo;ll tell you, Flora, I
      got into a fit of wishing the other day; it does seem such a grievous pity
      to see those children running to waste for want of daily teaching, and
      Jenny Hall had forgotten everything. I was vexed, and thought it was all
      no use while we could not do more; but just then I began to look out the
      texts Ritchie had marked for me to print for them to learn, and the first
      was, &lsquo;Be thou faithful over a few things, and I will make thee ruler over
      many things,&rsquo; and then I thought perhaps we were learning to be faithful
      with a few things. I am sure what they said to-night showed it was lucky
      we have not more in our hands. I should do wrong for ever with the little
      we have if it were not for Ritchie and Margaret. By the time we have
      really got the money together for the school, perhaps I shall have more
      sense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got the money! As if we ever could!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! we shall and will. It need not be more than £70, Ritchie says,
      and I have twelve shillings for certain, put out from the money for hire
      of the room, and the books and clothes, and, in spite of these horrid
      boots, I shall save something out of this quarter, half-a-crown at least.
      And I have another plan besides&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Flora had to go down to Margaret&rsquo;s room to bed. Flora was always ready
      to throw herself into the present, and liked to be the most useful person
      in all that went forward, so that no thoughts of greatness interfered with
      her enjoyment at Cocksmoor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house seemed wild that Easter Monday morning. Ethel, Mary, and
      Blanche, flew about in all directions, and in spite of much undoing of
      their own arrangements, finished their preparations so much too early,
      that, at half-past eleven, Mary complained that she had nothing to do, and
      that dinner would never come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many were the lamentations at leaving Margaret behind, but she answered
      them by talking of the treat of having papa all to herself, for he had
      lent them the gig, and promised to stay at home all the afternoon with
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first division started on foot directly after dinner, the real Council
      of education, as Norman called them, namely, Mr. Wilmot, Richard, Ethel,
      and Mary; Flora, the other member, waited to take care of Blanche and
      Aubrey, who were to come in the gig, with the cakes, tea-kettles, and
      prizes, driven by Norman. Tom and Hector Ernescliffe were invited to join
      the party, and many times did Mary wish for Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Supremely happy were the young people as they reached the common, and
      heard the shout of tumultuous joy, raised by their pupils, who were on the
      watch for them. All was now activity. Everybody tripped into Mrs. Green&rsquo;s
      house, while Richard and Ethel ran different ways to secure that the fires
      were burning, which they had hired, to boil their kettles, with the tea in
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then when the kitchen was so full that it seemed as if it could hold no
      more, some kind of order was produced, the children were seated on their
      benches, and, while the mothers stood behind to listen, Mr. Wilmot began
      to examine, as well as he could in so crowded an audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was progress. Yes, there was. Only three were as utterly rude and
      idealess as they used to be at Christmas. Glimmerings had dawned on most,
      and one&mdash;Una M&rsquo;Carthy&mdash;was fit to come forward to claim Mr.
      Wilmot&rsquo;s promise of a Prayer-book. She could really read and say the
      Catechism&mdash;her Irish wit and love of learning had outstripped all the
      rest&mdash;and she was the pride of Ethel&rsquo;s heart, fit, now, to present
      herself on equal terms with the Stoneborough set, as far as her sense was
      concerned&mdash;though, alas! neither present nor exhortation had
      succeeded in making her anything, in looks, but a picturesque
      tatterdemalion, her sandy elf locks streaming over a pair of eyes, so
      dancing and gracieuses, that it was impossible to scold her.
    </p>
    <p>
      With beating heart, as if her own success in life depended for ever on the
      way her flock acquitted themselves, Ethel stood by Mr. Wilmot, trying to
      read answers coming out of the dull mouths of her children, and looking
      exultingly at Richard whenever some good reply was made, especially when
      Una answered an unexpected question. It was too delightful to hear how
      well she remembered all the history up to the flood, and how prettily it
      came out in her Irish accent! That made up for all the atrocious stupidity
      of others, who, after being told every time since they had begun who gave
      their names, now chose to forget.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst, while the assembly were listening with admiration to the
      reading of the scholar next in proficiency to Una, a boy who could read
      words of five letters without spelling, there was a fresh squeezing at the
      door, and, the crowd opening as well as it could, in came Flora and
      Blanche, while Norman&rsquo;s head was seen for a moment in the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora&rsquo;s whisper to Ethel was her first discovery that the closeness and
      the heat of the room was nearly overpowering. Her excitement had made all
      be forgotten. &ldquo;Could not a window be opened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Green interfered&mdash;it had been nailed up because her husband had
      the rheumatiz!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Aubrey?&rdquo; asked Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With Norman. Norman said he would not let him go into the black-hole, so
      he has got him out of doors. Ethel, we must come out! You don&rsquo;t know what
      an atmosphere it is! Blanche, go out to Norman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flora, Flora! you don&rsquo;t consider,&rdquo; said Ethel, in an agony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes. It is not at all cold. Let them have their presents out of
      doors and eat their buns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard and Mr. Wilmot agreed with Flora, and the party were turned out.
      Ethel did own, when she was in the open air, &ldquo;that it had been rather
      hot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norman&rsquo;s face was a sight, as he stood holding Aubrey in his arms, to
      gratify the child&rsquo;s impatience. The stifling den, the uncouth aspect of
      the children, the head girl so very ragged a specimen, thoroughly revolted
      his somewhat fastidious disposition. This was Ethel&rsquo;s delight! to this she
      made so many sacrifices! this was all that her time and labour had
      effected! He did not wish to vex her but it was more than he could stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, Ethel was too much engrossed to look for sympathy. It was a fine
      spring day, and on the open space of the common the arrangements were
      quickly made. The children stood in a long line, and the baskets were
      unpacked. Flora and Ethel called the names, Mary and Blanche gave the
      presents, and assuredly the grins, courtesies, and pulls of the forelock
      they elicited, could not have been more hearty for any of Miss Rivers&rsquo;s
      treasures. The buns and the kettles of tea followed&mdash;it was perfect
      delight to entertainers and entertained, except when Mary&rsquo;s dignity was
      cruelly hurt by Norman&rsquo;s authoritatively taking a kettle out of her hands,
      telling her she would be the death of herself or somebody else, and
      reducing her to the mere rank of a bun distributor, which Blanche and
      Aubrey could do just as well; while he stalked along with a grave and
      resigned countenance, filling up the cups held out to him by timid-looking
      children. Mary next fell in with Granny Hall, who had gone into such an
      ecstasy over Blanche and Aubrey, that Blanche did not know which way to
      look; and Aubrey, in some fear that the old woman might intend to kiss
      him, returned the compliments by telling her she was &ldquo;ugly up in her
      face,&rdquo; at which she laughed heartily, and uttered more vehement
      benedictions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, the three best children, boys and girls, were to be made fit to
      be seen, and recommended by Mr. Wilmot to the Sunday-school and penny club
      at Stoneborough, and, this being proclaimed and the children selected, the
      assembly dispersed, Mr. Wilmot rejoicing Ethel and Richard by saying,
      &ldquo;Well, really, you have made a beginning. There is an improvement in tone
      among those children, that is more satisfactory than any progress they may
      have made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel&rsquo;s eyes beamed, and she hurried to tell Flora. Richard coloured and
      gave his quiet smile, then turned to put things in order for their return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you drive home, Richard?&rdquo; said Norman, coming up to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you wish it?&rdquo; said Richard, who had many minor arrangements to
      make, and would have preferred walking home independently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you, I have a headache, and walking may take it off,&rdquo; said
      Norman, taking off his hat and passing his fingers through his hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A headache again&mdash;I am sorry to hear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is only that suffocating den of yours. My head ached from the moment I
      looked into it. How can you take Ethel into such a hole, Richard? It is
      enough to kill her to go on with it for ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not so every day,&rdquo; said the elder brother quietly. &ldquo;It is a warm
      day, and there was an unusual crowd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall speak to my father,&rdquo; exclaimed Norman, with somewhat of the
      supercilious tone that he had now and then been tempted to address to his
      brother. &ldquo;It is not fit that Ethel should give up everything, health and
      all, to such a set as these. They look as if they had been picked out of
      the gutter&mdash;dirt, squalor, everything disgusting, and summer coming
      on, too, and that horrid place with no window to open! It is utterly
      unbearable!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard stooped to pick up a heavy basket, then smiled and said, &ldquo;You must
      get over such things as these if you mean to be a clergyman, Norman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever I am to be, it does not concern the girls being in such a place
      as this. I am surprised that you could suffer it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no answer&mdash;Richard was walking off with his basket, and
      putting it into the carriage. Norman was not pleased with himself, but
      thought it his duty to let his father know his opinion of Ethel&rsquo;s weekly
      resort. All he wished was to avoid Ethel herself, not liking to show her
      his sentiments, and he was glad to see her put into the gig with Aubrey
      and Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      They rushed into the drawing-room, full of glee, when they came home, all
      shouting their news together, and had not at first leisure to perceive
      that Margaret had some tidings for them in return. Mr. Rivers had been
      there, with a pressing invitation to his daughter&rsquo;s school-feast, and it
      had been arranged that Flora and Ethel should go and spend the day at the
      Grange, and their father come to dine, and fetch them home in the evening.
      Margaret had been much pleased with the manner in which the thing was
      done. When Dr. May, who seemed reluctant to accept the proposal that
      related to himself, was called out of the room, Mr. Rivers had, in a most
      kind manner, begged her to say whether she thought it would be painful to
      him, or whether it might do his spirits good. She decidedly gave her
      opinion in favour of the invitation, Mr. Rivers gained his point, and she
      had ever since been persuading her father to like the notion, and assuring
      him it need not be made a precedent for the renewal of invitations to dine
      out in the town. He thought the change would be pleasant for his girls,
      and had, therefore, consented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, papa, papa! thank you!&rdquo; cried Ethel, enraptured, as soon as he came
      into the room. &ldquo;How very kind of you! How I have wished to see the Grange,
      and all Norman talks about! Oh, dear! I am so glad you are going there
      too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what should you do with me?&rdquo; said Dr. May, who felt and looked
      depressed at this taking up of the world again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear! I should not like it at all without you! It would be no fun at
      all by ourselves. I wish Flora would come home. How pleased she will be!
      Papa, I do wish you would look as if you didn&rsquo;t mind it! I can&rsquo;t enjoy it
      if you don&rsquo;t like going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall when I am there, my dear,&rdquo; said the doctor affectionately,
      putting his arm around her as she stood by him. &ldquo;It will be a fine day&rsquo;s
      sport for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But can&rsquo;t you like it beforehand, papa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not just this minute, Ethel,&rdquo; said he, with his bright, sad smile. &ldquo;All I
      like just now is my girl&rsquo;s not being able to do without me; but we&rsquo;ll do
      the best we can. So your flock acquitted themselves brilliantly? Who is
      your Senior Wrangler?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel threw herself eagerly into the history of the examination, and had
      almost forgotten the invitation till she heard the front door open. Then
      it was not she, but Margaret, who told Flora&mdash;Ethel could not, as she
      said, enjoy what seemed to sadden her father. Flora received it much more
      calmly. &ldquo;It will be very pleasant,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;it was very kind of papa to
      consent. You will have Richard and Norman, Margaret, to be with you in the
      evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, as soon as they went upstairs, Ethel began to write down the list of
      prizes in her school journal, while Flora took out the best evening
      frocks, to study whether the crape looked fresh enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      The invitation was a convenient subject of conversation, for Norman had so
      much to tell his sisters of the curiosities they must look for at the
      Grange, that he was not obliged to mention Cocksmoor. He did not like to
      mortify Ethel by telling her his intense disgust, and he knew he was about
      to do what she would think a great injury by speaking to his father on the
      subject; but he thought it for her real welfare, and took the first
      opportunity of making to his father and Margaret a most formidable
      description of Ethel&rsquo;s black-hole. It quite alarmed Margaret, but the
      doctor smiled, saying, &ldquo;Ay, ay, I know the face Norman puts on if he looks
      into a cottage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Norman, with some mortification, &ldquo;all I know is, that my head
      ached all the rest of the day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely, but your head is not Ethel&rsquo;s, and there were twice as many
      people as the place was intended to hold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A stuffy hole, full of peat-smoke, and with a window that can&rsquo;t open at
      the best of times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peat-smoke is wholesome,&rdquo; said Dr. May, looking provoking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what it is, papa, or you would never let Ethel spend her
      life there. It is poisonous!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take care of Ethel,&rdquo; said Dr. May, walking off, and leaving Norman
      in a state of considerable annoyance at being thus treated. He broke out
      into fresh exclamations against the horrors of Cocksmoor, telling Margaret
      she had no idea what a den it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Norman, it can&rsquo;t be so very bad, or Richard would not allow it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard is deluded!&rdquo; said Norman; &ldquo;but if he chooses to run after dirty
      brats, why should he take Ethel there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Norman, you know it is all Ethel&rsquo;s doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know she has gone crazy after them, and given up all her Greek for
      it. It is past endurance!&rdquo; said Norman, who had worked himself up into
      great indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but surely, Norman, it is better they should do what they can for
      those poor creatures, than for Ethel to learn Greek.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that. Let those who are fit for nothing else go and drone
      over A B C with ragged children, if they like. It is just their vocation;
      but there is an order in everything, Margaret, and minds of a superior
      kind are intended for higher purposes, not to be wasted in this manner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether they are wasted,&rdquo; said Margaret, not quite liking
      Norman&rsquo;s tone, though she had not much to say to his arguments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not wasted? Not in doing what any one can do? I know what you&rsquo;ll say
      about the poor. I grant it, but high ability must be given for a purpose,
      not to be thrown away. It is common-sense, that some one must be meant to
      do the dirty work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see what you mean, Norman, but I don&rsquo;t quite like that to be called by
      such a name. I think&mdash;&rdquo; she hesitated. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think you dislike
      such things more than&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any one must abominate dirt and slovenliness. I know what you mean. My
      father thinks &lsquo;tis all nonsense in me, but his profession has made him
      insensible to such things, and he fancies every one else is the same! Now,
      Margaret, am I unreasonable?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure I don&rsquo;t know, dear Norman,&rdquo; said Margaret, hesitating, and
      feeling it her duty to say something; &ldquo;I dare say it was very
      disagreeable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you think, too, that I made a disturbance for nothing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed I don&rsquo;t, nor does dear papa. I have no doubt he will see
      whether it is proper for Ethel. All I think he meant is, that perhaps your
      not being well last winter has made you a little more sensitive in such
      things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norman paused, and coloured. He remembered the pain it had given him to
      find himself incapable of being of use to his father, and that he had
      resolved to conquer the weakness of nerve of which he was ashamed; but he
      did not like to connect this with his fastidious feelings of refinement.
      He would not own to himself that they were over nice, and, at the bottom
      of all this justification, rankled Richard&rsquo;s saying, that he who cared for
      such things was unfit for a clergyman. Norman&rsquo;s secret thought was, it was
      all very well for those who could only aspire to parish work in wretched
      cottages&mdash;people who could distinguish themselves were more useful at
      the university, forming minds, and opening new discoveries in learning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was Norman quite proof against the consciousness of daily excelling all
      his competitors? His superiority had become even more manifest this
      Easter, when Cheviot and Forder, the two elder boys whom he had
      outstripped, left the school, avowedly, because it was not worth while for
      them to stay, since they had so little chance of the Randall scholarship.
      Norman had now only to walk over the course, no one even approaching him
      but Harvey Anderson.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meta Rivers always said that fine weather came at her call, and so it did&mdash;glowing
      sunshine streaming over the shaven turf, and penetrating even the solid
      masses of the great cedar.
    </p>
    <p>
      The carriage was sent for the Misses May, and at two o&rsquo;clock they arrived.
      Flora, extremely anxious that Ethel should comport herself discreetly; and
      Ethel full of curiosity and eagerness, the only drawback her fears that
      her papa was doing what he disliked. She was not in the least shy, and did
      not think about her manner enough to be troubled by the consciousness that
      it had a good deal of abruptness and eagerness, and that her short sight
      made her awkward. Meta met them with outstretched hands and a face beaming
      with welcome. &ldquo;I told you I should get my way!&rdquo; she said triumphantly,
      and, after her warm greeting, she looked with some respect at the face of
      the Miss May who was so very clever. It certainly was not what she
      expected, not at all like either of the four sisters she had already seen&mdash;brown,
      sallow, and with that sharp long nose, and the eager eyes, and brow a
      little knit by the desire to see as far as she could. It was pleasanter to
      look at Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel left the talk chiefly to Flora&mdash;there was wonder and study
      enough for her in the grounds and garden, and when Mrs. Larpent tried to
      enter into conversation with her, she let it drop two or three times while
      she was peering hard at a picture and trying to make out its subject.
      However, when they all went out to walk to church, Ethel lighted up, and
      talked, admired, and asked questions in her quick, eager way, which
      interested Mrs. Larpent greatly. The governess asked after Norman, and no
      more was wanted to produce a volume of histories of his successes, till
      Flora turned as she walked before with Meta, saying, &ldquo;Why, Ethel, you are
      quite overwhelming Mrs. Larpent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But some civil answer convinced Ethel that what she said was interesting,
      and she would not be stopped in her account of their anxieties on the day
      of the examination. Flora was pleased that Meta, catching some words,
      begged to hear more, and Flora gave an account of the matter, soberer in
      terms, but quietly setting Norman at a much greater distance from all his
      competitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      After church came the feast in the school. It was a large commodious
      building. Meta declared it was very tiresome that it was so good inside,
      it was so ugly, she should never rest till papa had built her a real
      beauty. They found Mr. and Mrs. Charles Wilmot in the school, with a very
      nice well-dressed set of boys and girls, and&mdash;But there is no need to
      describe the roast-beef and plum-pudding, &ldquo;the feast ate merrily,&rdquo; and
      Ethel was brilliantly happy waiting on the children, and so was
      sunny-hearted Meta. Flora was too busy in determining what the Riverses
      might be thinking of her and her sister to give herself up to the
      enjoyment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel found a small boy looking ready to cry at an untouched slice of
      beef. She examined him whether he could cut it, and at last discovered
      that, as had been the case with one or two of her own brothers at the same
      age, meat was repugnant to him. In her vehement manner she flew off to
      fetch him some pudding, and hurrying up, as she thought, to Mr. Charles
      Wilmot, who had been giving it out, she thrust her plate between him and
      the dish, and had begun her explanation when she perceived it was a
      stranger, and she stood, utterly discomfited, not saying, &ldquo;I beg your
      pardon,&rdquo; but only blushing, awkward and confused, as he spoke to her, in a
      good-natured, hospitable manner, which showed her it must be Mr. Rivers.
      She obtained her pudding, and, turning hastily, retreated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meta,&rdquo; said Mr. Rivers, as his daughter came out of the school with him,
      for, open and airy as it was, the numbers and the dinner made him regard
      it as Norman had viewed the Cocksmoor room, &ldquo;was that one of the Miss
      Mays?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, papa, Ethel, the third, the clever one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought she must be one of them from her dress; but what a difference
      between her and the others!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Rivers was a great admirer of beauty, and Meta, brought up to be the
      same, was disappointed, but consoled herself by admiring Flora. Ethel,
      after the awkwardness was over, thought no more of the matter, but went on
      in full enjoyment of the feast. The eating finished, the making of presents
      commenced, and choice ones they were. The smiles of Meta and of the
      children were a pretty sight, and Ethel thought she had never seen
      anything so like a beneficent fairy. Mr. and Mrs. Wilmot said their words
      of counsel and encouragement, and, by five o&rsquo;clock, all was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am sorry!&rdquo; said Meta, &ldquo;Easter won&rsquo;t come again for a whole year,
      and it has been so delightful. How that dear little Annie smiled and
      nursed her doll! I wish I could see her show it to her mother! Oh, how
      nice it is! I am so glad papa brought me to live in the country. I don&rsquo;t
      think anything can be so charming in all the world as seeing little
      children happy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel could not think how the Wilmots could have found it in their heart
      to regret the liberality of this sweet damsel, on whom she began to look
      with Norman&rsquo;s enthusiastic admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was time for a walk round the grounds, Meta doing the honours to
      Flora, and Ethel walking with Mrs. Larpent. Both pairs were very good
      friends, and the two sisters admired and were charmed with the beauty of
      the gardens and conservatories&mdash;Ethel laying up a rich store of
      intelligence for Margaret; but still she was not entirely happy; her papa
      was more and more on her mind. He had looked dispirited at breakfast; he
      had a long hard day&rsquo;s work before him, and she was increasingly uneasy at
      the thought that it would be a painful effort to him to join them in the
      evening. Her mind was full of it when she was conducted, with Flora, to
      the room where they were to dress; and when Flora began to express her
      delight, her answer was only that she hoped it was not very unpleasant to
      papa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not worth while to be unhappy about that, Ethel. If it is an
      effort, it will be good for him when he is once here. I know he will enjoy
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I should think he would&mdash;I hope he will. He must like you to
      have such a friend as Miss Rivers. How pretty she is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Ethel, it is high time to dress. Pray make yourself look nice&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      twist up your hair in that any-how fashion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel sighed, then began talking fast about some hints on school-keeping
      which she had picked up for Cocksmoor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora&rsquo;s glossy braids were in full order, while Ethel was still struggling
      to get her plait smooth, and was extremely beholden to her sister for
      taking it into her own hands and doing the best with it that its thinness
      and roughness permitted. And then Flora pinched and pulled and arranged
      Ethel&rsquo;s frock, in vain attempts to make it sit like her own&mdash;those
      sharp high bones resisted all attempts to disguise them. &ldquo;Never mind,
      Flora, it is quite tidy, I am sure, there&mdash;do let me be in peace. You
      are like old nurse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So those are all the thanks I get?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, thank you very much, dear Flora. You are a famous person. How I
      wish Margaret could see that lovely mimosa!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, Ethel, do take care. Pray don&rsquo;t poke and spy when you come into the
      room, and don&rsquo;t frown when you are trying to see. I hope you won&rsquo;t have
      anything to help at dinner. Take care how you manage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try,&rdquo; said Ethel meekly, though a good deal tormented, as Flora went
      on with half a dozen more injunctions, closed by Meta&rsquo;s coming to fetch
      them. Little Meta did not like to show them her own bedroom&mdash;she
      pitied them so much when she thought of the contrast. She would have liked
      to put Flora&rsquo;s arm through her&rsquo;s, but she thought, it would look
      neglectful of Ethel; so she only showed the way downstairs. Ethel forgot
      all her sister&rsquo;s orders; for there stood her father, and she looked most
      earnestly at his face. It was cheerful, and his voice sounded well pleased
      as he greeted Meta; then resumed an animated talk with Mr. Rivers. Ethel
      drew as near him as she could; she had a sense of protection, and could
      open to full enjoyment when she saw him bright. At the first pause in the
      conversation, the gentlemen turned to the young ladies. Mr. Rivers began
      talking to Flora, and Dr. May, after a few pleasant words to Meta, went
      back to Ethel. He wanted her to see his favourite pictures&mdash;he led
      her up to them, made her put on his spectacles to see them better, and
      showed her their special merits. Mr. Rivers and the others joined them;
      Ethel said little, except a remark or two in answer to her papa, but she
      was very happy&mdash;she felt that he liked to have her with him; and
      Meta, too, was struck by the soundness of her few sayings, and the
      participation there seemed to be in all things between the father and
      daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      At dinner Ethel went on pretty well. She was next to her father, and was
      very glad to find the dinner so grand, that no side-dish fell to her lot
      to be carved. There was a great deal of pleasant talk, such as the girls
      could understand, though they did not join much in it, except that now and
      then Dr. May turned to Ethel as a reference for names and dates. To make
      up for silence at dinner, there was a most confidential chatter in the
      drawing-room. Flora and Meta on one side, hand in hand, calling each other
      by their Christian names, Mrs. Larpent and Ethel on the other. Flora
      dreaded only that Ethel was talking too much, and revealing too much in
      how different style they lived. Then came the gentlemen, Dr. May begging
      Mr. Rivers to show Ethel one of his prints, when Ethel stooped more than
      ever, as if her eyelashes were feelers, but she was in transports of
      delight, and her embarrassment entirely at an end in her admiration, as
      she exclaimed and discussed with her papa, and by her hearty appreciation
      made Mr. Rivers for the time forget her plainness. Music followed; Flora
      played nicely, Meta like a well-taught girl; Ethel went on musing over the
      engravings. The carriage was announced, and so ended the day in Norman&rsquo;s
      fairy-land. Ethel went home, leaning hard against her papa, talking to him
      of Raphael&rsquo;s Madonnas; and looking out at the stars, and thinking how the
      heavenly beauty of those faces that, in the prints she had been turning
      over, seemed to be connected with the glories of the dark-blue sky and
      glowing stars. &ldquo;As one star differeth from another star in glory,&rdquo;
       murmured she; &ldquo;that was the lesson to-day, papa;&rdquo; and when she felt him
      press her hand, she knew he was thinking of that last time she had heard
      the lesson, when he had not been with her, and her thoughts went with his,
      though not another word was spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora hardly knew when they ceased to talk. She had musings equally
      engrossing of her own. She saw she was likely to be very intimate with
      Meta Rivers, and she was roaming away into schemes for not letting the
      intercourse drop, and hopes of being admitted to many a pleasure as yet
      little within her reach&mdash;parties, balls, London, itself, and, above
      all, the satisfaction of being admired. The certainty that Mr. Rivers
      thought her pretty and agreeable had gratified her all the evening, and if
      he, with his refined taste, thought so, what would others think? Her only
      fear was, that Ethel&rsquo;s awkwardness might make an unfavourable impression,
      but, at least, she said to herself, it was anything but vulgar
      awkwardness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their reflections were interrupted by the fly stopping. It was at a little
      shop in the outskirts of the town, and Dr. May, explained that he wanted
      to inquire for a patient. He went in for a moment, then came back to
      desire that they would go home, for he should be detained some little
      time. No one need sit up for him&mdash;he would let himself in.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed a comment on Ethel&rsquo;s thoughts, bringing them back to the present
      hour. That daily work of homely mercy, hoping for nothing again, was
      surely the true way of doing service.

      CHAPTER XXI.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    WATCHMAN. How, if he will not stand?
    DOGBERRY. Why, then, take no note of him, but let him go.
                                          Much Ado about Nothing.
</pre>
    <p>
      Dr. May promised Margaret that he would see whether the black-hole of
      Cocksmoor was all that Norman depicted it, and, accordingly, he came home
      that way on Tuesday evening the next week, much to the astonishment of
      Richard, who was in the act of so mending the window that it might let in
      air when open, and keep it out when shut, neither of which purposes had it
      ever yet answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. May walked in, met his daughter&rsquo;s look of delight and surprise, spoke
      cheerfully to Mrs. Green, a hospital acquaintance of his, like half the
      rest of the country, and made her smile and curtsey by asking if she was
      not surprised at such doings in her house; then looked at the children,
      and patted the head that looked most fit to pat, inquired who was the best
      scholar, and offered a penny to whoever could spell copper tea-kettle,
      which being done by three merry mortals, and having made him extremely
      popular, he offered Ethel a lift, and carried her off between him and
      Adams, on whom he now depended for driving him, since Richard was going to
      Oxford at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was possible to spare him now. Dr. May&rsquo;s arm was as well as he expected
      it ever would be; he had discarded the sling, and could use his hand
      again, but the arm was still stiff and weak&mdash;he could not stretch it
      out, nor use it for anything requiring strength; it soon grew tired with
      writing, and his daughters feared that it ached more than he chose to
      confess, when they saw it resting in the breast of his waistcoat. Driving
      he never would have attempted again, even if he could, and he had quite
      given up carving&mdash;he could better bear to sit at the side than at the
      bottom of the dinner-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Means of carrying Margaret safely had been arranged by Richard, and there
      was no necessity for longer delaying his going to Oxford, but he was so
      unwillingly spared by all, as to put him quite into good spirits. Ethel
      was much concerned to lose him from Cocksmoor, and dreaded hindrances to
      her going thither without his escort; but she had much trust in having her
      father on her side, and meant to get authority from him for the propriety
      of going alone with Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not know how Norman had jeopardised her projects, but the danger
      blew over. Dr. May told Margaret that the place was clean and wholesome,
      and though more smoky than might be preferred, there was nothing to do any
      one in health any harm, especially when the walk there and back was over
      the fresh moor. He lectured Ethel herself on opening the window, now that
      she could; and advised Norman to go and spend an hour in the school, that
      he might learn how pleasant peat-smoke was&mdash;a speech Norman did not
      like at all. The real touchstone of temper is ridicule on a point where we
      do not choose to own ourselves fastidious, and if it and been from any one
      but his father, Norman would not have so entirely kept down his
      irritation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard passed his examination successfully, and Dr. May wrote himself to
      express his satisfaction. Nothing went wrong just now except little Tom,
      who seemed to be justifying Richard&rsquo;s fears of the consequence of exciting
      his father&rsquo;s anger. At home, he shrank and hesitated at the simplest
      question if put by his father suddenly; and the appearance of cowardice
      and prevarication displeasing Dr. May further, rendered his tone louder,
      and frightened Tom the more, giving his manner an air of sullen reserve
      that was most unpleasant. At school it was much the same&mdash;he kept
      aloof from Norman, and threw himself more into the opposite faction, by
      whom he was shielded from all punishment, except what they chose
      themselves to inflict on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norman&rsquo;s post as head of the school was rendered more difficult by the
      departure of his friend Cheviot, who had always upheld his authority;
      Harvey Anderson did not openly transgress, for he had a character to
      maintain, but it was well known throughout the school that there was a
      wide difference between the boys, and that Anderson thought it absurd,
      superfluous, and troublesome in May not to wink at abuses which appeared
      to be licensed by long standing. When Edward Anderson, Axworthy, and their
      set, broke through rules, it was with the understanding that the second
      boy in the school would support them, if he durst.
    </p>
    <p>
      The summer and the cricket season brought the battle of Ballhatchet&rsquo;s
      house to issue. The cricket ground was the field close to it, and for the
      last two or three years there had been a frequent custom of despatching
      juniors to his house for tarts and ginger-beer bottles. Norman knew of
      instances last year in which this had led to serious mischief, and had
      made up his mind that, at whatever loss of popularity, it was his duty to
      put a stop to the practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was an ardent cricketer himself, and though the game did not, in
      anticipation, seem to him to have all the charms of last year, he entered
      into it with full zest when once engaged. But his eye was on all parts of
      the field, and especially on the corner by the bridge, and the boys knew
      him well enough to attempt nothing unlawful within the range of that
      glance. However, the constant vigilance was a strain too great to be
      always kept up, and he had reason to believe he was eluded more than once.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last came a capture, something like that of Tom, one which he could not
      have well avoided making. The victim was George Larkins, the son of a
      clergyman in the neighbourhood, a wild, merry varlet, who got into
      mischief rather for the sake of the fun than from any bad disposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      His look of consternation was exaggerated into a most comical caricature,
      in order to hide how much of it was real.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you are at that trick, Larkins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There! that bet is lost!&rdquo; exclaimed Larkins. &ldquo;I laid Hill half-a-crown
      that you would not see me when you were mooning over your verses!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I have seen you. And now&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, you would not thrash a fellow when you have just lost him
      half-a-crown! Single misfortunes never come alone, they say; so there&rsquo;s my
      money and my credit gone, to say nothing of Ballhatchet&rsquo;s ginger-beer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy made such absurd faces, that Norman could hardly help laughing,
      though he wished to make it a serious affair. &ldquo;You know, Larkins, I have
      given out that such things are not to be. It is a melancholy fact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, so you must make an example of me!&rdquo; said Larkins, pretending to look
      resigned. &ldquo;Better call all the fellows together, hadn&rsquo;t you, and make it
      more effective? It would be grateful to one&rsquo;s feelings, you know; and
      June,&rdquo; added he, with a ridiculous confidential air, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;ll only lay
      it on soft, I&rsquo;ll take care it makes noise enough. Great cry, little wool,
      you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come with me,&rdquo; said Norman. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take care you are example enough. What
      did you give for those articles?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fifteen-pence halfpenny. Rascally dear, isn&rsquo;t it? but the old rogue makes
      one pay double for the risk! You are making his fortune, you have raised
      his prices fourfold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take care of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, where are you taking me? Back to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to gratify your wish to be an example.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A gibbet! a gibbet&rdquo; cried Larkins. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m to be turned off on the spot
      where the crime took place&mdash;a warning to all beholders. Only let me
      send home for old Neptune&rsquo;s chain, if you please, sir&mdash;if you hang me
      in the combined watch-chains of the school, I fear they would give way and
      defeat the purposes of justice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were by this time at the bridge. &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; said Norman to his
      follower, as he crossed the entrance of the little shop, the first time he
      had ever been there. A little cringing shrivelled old man stood up in
      astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. May! can I have the pleasure, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Ballhatchet, you know that it is contrary to the rules that there
      should be any traffic with the school without special permission?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir&mdash;just nothing, sir&mdash;only when the young gentlemen come
      here, sir&mdash;I&rsquo;m an old man, sir, and I don&rsquo;t like not to oblige a
      young gentleman, sir,&rdquo; pleaded the old man, in a great fright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo; said Norman, &ldquo;but I am come to give you fair notice. I am
      not going to allow the boys here to be continually smuggling spirits into
      the school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spirits! bless you, sir, I never thought of no sich a thing! &lsquo;Tis nothing
      in life but ginger-beer&mdash;very cooling drink, sir, of my wife&rsquo;s making;
      she had the receipt from her grandmother up in Leicestershire. Won&rsquo;t you
      taste a bottle, sir?&rdquo; and he hastily made a cork bounce, and poured it
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      That, of course, was genuine, but Norman was &ldquo;up to him,&rdquo; in schoolboy
      phrase.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me yours, Larkins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No pop ensued. Larkins, enjoying the detection, put his hands on his knees
      and looked wickedly up in the old man&rsquo;s face to see what was coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless me! it is a little flat. I wonder how that happened? I&rsquo;ll be most
      happy to change it, sir. Wife! what&rsquo;s the meaning of Mr. Larkins&rsquo;s
      ginger-pop being so flat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very curious ginger-beer indeed, Mr. Ballhatchet,&rdquo; said Norman;
      &ldquo;and since it is liable to have such strange properties, I cannot allow it
      to be used any more at the school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, sir-as you please, sir. You are the first gentleman as has
      objected, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, once for all, I give you warning,&rdquo; added Norman, &ldquo;that if I have
      reason to believe you have been obliging the young gentlemen, the
      magistrates and the trustees of the road shall certainly hear of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would not hurt a poor man, sir, as is drove to it&mdash;you as has
      such a name for goodness!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have given you warning,&rdquo; said Norman. &ldquo;The next time I find any of your
      bottles in the school fields, your licence goes. Now, there are your
      goods. Give Mr. Larkins back the fifteen-pence. I wonder you are not
      ashamed of such a charge!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having extracted the money, Norman turned to leave the shop. Larkins,
      triumphant, &ldquo;Ha! there&rsquo;s Harrison!&rdquo; as the tutor rode by, and they touched
      their caps. &ldquo;How he stared! My eyes! June, you&rsquo;ll be had up for dealing
      with old Ball!&rdquo; and he went into an ecstasy of laughing. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve settled
      him, I believe. Well, is justice satisfied?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be no use thrashing you,&rdquo; said Norman, laughing, as he leaned
      against the parapet of the bridge, and pinched the boy&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
      nothing to be got out of you but chaff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Larkins was charmed with the compliment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll tell you what, Larkins, I can&rsquo;t think how a fellow like you can
      go and give in to these sneaking, underhand tricks that make you ashamed
      to look one in the face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is only for the fun of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I wish you would find your fun some other way. Come, Larkins,
      recollect yourself a little&mdash;you have a home not so far off. How do
      you think your father and mother would fancy seeing you reading the book
      you had yesterday, or coming out of Ballhatchet&rsquo;s with a bottle of
      spirits, called by a false name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Larkins pinched his fingers; home was a string that could touch him, but
      it seemed beneath him to own it. At that moment a carriage approached, the
      boy&rsquo;s whole face lighted up, and he jumped forward. &ldquo;Our own!&rdquo; he cried.
      &ldquo;There she is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was, of course, his mother; and Norman, though turning hastily away
      that his presence might prove no restraint, saw the boy fly over the door
      of the open carriage, and could have sobbed at the thought of what that
      meeting was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was that with you?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Larkins, when she had obtained leave
      to have her boy with her, while she did her shopping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was May senior, our dux.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it? I am very glad you should be with him, my dear George. He is very
      kind to you, I hope?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a jolly good fellow,&rdquo; said Larkins sincerely, though by no means
      troubling himself as to the appropriateness of the eulogy, nor thinking it
      necessary to explain to his mother the terms of the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not fruitless; Larkins did avoid mischief when it was not extremely
      inviting, was more amenable to May senior, and having been put in mind by
      him of his home, was not ashamed to bring the thought to the aid of his
      eyes, when, on Sunday, during a long sermon of Mr. Ramsden&rsquo;s, he knew that
      Axworthy was making the grimace which irresistibly incited him to make a
      still finer one.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Ballhatchet was so much convinced of &ldquo;that there young May&rdquo; being in
      earnest, that he assured his persuasive customers that it was as much as
      his licence was worth to supply them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evil and insubordination were more easily kept under than Norman had
      expected, when he first made up his mind to the struggle. Firmness had so
      far carried the day, and the power of manful assertion of the right had
      been proved, contrary to Cheviot&rsquo;s parting auguries, that he would only
      make himself disliked, and do no good.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole of the school was extremely excited this summer by a proceeding
      of Mr. Tomkins, the brewer, who suddenly closed up the footway called
      Randall&rsquo;s Alley, declaring that there was no right of passage through a
      certain field at the back of his brewery. Not only the school, but the
      town was indignant, and the Mays especially so. It had been the doctor&rsquo;s
      way to school forty years ago, and there were recollections connected with
      it that made him regard it with personal affection. Norman, too, could not
      bear to lose it; he had not entirely conquered his reluctance to pass that
      spot in the High Street, and the loss of the alley would be a positive
      deprivation to him. Almost every native of Stoneborough felt strongly the
      encroachment of the brewer, and the boys, of course, carried the sentiment
      to exaggeration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The propensity to public speaking perhaps added to the excitement, for
      Norman May and Harvey Anderson, for once in unison, each made a vehement
      harangue in the school-court&mdash;Anderson&rsquo;s a fine specimen of the
      village Hampden style, about Britons never suffering indignities, and
      free-born Englishmen swelling at injuries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That they do, my hearty,&rdquo; interjected Larkins, pointing to an inflamed
      eye that had not returned to its right dimensions. However, Anderson went
      on unmoved by the under titter, and demonstrated, to the full satisfaction
      of all the audience, that nothing could be more illegal and unfounded than
      the brewer&rsquo;s claims.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came a great outburst from Norman, with all his father&rsquo;s headlong
      vehemence; the way was the right of the town, the walk had been trodden by
      their forefathers for generations past&mdash;it had been made by the good
      old generous-hearted man who loved his town and townspeople, and would
      have heard with shame and anger of a stranger, a new inhabitant, a
      grasping radical, caring, as radicals always did, for no rights, but for
      their own chance of unjust gains, coming here to Stoneborough to cut them
      off from their own path. He talk of liberalism and the rights of the poor!
      He who cut off Randall&rsquo;s poor old creatures in the almshouses from their
      short way! and then came some stories of his oppression as a poor-law
      guardian, which greatly aggravated the wrath of the speaker and audience,
      though otherwise they did not exactly bear on the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would old Nicholas Randall say to these nineteenth-century doings?&rdquo;
       finished Norman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down, with them!&rdquo; cried a voice from the throng, probably Larkins&rsquo;s; but
      there was no desire to investigate, it was the universal sentiment. &ldquo;Down
      with it! Hurrah, we&rsquo;ll have our footpath open again! Down with the fences!
      Britons never shall be slaves!&rdquo; as Larkins finally ejaculated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way to bring it to bear!&rdquo; said Harvey Anderson, &ldquo;See if he
      dares to bring an action against us. Hurrah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s the way to settle it,&rdquo; said Norman. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have it down. It
      is an oppressive, arbitrary, shameful proceeding, and we&rsquo;ll show him we
      won&rsquo;t submit to it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carried along by the general feeling, the whole troop of boys dashed
      shouting up to the barricade at the entrance of the field, and levelled it
      with the ground. A handkerchief was fastened to the top of one of the
      stakes, and waved over the brewhouse wall, and some of the boys were for
      picking up stones and dirt, and launching them over, in hopes of spoiling
      the beer; but Norman put a stop to this, and brought them back to the
      school-yard, still in a noisy state of exultation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It cooled a little by-and-by under the doubt how their exploit would be
      taken. At home, Norman found it already known, and his father half glad,
      half vexed, enjoying the victory over Tomkins, yet a little uneasy on his
      son&rsquo;s behalf. &ldquo;What will Dr. Hoxton say to the dux?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
      know he was to be dux in mischief as well as out of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t call it mischief, papa, to resent an unwarranted encroachment
      of our rights by such an old ruffian as that. One&rsquo;s blood is up to think
      of the things he has done!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He richly deserves it, no doubt,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;and yet I wish you
      had been out of the row. If there is any blame, you will be the first it
      will light on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad of it, that is but just. Anderson and I seem to have stirred it
      up&mdash;if it wanted stirring&mdash;for it was in every fellow there;
      indeed, I had no notion it was coming to this when I began.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oratory,&rdquo; said the doctor, smiling. &ldquo;Ha, Norman! Think a little another
      time, my boy, before you take the law into your own hands, or, what is
      worse, into a lot of hands you can&rsquo;t control for good, though you may
      excite them to harm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Hoxton did not come into school at the usual hour, and, in the course
      of the morning, sent for May senior, to speak to him in his study.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked very broad, awful, and dignified, as he informed him that Mr.
      Tomkins had just been with him to complain of the damage that had been
      done, and he appeared extremely displeased that the dux should have been
      no check on such proceedings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry, sir,&rdquo; said Norman, &ldquo;but I believe it was the general feeling
      that he had no right to stop the alley, and, therefore, that it could not
      be wrong to break it down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whether he has a right or not is not a question to be settled by you. So
      I find that you, whose proper office it is to keep order, have been
      inflaming the mischievous and aggressive spirit amongst the others. I am
      surprised at you; I thought you were more to be depended upon, May, in
      your position.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norman coloured a good deal, and simply answered, &ldquo;I am sorry, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care, then, that nothing of the kind happens again,&rdquo; said Dr.
      Hoxton, who was very fond of him, and did not find fault with him
      willingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      That the first inflammatory discourse had been made by Anderson did not
      appear to be known&mdash;he only came in for the general reprimand given
      to the school.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was reported the following evening, just as the town boys turned out to
      go to their homes, that &ldquo;old Tomkins had his fence up five times higher
      than before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have at him again, say I!&rdquo; exclaimed Axworthy. &ldquo;What business has he
      coming stopping up ways that were made before he was born?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall catch it from the doctor if we do,&rdquo; said Edward Anderson, &ldquo;He
      looked in no end of a rage yesterday when he talked about the credit of
      the school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who cares for the credit of the school?&rdquo; said the elder Anderson; &ldquo;we are
      out of the school now&mdash;we are townsmen&mdash;Stoneborough boys&mdash;citizens
      not bound to submit to injustice. No, no, the old rogue knew it would not
      stand if it was brought into court, so he brings down old Hoxton on us
      instead&mdash;a dirty trick he deserves to be punished for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And there was a general shout and yell in reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anderson,&rdquo; said Norman, &ldquo;you had better not excite them again, they are
      ripe for mischief. It will go further than it did yesterday&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      you see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anderson could not afford to get into a scrape without May to stand before
      him, and rather sulkily he assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is of no use to rave about old Tomkins,&rdquo; proceeded Norman, in his
      style of popular oratory. &ldquo;If it is illegal, some one will go to law about
      it, and we shall have our alley again. We have shown him our mind once,
      and that is enough; if we let him alone now, he will see &lsquo;tis only because
      we are ordered, not for his sake. It would be just putting him in the
      right, and maybe winning his cause for him, to use any more violence.
      There&rsquo;s law for you, Anderson. So now no more about it&mdash;let us all go
      home like rational fellows. August, where&rsquo;s August?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom was not visible&mdash;he generally avoided going home with his
      brother; and Norman having seen the boys divide into two or three little
      parties, as their roads lay homewards, found he had an hour of light for
      an expedition of his own, along the bank of the river. He had taken up
      botany with much ardour, and sharing the study with Margaret was a great
      delight to both. There was a report that the rare yellow bog-bean grew in
      a meadow about a mile and a half up the river, and thither he was bound,
      extremely enjoying the summer evening walk, as the fresh dewy coolness
      sunk on all around, and the noises of the town were mellowed by distance,
      and the sun&rsquo;s last beams slanted on the green meadows, and the May-flies
      danced, and dragon-flies darted, and fish rose or leaped high in the air,
      or showed their spotted sides, and opened and shut their gills, as they
      rested in the clear water, and the evening breeze rustled in the tall
      reeds, and brought fragrance from the fresh-mown hay.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was complete enjoyment to Norman after his day&rsquo;s study and the rule and
      watch over the unruly crowd of boys, and he walked and wandered and
      collected plants for Margaret till the sun was down, and the grasshoppers
      chirped clamorously, while the fern-owl purred, and the beetle hummed, and
      the skimming swallows had given place to the soft-winged bat, and the
      large white owl floating over the fields as it moused in the long grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      The summer twilight was sobering every tint, when, as Norman crossed the
      cricket-field, he heard, in the distance, a loud shout. He looked up, and
      it seemed to him that he saw some black specks dancing in the forbidden
      field, and something like the waving of a flag, but it was not light
      enough to be certain, and he walked quickly home.
    </p>
    <p>
      The front door was fastened, and, while he was waiting to be let in, Mr.
      Harrison walked by, and called out, &ldquo;You are late at home to-night&mdash;it
      is half-past nine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been taking a walk, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A good-night was the answer, as he was admitted. Every one in the
      drawing-room looked up, and exclaimed as he entered, &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Tom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! he is not come home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! Was he not with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I missed him after school. I was persuaded he was come home. I have been
      to look for the yellow bog-bean. There, Margaret. Had not I better go and
      look for him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, do,&rdquo; said Dr. May. &ldquo;The boy is never off one&rsquo;s mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sort of instinctive dread directed Norman&rsquo;s steps down the open portion
      of Randall&rsquo;s Alley, and, voices growing louder as he came nearer,
      confirmed his suspicions. The fence at this end was down, and, on entering
      the field, a gleam of light met his eye on the ground&mdash;a cloud of
      smoke, black figures were flitting round it, pushing brands into red
      places, and feeding the bonfire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you been doing?&rdquo; exclaimed Norman. &ldquo;You have got yourselves
      into a tremendous scrape!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A peal of laughter, and shout of &ldquo;Randall and Stoneborough for ever!&rdquo; was
      the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;August! May junior! Tom! answer me! Is he here?&rdquo; asked Norman, not
      solicitous to identify any one.
    </p>
    <p>
      But gruff voices broke in upon them. &ldquo;There they are, nothing like &lsquo;em for
      mischief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, young gentlemen,&rdquo; said a policeman, &ldquo;be off, if you please. We
      don&rsquo;t want to have none of you at the station to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A general hurry-skurry ensued. Norman alone, strong in innocence, walked
      quietly away, and, as he came forth from the darkness of the alley, beheld
      something scouring away before him, in the direction of home. It popped in
      at the front door before him, but was not in the drawing-room. He strode
      upstairs, called, but was not answered, and found, under the bedclothes, a
      quivering mass, consisting of Tom, with all his clothes on, fully
      persuaded that it was the policeman who was pursuing him.

      CHAPTER XXII.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">

     Oh Life, without thy chequered scene,
     Of right and wrong, of weal and woe,
     Success and failure, could a ground
     For magnanimity be found?
                                   WORDSWORTH.
</pre>
    <p>
      Dr. May was called for late the next day, Friday, and spent some time in
      one of the houses near the river. It was nearly eight o&rsquo;clock when he came
      away, and he lingered, looking towards the school, in hopes of a walk home
      with his boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he saw Norman coming out from under the archway, his cap drawn
      over his face, and step, gesture, and manner betraying that something was
      seriously wrong. He came up almost to his father without seeing him, until
      startled by his exclamation, &ldquo;Norman&mdash;why, Norman, what&rsquo;s the
      matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norman&rsquo;s lips quivered, and his face was pale&mdash;he seemed as if he
      could not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Tom?&rdquo; said the doctor, much alarmed. &ldquo;Has he got into disgrace
      about this business of Tomkins? That boy&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has only got an imposition,&rdquo; interrupted Norman. &ldquo;No, it is not that&mdash;it
      is myself&rdquo;&mdash;and it was only with a gulp and struggle that he brought
      out the words, &ldquo;I am turned down in the school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor started back a step or two, aghast. &ldquo;What-how&mdash;speak,
      Norman. What have you done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing!&rdquo; said Norman, recovering in the desire to reassure his father&mdash;&ldquo;nothing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said the doctor, breathing freely. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the meaning of
      it...a misunderstanding?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Norman, with bitterness. &ldquo;It is all Anderson&rsquo;s doing&mdash;a
      word from him would have set all straight&mdash;but he would not; I
      believe, from my heart, he held his tongue to get me down, that he might
      have the Randall!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see you righted,&rdquo; said the doctor eagerly. &ldquo;Come, tell me the whole
      story, Norman. Is it about this unlucky business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. The town-fellows were all up about it last evening, when we came out
      of school. Anderson senior himself began to put them up to having the
      fence down again. Yes, that he did&mdash;I remember his very words&mdash;that
      Tomkins could not bring it into court, and so set old Hoxton at us. Well,
      I told them it would not do&mdash;thought I had settled them&mdash;saw
      them off home&mdash;yes, Simpson, and Benson, and Grey, up the High
      Street, and the others their way. I only left Axworthy going into a shop
      when I set off on my walk. What could a fellow do more? How was I to know
      that that Axworthy would get them together again, and take them to this
      affair&mdash;pull up the stakes&mdash;saw them down&mdash;for they were
      hard to get down&mdash;shy all sorts of things over into the court&mdash;hoot at
      old Tomkins&rsquo;s man, when he told them to be off&mdash;and make a bonfire of
      the sticks at last?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Harvey Anderson was there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;not he. He is too sharp&mdash;born and bred attorney as he is&mdash;he
      talked them up to the mischief when my back was turned, and then sneaked
      quietly home, quite innocent, and out of the scrape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Dr. Hoxton can never entertain a suspicion that you had anything to
      do with it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he does though. He thinks I incited them, and Tomkins and the
      policeman declare I was there in the midst of the row&mdash;and not one of
      these fellows will explain how I came at the last to look for Tom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not Tom himself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did try to speak, poor little fellow, but, after the other affair, his
      word goes for nothing, and so, it seems, does mine. I did think Hoxton
      would have trusted me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And did not he?&rdquo; exclaimed Dr. May.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did not in so many words accuse me of&mdash;of&mdash;but he told me he
      had serious charges brought against me&mdash;Mr. Harrison had seen me at
      Ballhatchet&rsquo;s, setting an example of disregard to rules&mdash;and, again,
      Mr. Harrison saw me coming in at a late hour last night. &lsquo;I know he did,&rsquo;
      I said, and I explained where I had been, and they asked for proofs! I
      could hardly answer, from surprise, at their not seeming to believe me,
      but I said you could answer for my having come in with the flowers for my
      sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure I will&mdash;I&rsquo;ll go this instant&mdash;&rdquo; he was turning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is of no use, papa, to-night; Dr. Hoxton has a dinner-party.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is always having parties. I wish he would mind them less, and his
      business more. You disbelieved! but I&rsquo;ll see justice done you, Norman, the
      first thing to-morrow. Well&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then, I said, old Ballhatchet could tell that I crossed the bridge
      at the very time they were doing this pretty piece of work, for he was
      sitting smoking in his porch when I went home, and, would you believe it?
      the old rascal would not remember who passed that evening! It is all his
      malice and revenge&mdash;nothing else!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;what have you been doing to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norman shortly explained the ginger-beer story, and adding, &ldquo;Cheviot told
      me I should get nothing but ill-will, and so I have&mdash;all those town
      fellows turn against me now, and though they know as well as possible how
      it was, they won&rsquo;t say a word to right me, just out of spite, because I
      have stopped them from all the mischief I could!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They asked me whether&mdash;since I allowed that I had been there at last&mdash;I
      had dispersed the boys. I said no, I had no time. Then they desired to
      know who was there, and that I had not seen; it was all dark, and there
      had not been a moment, and if I guessed, it was no affair of mine to say.
      So they ordered me down, and had up Ned Anderson, and one or two more who
      were known to have been in the riot, and then they consulted a good while,
      and sent for me; Mr. Wilmot was for me, I am sure, but Harrison was
      against me. Dr. Hoxton sat there, and made me one of his addresses. He
      said he would not enter on the question whether I had been present at the
      repetition of the outrage, as he called it, but what was quite certain
      was, that I had abused my authority and influence in the school; I had
      been setting a bad example, and breaking the rules about Ballhatchet, and
      so far from repressing mischief, I had been the foremost in it, making
      inflammatory harangues, leading them to commit violence the first time,
      and the next, if not actually taking part in it personally, at any rate
      not preventing it. In short, he said it was clear I had not weight enough
      for my post&mdash;it was some excuse I had been raised to it so young&mdash;but
      it was necessary to show that proficiency in studies did not compensate
      for disregard of discipline, and so he turned me down below the first six!
      So there&rsquo;s another May in disgrace!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It shall not last&mdash;it shall not last, my boy,&rdquo; said Dr. May,
      pressing Norman&rsquo;s arm; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you righted. Dr. Hoxton shall hear the
      whole story. I am not for fathers interfering in general, but if ever
      there was a case, this is! Why, it is almost actionable&mdash;injuring
      your whole prospects in life, and all because he will not take the trouble
      to make an investigation! It is a crying shame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every fellow in the school knows how it was,&rdquo; said Norman; &ldquo;and plenty of
      them would be glad to tell, if they had only the opportunity; but he asked
      no one but those two or three worst fellows that were at the fire, and
      they would not tell, on purpose. The school will go to destruction now&mdash;they&rsquo;ll
      get their way, and all I have been striving for is utterly undone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You setting a bad example! Dr. Hoxton little knows what you have been
      doing. It is a mockery, as I have always said, to see that old fellow sit
      wrapped up in his pomposity, eating his good dinners, and knowing no more
      what goes on among his boys than this umbrella! But he will listen to me&mdash;and
      we&rsquo;ll make those boys confess the whole&mdash;ay, and have up Ballhatchet
      himself, to say what your traffic with him was; and we will see what old
      Hoxton says to you then, Norman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. May and his son felt keenly and spoke strongly. There was so much of
      sympathy and fellow-feeling between them, that there was no backwardness
      on Norman&rsquo;s part in telling his whole trouble, with more confidence than
      schoolboys often show towards their fathers, and Dr. May entered into the
      mortification as if he were still at school. They did not go into the
      house, but walked long up and down the garden, working themselves up into,
      if possible, stronger indignation, and concerting the explanation for
      to-morrow, when Dr. May meant to go at once to the head-master, and make
      him attend to the true version of the story, appealing to Harvey Anderson
      himself, Larkins, and many others, for witnesses. There could be hardly a
      doubt that Norman would be thus exculpated; but, if Dr. Hoxton would not
      see things in their true light, Dr. May was ready to take him away at
      once, rather than see him suffer injustice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, though comforted by his father&rsquo;s entire reliance, Norman was
      suffering severely under the sense of indignity, and grieved that Dr.
      Hoxton and the other masters should have believed him guilty&mdash;that
      name of May could never again boast of being without reproach. To be in
      disgrace stung him to the quick, even though undeservedly, and he could
      not bear to go in, meet his sisters, and be pitied. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need they
      should know of it,&rdquo; said he, when the Minster clock pealing ten obliged
      them to go indoors, and his father agreed. They bade each other
      good-night, with the renewal of the promise that Dr. Hoxton should be
      forced to hear Norman&rsquo;s vindication the first thing to-morrow, Harvey
      Anderson be disappointed of what he meanly triumphed in, and Norman be
      again in his post at the head of the school, in more honour and confidence
      than ever, putting down evil, and making Stoneborough what it ought to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Dr. May lay awake in the summer&rsquo;s morning, meditating on his address to
      Dr. Hoxton, he heard the unwelcome sound of a ring at the bell, and, in a
      few minutes, a note was brought to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell Adams to get the gig ready&mdash;I&rsquo;ll let him know whether he is to
      go with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, in a few minutes, the doctor opened Norman&rsquo;s door, and found him
      dressed, and standing by the window, reading. &ldquo;What, up already, Norman? I
      came to tell you that our affairs must wait till the afternoon. It is very
      provoking, for Hoxton may be gone out, but Mr. Lake&rsquo;s son, at Groveswood,
      has an attack on the head, and I must go at once. It is a couple of dozen
      miles off or more. I have hardly ever been there, and it may keep me all
      day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall you go in the gig? Shall I drive you?&rdquo; said Norman, looking rather
      blank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I thought of, if you like it. I thought you would sooner be
      out of the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you&mdash;yes, papa. Shall I come and help you to finish dressing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, do, thank you; it will hasten matters. Only, first order in some
      breakfast. What makes you up so early? Have not you slept?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much&mdash;it has been such a hot night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have a headache. Well, we will find a cure for that before the
      day is over. I have settled what to say to old Hoxton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before another quarter of an hour had passed, they were driving through
      the deep lanes, the long grass thickly laden with morning dew, which
      beaded the webs of the spiders and rose in clouds of mist under the
      influence of the sun&rsquo;s rays. There was stillness in the air at first, then
      the morning sounds, the labourer going forth, the world wakening to life,
      the opening houses, the children coming out to school. In spite of the
      tumult of feeling, Norman could not but be soothed and refreshed by the
      new and fair morning scene, and both minds quitted the school politics, as
      Dr. May talked of past enjoyment of walks or drives home in early dawn,
      the more delicious after a sad watch in a sick-room, and told of the fair
      sights he had seen at such unwonted hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had far to go, and the heat of the day had come on before they
      entered the place of their destination. It was a woodland village, built
      on a nook in the side of the hill, sloping greenly to the river, and shut
      in by a white gate, which seemed to gather all in one the little
      old-fashioned church, its yard, shaded with trees, and enclosed by long
      white rails; the parsonage, covered with climbing plants and in the midst
      of a gay garden; and one or two cottages. The woods cast a cool shadow,
      and, in the meadows by the river rose cocks of new-made hay; there was an
      air of abiding serenity about the whole place, save that there stood an
      old man by the gate, evidently watching for the physician&rsquo;s carriage; and
      where the sun fell on that parsonage-house was a bedroom window wide open,
      with the curtains drawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank Heaven you are come, sir,&rdquo; said the old man; &ldquo;he is fearfully bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norman knew young Lake, who had been a senior boy when he first went to
      school, was a Randall scholar, and had borne an excellent character, and
      highly distinguished himself at the university. And now, by all accounts,
      he seemed to be dying&mdash;in the height of honour and general esteem.
      Dr. May went into the house, the old man took the horse, and Norman
      lingered under the trees in the churchyard, watching the white curtains
      now and then puffed by the fitful summer breeze, as he lay on the turf in
      the shade, under the influence of the gentle sadness around, resting, mind
      and body, from the tossing tumultuous passionate sensations that had kept
      him restless and miserable through the hot night.
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited long&mdash;one hour, two hours had passed away, but he was not
      impatient, and hardly knew how long the time had been before his father
      and Mr. Lake came out of the house together, and, after they parted, Dr.
      May summoned him. He of course asked first for the patient. &ldquo;Not quite so
      hopeless as at first,&rdquo; and the reasons for having been kept so long were
      detailed, with many circumstances of the youth&rsquo;s illness, and the parents&rsquo;
      resignation, by which Dr. May was still too deeply touched to have room in
      his mind for anything besides.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were more than half-way home, and a silence had succeeded the
      conversation about the Lake family, when Norman spoke:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa, I have been thinking about it, and I believe it would be better to
      let it alone, if you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not apply to Dr. Hoxton!&rdquo; exclaimed his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I think not. I have been considering it, and it does hardly seem to
      me the right thing. You see, if I had not you close at hand, this could
      never be explained, and it seems rather hard upon Anderson, who has no
      father, and the other fellows, who have theirs farther off&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right, Norman, that is what my father before me always said, and the way
      I have always acted myself; much better let a few trifles go on not just
      as one would wish, than be for ever interfering. But I really think this
      is a case for it, and I don&rsquo;t think you ought to let yourself be
      influenced by the fear of any party-spirit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not only that, papa&mdash;I have been thinking a good deal to-day,
      and there are other reasons. Of course I should wish Dr. Hoxton to know
      that I spoke the truth about that walk, and I hope you will let him know,
      as I appealed to you. But, on cooler thoughts, I don&rsquo;t believe Dr. Hoxton
      could seriously suspect me of such a thing as that, and it was not on that
      ground that I am turned down, but that I did not keep up sufficient
      discipline, and allowed the outrage, as he calls it. Now, you know, that
      is, after a fashion, true. If I had not gone on like an ass the other day,
      and incited them to pull down the fences, they would not have done it
      afterwards, and perhaps I ought to have kept on guard longer. It was my
      fault, and we can&rsquo;t deny it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. May made a restless, reluctant movement. &ldquo;Well, well, I suppose it was&mdash;but
      it was just as much Harvey Anderson&rsquo;s&mdash;and is he to get the
      scholarship because he has added meanness to the rest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was not dux,&rdquo; said Norman, with a sigh. &ldquo;It was more shabby than I
      thought was even in him. But I don&rsquo;t know that the feeling about him is
      not one reason. There has always been a rivalry and bitterness between us
      two, and if I were to get the upper hand now, by means not in the usual
      course, such as the fellows would think ill of, it would be worse than
      ever, and I should always feel guilty and ashamed to look at him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over-refining, Norman,&rdquo; muttered Dr. May.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides, don&rsquo;t you remember, when his father died, how glad you and
      everyone were to get him a nomination, and it was said that if he gained a
      scholarship it would be such a relief to poor Mrs. Anderson? Now he has
      this chance, it does seem hard to deprive her of it. I should not like to
      know that I had done so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; the doctor gave a considering whistle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could not make it straight, papa, without explaining about the
      dealing with Ballhatchet, and that would be unfair to them all, even the
      old rogue himself; for I promised to say nothing about former practices,
      as long as he did not renew them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! I don&rsquo;t want to compromise you, Norman. You know your own ground
      best, but I don&rsquo;t like it at all. You don&rsquo;t know the humiliation of
      disgrace. Those who have thought highly of you, now thinking you changed&mdash;I
      don&rsquo;t know how to bear it for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind anything while you trust me,&rdquo; said Norman, eagerly; &ldquo;not
      much I mean, except Mr. Wilmot. You must judge, papa, and do as you
      please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you must judge, Norman. Your confidence in me ought not to be a
      restraint. It has always been an understood thing that what you say at
      home is as if it had not been said, as regards my dealings with the
      masters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, papa. Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you what brought me to this. I tumbled
      about all night in a rage, when I thought how they had served me, and of
      Hoxton&rsquo;s believing it all, and how he might only half give in to your
      representation, and then I gloried in Anderson&rsquo;s coming down from his
      height, and being seen in his true colours. So it went on till morning
      came, and I got up. You know you gave me my mother&rsquo;s little &lsquo;Thomas a
      Kempis&rsquo;. I always read a bit every morning. To-day it was, &lsquo;Of four things
      that bring much inward peace&rsquo;. And what do you think they were?&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;&lsquo;Be desirous, my son, to do the will of another
        rather than thine own.
     Choose always to have less rather than more.
     Seek always the lowest place, and to be inferior
        to everyone.
     Wish always and pray that the will of God may be
        wholly fulfilled in thee.&rsquo;
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I liked them the more, because it was just like her last reading with us,
      and like that letter. Well, then I wondered as I lay on the grass at
      Groveswood, whether she would have thought it best for me to be
      reinstated, and I found out that I should have been rather afraid of what
      you might say when she had talked it over with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. May smiled a little at the simplicity with which this last was said,
      but his smile ended in one of his heavy sighs. &ldquo;So you took her for your
      counsellor, my boy. That was the way to find out what was right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there was something in the place and, in watching poor Lake&rsquo;s
      windows, that made me not able to dwell so much on getting on, and having
      prizes and scholarships. I thought that caring for those had been driven
      out of me, and you know I never felt as if it were my right when I was
      made dux; but now I find it is all come back. It does not do for me to be
      first; I have been what she called elated, and been more peremptory than
      need with the lower boys, and gone on in my old way with Richard, and so I
      suppose this disgrace has come to punish me. I wish it were not disgrace,
      because of our name at school, and because it will vex Harry so much; but
      since it is come, considering all things, I suppose I ought not to
      struggle to justify myself at other people&rsquo;s expense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His eyes were so dazzled with tears that he could hardly see to drive, nor
      did his father speak at first. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say anything against it, Norman,
      but I am sorry, and one thing more you should consider. If Dr. Hoxton
      should view this absurd business in the way he seems to do, it will stand
      in your way for ever in testimonials, if you try for anything else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think it will interfere with my having a Confirmation ticket?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why no, I should not think&mdash;such a boyish escapade could be no
      reason for refusing you one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well then, it had better rest. If there should be any difficulty
      about my being confirmed, of course we will explain it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish every one showed themselves as well prepared!&rdquo; half muttered the
      doctor; then, after long musing, &ldquo;Well, Norman, I give up the scholarship.
      Poor Mrs. Anderson wants it more than we do, and if the boy is a shabby
      fellow the more he wants a decent education. But what do you say to this?
      I make Hoxton do you full justice, and reinstate you in your proper place,
      and then I take you away at once&mdash;send you to a tutor&mdash;anything,
      till the end of the long vacation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Norman, pausing. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, papa. I am very much
      obliged to you, but I think it would hardly do. You would be uncomfortable
      at seeming to quarrel with Dr. Hoxton, and it would be hardly creditable
      for me to go off in anger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, I believe,&rdquo; said Dr. May. &ldquo;You judge wisely, though I
      should not have ventured to ask it of you. But what is to become of the
      discipline of the school? Is that all to go to the dogs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not do anything with them if I were restored in this way; they
      would be more set against me. It is bad enough as it is, but, even for my
      own peace, I believe it is better to leave it alone. All my comfort in
      school is over, I know!&rdquo; and he sighed deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a most untoward business!&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;I am very sorry your
      schooldays should be clouded&mdash;but it can&rsquo;t be helped, and you will
      work yourself into a character again. You are full young, and can stay for
      the next Randall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norman felt as if, while his father looked at him as he now did, the rest
      of the world were nothing to him; but, perhaps, the driving past the
      school brought him to a different mind, for he walked into the house
      slowly and dejectedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He told his own story to Ethel, in the garden, not without much
      difficulty, so indignant were her exclamations; and it was impossible to
      make her see that his father&rsquo;s interference would put him in an awkward
      position among the boys. She would argue vehemently that she could not
      bear Mr. Wilmot to think ill of him, that it was a great shame of Dr.
      Hoxton, and that it was dreadful to let such a boy as Harvey Anderson go
      unpunished. &ldquo;I really do think it is quite wrong of you to give up your
      chance of doing good, and leave him in his evil ways!&rdquo; That was all the
      comfort she gave Norman, and she walked in to pour out a furious grumbling
      upon Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. May had been telling the elder ones, and they were in conversation
      after he had left them&mdash;Margaret talking with animation, and Flora
      sitting over her drawing, uttering reluctant assents. &ldquo;Has he told you,
      poor fellow?&rdquo; asked Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;Was there ever such a shame?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is just what I say,&rdquo; observed Flora. &ldquo;I cannot see why the Andersons
      are to have a triumph over all of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I used to think Harvey the best of the two,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;Now I think he
      is a great deal the worst. Taking advantage of such a mistake as this! How
      will he ever look Norman in the face!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really,&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;I see no use in aggravating ourselves by talking
      of the Andersons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think how papa can consent,&rdquo; proceeded Flora. &ldquo;I am sure, if I
      were in his place, I should not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa is so much pleased with dear Norman&rsquo;s behaviour that it quite makes
      up for all the disappointment,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;Besides, he is very much
      obliged to him in one way; he would not have liked to have to battle the
      matter with Dr. Hoxton. He spoke of Norman&rsquo;s great good judgment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Norman can persuade papa to anything,&rdquo; said Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I wish papa had not yielded,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;It would have been just
      as noble in dear Norman, and we should not have the apparent disgrace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it is best as it is, after all,&rdquo; said Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, how do you mean?&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think very likely things might have come out. Now don&rsquo;t look furious,
      Ethel. Indeed, I can&rsquo;t help it, but really I don&rsquo;t think it is explicable
      why Norman should wish to hush it up, unless there were something behind!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flora!&rdquo; cried Ethel, too much shocked to bring out another word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are unfortunate enough to have such suspicions,&rdquo; said Margaret
      quietly, &ldquo;I think it would be better to be silent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As if you did not know Norman!&rdquo; stammered Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Flora, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wish to think so. You know I did not hear
      Norman himself, and when papa gives his vehement accounts of things, it
      always puzzles us of the cooler-minded sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is as great a shame as ever I heard!&rdquo; cried Ethel, recovering her
      utterance. &ldquo;Who would you trust, if not your own father and brother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said Flora, not by any means wishing to displease her sisters.
      &ldquo;If there is such a thing as an excess of generosity, it is sure to be
      among ourselves. I only know it does not suit me. It will make us all
      uncomfortable whenever we meet the Andersons or Mr. Wilmot, or any one
      else, and as to such tenderness to Harvey Anderson, I think it is thrown
      away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thrown away on the object, perhaps,&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;but not in Norman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure,&rdquo; broke out Ethel. &ldquo;Better be than seem! Oh, dear! I am sorry
      I was vexed with dear old June when he told me. I had rather have him now
      than if he had gained everything, and every one was praising him&mdash;that
      I had! Harvey Anderson is welcome to be dux and Randall scholar for what I
      care, while Norman is&mdash;while he is, just what we thought of the last
      time we read that Gospel&mdash;you know, Margaret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is&mdash;that he is,&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;and, indeed, it is most
      beautiful to see how what has happened has brought him at once to what she
      wished, when, perhaps, otherwise it would have been a work of long time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel was entirely consoled. Flora thought of the words &ldquo;tete exaltee&rdquo; and
      considered herself alone to have sober sense enough to see things in a
      true light&mdash;not that she went the length of believing that Norman had
      any underhand motives, but she thought it very discreet in her to think a
      prudent father would not have been satisfied with such a desire to avoid
      investigation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. May would not trust himself to enter on the subject with Dr. Hoxton in
      conversation; he only wrote a note.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                                &ldquo;June 16th.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Dr. Hoxton,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My son has appealed to me to confirm his account of himself on Thursday
      evening last. I therefore distinctly state that he came in at half-past
      nine, with his hands full of plants from the river, and that he then went
      out again, by my desire, to look for his little brother.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                              &mdash;Yours very truly,
                                   R. May.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      A long answer came in return, disclaiming all doubt of Norman&rsquo;s veracity,
      and explaining Dr. Hoxton&rsquo;s grounds for having degraded him. There had
      been misconduct in the school, he said, for some time past, and he did not
      consider that it was any very serious reproach, to a boy of Norman&rsquo;s age,
      that he had not had weight enough to keep up his authority, and had been
      carried away by the general feeling. It had been necessary to make an
      example for the sake of principle, and though very sorry it should have
      fallen on one of such high promise and general good conduct, Dr. Hoxton
      trusted that it would not be any permanent injury to his prospects, as his
      talents had raised him to his former position in the school so much
      earlier than usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact was,&rdquo; said Dr. May, &ldquo;that old Hoxton did it in a passion,
      feeling he must punish somebody, and now, finding there&rsquo;s no uproar about
      it, he begins to be sorry. I won&rsquo;t answer this note. I&rsquo;ll stop after
      church to-morrow and shake hands, and that will show we don&rsquo;t bear
      malice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What Mr. Wilmot might think was felt by all to affect them more nearly.
      Ethel wanted to hear that he declared his complete conviction of Norman&rsquo;s
      innocence, and was disappointed to find that he did not once allude to the
      subject. She was only consoled by Margaret&rsquo;s conjecture that, perhaps, he
      thought the headmaster had been hasty, and could not venture to say so&mdash;he
      saw into people&rsquo;s characters, and it was notorious that it was just what
      Dr. Hoxton did not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom had spent the chief of that Saturday in reading a novel borrowed from
      Axworthy, keeping out of sight of every one. All Sunday he avoided Norman
      more scrupulously than ever, and again on Monday. That day was a severe
      trial to Norman; the taking the lower place, and the sense that, excel as
      much as ever he might in his studies, it would not avail to restore him to
      his former place, were more unpleasant, when it came to the point, than he
      had expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw the cold manner, so different from the readiness with which his
      tasks had always been met, certain as they were of being well done; he
      found himself among the common herd whom he had passed so triumphantly,
      and, for a little while, he had no heart to exert himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was conquered by the strong will and self-rebuke for having merely
      craved for applause, but, in the play-ground, he found himself still
      alone&mdash;the other boys who had been raised by his fall shrank from
      intercourse with one whom they had injured by their silence, and the
      Andersons, who were wont to say the Mays carried every tale home, and who
      still almost expected interference from Dr. May, hardly believed their
      victory secure, and the younger one, at least, talked spitefully, and
      triumphed in the result of May&rsquo;s meddling and troublesome over strictness.
      &ldquo;Such prigs always come to a downfall,&rdquo; was the sentiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norman found himself left out of everything, and stood dispirited and
      weary on the bank of the river, wishing for Harry, wishing for Cheviot,
      wishing that he had been able to make a friend who would stand by him,
      thinking it could not be worse if he had let his father reinstate him&mdash;and
      a sensation of loneliness and injustice hung heavy at his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first interruption was a merry voice. &ldquo;I say, June, there&rsquo;s no end of
      river cray-fish under that bank,&rdquo; and Larkins&rsquo;s droll face was looking up
      at him, from that favourite position, half stooping, his hands on his
      knees, his expression of fun trying to conceal his real anxiety and
      sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norman turned and smiled, and looked for the cray-fish, and, at the same
      time, became aware of Hector Ernescliffe, watching for an opportunity to
      say, &ldquo;I have a letter from Alan.&rdquo; He knew they wanted, as far as little
      boys ventured to seek after one so much their elder, to show themselves
      his friends, and he was grateful; he roused himself to hear about Alan&rsquo;s
      news, and found it was important&mdash;his great friend, Captain Gordon,
      had got a ship, and hoped to be able to take him, and this might lead to
      Harry&rsquo;s going with him. Then Norman applied himself to the capture of
      cray-fish, and Larkins grew so full of fun and drollery, that the hours of
      recreation passed off less gloomily than they had begun.
    </p>
    <p>
      If only his own brother would have been his adherent! But he saw almost
      nothing of Tom. Day after day he missed him, he was off before him in
      going and returning from school, and when he caught a sight of his face,
      it looked harassed, pale, and miserable, stealing anxious glances after
      him, yet shrinking from his eye. But, at the same time, Norman did not see
      him mingling with his former friends, and could not make out how he
      disposed of himself. To be thus continually shunned by his own brother,
      even when the general mass were returning to ordinary terms, became so
      painful, that Norman was always on the watch to seek for one more
      conversation with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He caught him at last in the evening, just as they were going home. &ldquo;Tom,
      why are you running away? Come with me,&rdquo; said he authoritatively; and Tom
      obeyed in trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norman led the way to the meads. &ldquo;Tom,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;do not let this go on.
      Why do you serve me in this way? You surely need not turn against me,&rdquo; he
      said, with pleading melancholy in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not needed. Tom had flung himself upon the grass, and was in an
      agony of crying, even before he had finished the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom, Tom! what is the matter? Have they been bullying you again? Look up,
      and tell me&mdash;what is it? You know I can stand by you still, if you&rsquo;ll
      only let me;&rdquo; and Norman sat by him on the grass, and raised his face by a
      sort of force, but the kind words only brought more piteous sobs. It was a
      long time before they diminished enough to let him utter a word, but
      Norman went on patiently consoling and inquiring, sure, at least, that
      here had broken down the sullenness that had always repelled him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last came the words, &ldquo;Oh! I cannot bear it. It is all my doing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&mdash;how&mdash;you don&rsquo;t mean this happening to me? It is not your
      doing, August&mdash;what fancy is this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, it is,&rdquo; said Tom, his voice cut short by gasps, the remains of
      the sobs. &ldquo;They would not hear me! I tried to tell them how you told them
      not, and sent them home. I tried to tell about Ballhatchet&mdash;but&mdash;but
      they wouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;they said if it had been Harry, they would have
      attended&mdash;but they would not believe me. Oh! if Harry was but here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish he was,&rdquo; said Norman, from the bottom of his heart; &ldquo;but you see,
      Tom, if this sets you on always telling truth, I shan&rsquo;t think any great
      harm done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A fresh burst, &ldquo;Oh, they are all so glad! They say such things! And the
      Mays were never in disgrace before. Oh, Norman, Norman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind about that&mdash;&rdquo; began Norman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you would mind,&rdquo; broke in the boy passionately, &ldquo;if you knew what
      Anderson junior and Axworthy say! They say it serves you right, and they
      were going to send me to old Ballhatchet&rsquo;s to get some of his stuff to
      drink confusion to the mouth of June, and all pragmatical meddlers; and
      when I said I could not go, they vowed if I did not, I should eat the
      corks for them! And Anderson junior called me names, and licked me. Look
      there.&rdquo; He showed a dark blue-and-red stripe raised on the palm of his
      hand. &ldquo;I could not write well for it these three days, and Hawes gave me
      double copies!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The cowardly fellows!&rdquo; exclaimed Norman indignantly. &ldquo;But you did not
      go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Anderson senior stopped them. He said he would not have the
      Ballhatchet business begin again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is one comfort,&rdquo; said Norman. &ldquo;I see he does not dare not to keep
      order. But if you&rsquo;ll only stay with me, August, I&rsquo;ll take care they don&rsquo;t
      hurt you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, June! June!&rdquo; and he threw himself across his kind brother. &ldquo;I am so
      very sorry! Oh! to see you put down&mdash;and hear them! And you to lose
      the scholarship! Oh, dear! oh, dear! and be in disgrace with them all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Tom, do cheer up. It is nothing to be in such distress at. Papa
      knows all about it, and while he does, I don&rsquo;t care half so much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I wish&mdash;I wish&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, Tom,&rdquo; said Norman, &ldquo;after all, though it is very kind of you to
      be sorry for not being able to get me out of this scrape, the thing one
      wants you to be sorry about is your own affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I had never come to school! I wish Anderson would leave me alone!
      It is all his fault! A mean-spirited, skulking, bullying&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, hush, Tom, he is bad enough, but now you know what he is, you can
      keep clear of him for the future. Now listen. You and I will make a fresh
      start, and try if we can&rsquo;t get the Mays to be looked on as they were when
      Harry was here. Let us mind the rules, and get into no more mischief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll keep me from Ned Anderson and Axworthy?&rdquo; whispered Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that I will. And you&rsquo;ll try and speak the truth, and be
      straightforward?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will, I will,&rdquo; said Tom, worn out in spirits by his long bondage, and
      glad to catch at the hope of relief and protection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then let us come home,&rdquo; and Tom put his hand into his brother&rsquo;s, as a few
      weeks back would have seemed most unworthy of schoolboy dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thenceforth Tom was devoted to Norman, and kept close to him, sure that
      the instant he was from under his wing his former companions would fall on
      him to revenge his defection, but clinging to him also from real affection
      and gratitude. Indolence and timidity were the true root of what had for a
      time seemed like a positively bad disposition; beneath, there was a warm
      heart, and sense of right, which had been almost stifled for the time, in
      the desire, from moment to moment, to avoid present trouble or fear. Under
      Norman&rsquo;s care his better self had freer scope, he was guarded from
      immediate terror, and kept from the suggestions of the worse sort of boys,
      as much as was in his brother&rsquo;s power; and the looks they cast towards
      him, and the sly torments they attempted to inflict, by no means invited
      him back to them. The lessons, where he had a long inveterate habit of
      shuffling, came under Norman&rsquo;s eye at the same time. He always prepared
      them in his presence, instead of in the most secret manner possible, and
      with all Anderson&rsquo;s expeditious modes of avoiding the making them of any
      use. Norman sat by, and gave such help as was fair and just, showed him
      how to learn, and explained difficulties, and the ingenuity hitherto spent
      in eluding learning being now directed to gaining it, he began to make
      real progress and find satisfaction in it. The comfort of being good
      dawned upon him once more, but still there was much to contend with; he
      had acquired such a habit of prevarication that, if by any means taken by
      surprise, his impulse was to avoid giving a straightforward answer, and
      when he recollected his sincerity, the truth came with the air of
      falsehood. Moreover, he was an arrant coward, and provoked tricks by his
      manifest and unreasonable terrors. It was no slight exercise of patience
      that Norman underwent, but this was the interest he had made for himself;
      and the recovery of the boy&rsquo;s attachment, and his improvement, though
      slow, were a present recompense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernescliffe, Larkins, and others of the boys, held fast to him, and after
      the first excitement was past, all the rest returned to their former tone.
      He was decidedly as much respected as ever, and, at the same time,
      regarded with more favour than when his strictness was resented. And as
      for the discipline of the school, that did not suffer. Anderson felt that,
      for his own credit, he must not allow the rules to be less observed than
      in May&rsquo;s reign, and he enforced them upon the reluctant and angry boys
      with whom he had been previously making common cause. Dr. Hoxton boasted
      to the under-masters that the school had never been in such good order as
      under Anderson, little guessing that this was but reaping the fruits of a
      past victory, or that every boy in the whole school gave the highest place
      in their esteem to the deposed dux.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Anderson, Norman&rsquo;s cordial manner and ready support were the strangest
      part of all, only explained by thinking that he deemed it, as he tried to
      do himself, merely the fortune of war, and was sensible of no injury.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, for Norman himself, when the first shock was over, and he was
      accustomed to the change, he found the cessation of vigilance a relief,
      and carried a lighter heart than any time since his mother&rsquo;s death. His
      sisters could not help observing that there was less sadness in the
      expression of his eyes, that he carried his head higher, walked with
      freedom and elasticity of step, tossed and flourished the Daisy till she
      shouted and crowed, while Margaret shrank at such freaks; and, though he
      was not much of a laugher himself, contributed much sport in the way of
      bright apposite sayings to the home circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a very unexpected mode of cure for depression of spirits, but there
      could be no question that it succeeded; and when, a few Saturdays after,
      he drove Dr. May again to Groveswood to see young Mr. Lake, who was
      recovering, he brought Margaret home a whole pile of botanical
      curiosities, and drew his father into an animated battle over natural and
      Linnaean systems, which kept the whole party merry with the pros and cons
      every evening for a week.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Oh! the golden-hearted daisies,
       Witnessed there before my youth,
     To the truth of things, with praises
       Of the beauty of the truth.&mdash;E. B. BROWNING.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Margaret, see here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor threw into her lap a letter, which made her cheeks light up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ernescliffe wrote that his father&rsquo;s friend, Captain Gordon, having
      been appointed to the frigate Alcestis, had chosen him as one of his
      lieutenants, and offered a nomination as naval cadet for his brother. He
      had replied that the navy was not Hector&rsquo;s destination, but, as Captain
      Gordon had no one else in view, had prevailed on him to pass on the
      proposal to Harry May.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan wrote in high terms of his captain, declaring that he esteemed the
      having sailed with him as one of the greatest advantages he had ever
      received, and adding that, for his own part, Dr. May needed no promise
      from him to be assured that he would watch over Harry like his own
      brother. It was believed that the Alcestis was destined for the South
      American station.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A three years&rsquo; business,&rdquo; said Dr. May, with a sigh. &ldquo;But the thing is
      done, and this is as good as we can hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Far better!&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;What pleasure it must have given him! Dear
      Harry could not sail under more favourable circumstances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I would trust to Ernescliffe as I would to Richard. It is kindly
      done, and I will thank him at once. Where does he date from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From Portsmouth. He does not say whether he has seen Harry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose he waited for my answer. Suppose I enclose a note for him to
      give to Harry. There will be rapture enough, and it is a pity he should
      not have the benefit of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor sat down to write, while Margaret worked and mused, perhaps on
      outfits and new shirts&mdash;perhaps on Harry&rsquo;s lion-locks, beneath a blue
      cap and gold band, or, perchance, on the coral shoals of the Pacific.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was one of the quiet afternoons, when all the rest were out, and which
      the doctor and his daughter especially valued, when they were able to
      spend one together without interruption. Soon, however, a ring at the door
      brought an impatient exclamation from the doctor; but his smile beamed out
      at the words, &ldquo;Miss Rivers.&rdquo; They were great friends; in fact, on terms of
      some mutual sauciness, though Meta was, as yet, far less at home with his
      daughters, and came in, looking somewhat shy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, your congeners are gone out!&rdquo; was the doctor&rsquo;s reception. &ldquo;You must
      put up with our sober selves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Flora gone far?&rdquo; asked Meta.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Cocksmoor,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;I am very sorry she has missed you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I be in your way?&rdquo; said Meta timidly. &ldquo;Papa has several things to
      do, and said he would call for me here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good luck for Margaret,&rdquo; said Dr. May.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So they are gone to Cocksmoor!&rdquo; said Meta. &ldquo;How I envy them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would not if you saw the place,&rdquo; said Dr. May. &ldquo;I believe Norman is
      very angry with me for letting them go near it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! but they are of real use there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Miss Meta is obliged to take to envying the black-hole of Cocksmoor,
      instead of being content with the eglantine bowers of Abbotstoke! I
      commiserate her!&rdquo; said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I did any good instead of harm at Abbotstoke!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harm!&rdquo; exclaimed Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They went on very well without me,&rdquo; said Meta; &ldquo;but ever since I have had
      the class they have been getting naughtier and noisier every Sunday; and,
      last Sunday, the prettiest of all&mdash;the one I liked best, and had done
      everything for&mdash;she began to mimic me&mdash;held up her finger, as I
      did, and made them all laugh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that is very bad!&rdquo; said Margaret; &ldquo;but I suppose she was a very
      little one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, a quick clever one, who knew much better, about nine years old. She
      used to be always at home in the week, dragging about a great baby; and we
      managed that her mother should afford to stay at home and send her to
      school. It seemed such a pity her cleverness should be wasted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor smiled. &ldquo;Ah! depend upon it, the tyrant-baby was the best
      disciplinarian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meta looked extremely puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa means,&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;that if she was inclined to be conceited,
      the being teased at home might do her more good than being brought forward
      at school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have done everything wrong, it seems,&rdquo; said Meta, with a shade of what
      the French call depit. &ldquo;I thought it must be right and good&mdash;but it
      has only done mischief; and now papa says they are an ungrateful set, and
      that, if it vexes me, I had better have no more to do with them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does not vex you so much as that, I hope,&rdquo; said Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I could not bear that!&rdquo; said Meta; &ldquo;but it is so different from what
      I thought!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you had an Arcadia of good little girls in straw hats, such as I see
      in Blanche&rsquo;s little books,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;all making the young lady an
      oracle, and doing wrong&mdash;if they do it at all&mdash;in the simplest
      way, just for an example to the others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. May! How can you know so well? But do you really think it is their
      fault, or mine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think me a conjurer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but what do you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do Mr. and Mrs. Charles Wilmot think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know Mrs. Wilmot thinks I spoil my class. She spoke to me about making
      favourites, and sometimes has seemed surprised at things which I have
      done. Last Sunday she told me she thought I had better have a steadier
      class, and I know whom she will give me&mdash;the great big, stupid ones,
      at the bottom of the first class! I do believe it is only out of
      good-nature that she does not tell me not to teach at all. I have a great
      mind I will not; I know I do nothing but harm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall you say if I tell you I think so too?&rdquo; asked the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Dr. May, you don&rsquo;t really? Now, does he, Miss May? I am sure I only
      want to do them good. I don&rsquo;t know what I can have done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret made her perceive that the doctor was smiling, and she changed
      her tone, and earnestly begged to be told what they thought of the case;
      for if she should show her concern at home, her father and governess would
      immediately beg her to cease from all connection with the school, and she
      did not feel at all convinced that Mrs. Wilmot liked to have her there.
      Feeling injured by the implied accusation of mismanagement, yet, with a
      sense of its truth, used to be petted, and new to rebuffs, yet with a
      sincere wish to act rightly, she was much perplexed by this, her first
      reverse, and had come partly with the view of consulting Flora, though she
      had fallen on other counsellors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Margaret, our adviser general,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;what do you say? Put
      yourself in the place of Mrs. Charles Wilmot, and say, shall Miss Rivers
      teach or not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had rather you would, papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I&mdash;I never kept school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, I being Mrs. Wilmot, should certainly be mortified if Miss
      Rivers deserted me because the children were naughty. I think, I think I
      had rather she came and asked me what she had better do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you would answer &lsquo;teach,&rsquo; for fear of vexing her,&rdquo; said Meta.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should, and also for the sake of letting her learn to teach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The point where only trial shows one&rsquo;s ignorance,&rdquo; said Dr. May.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want to do it for my own sake,&rdquo; said Meta. &ldquo;I do everything
      for my own sake already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For theirs, then,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;If teaching will not come by nature,
      you must serve an apprenticeship, if you mean to be of service in that
      line. Perhaps it was the gift that the fairies omitted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But will it do any good to them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell; but I am sure it would do them harm for you to give it up,
      because it is disagreeable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Meta, with a sigh, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and talk to Mrs. Wilmot. I could
      not bear to give up anything that seems right just now, because of the
      Confirmation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret eagerly inquired, and it appeared that the bishop had given
      notice for a Confirmation in August, and that Mr. Wilmot was already
      beginning to prepare his candidates, whilst Mr. Ramsden, always tardy,
      never gave notice till the last moment possible. The hope was expressed
      that Harry might be able to profit by this opportunity; and Harry&rsquo;s
      prospects were explained to Meta; then the doctor, recollecting something
      that he wished to say to Mr. Rivers, began to ask about the chance of his
      coming before the time of an engagement of his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said he should be here at about half-past four,&rdquo; said Meta. &ldquo;He is
      gone to the station to inquire about the trains. Do you know what time the
      last comes in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At nine forty-five,&rdquo; said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what we were afraid of. It is for Bellairs, my maid. Her mother
      is very ill, and she is afraid she is not properly nursed. It is about
      five miles from the Milbury Station, and we thought of letting her go with
      a day-ticket to see about her. She could go in the morning, after I am up;
      but I don&rsquo;t know what is to be done, for she could not get back before I
      dress for dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret felt perfectly aghast at the cool tone, especially after what had
      passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be quite impossible,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;Even going by the eight
      o&rsquo;clock train, and returning by the last, she would only have two hours to
      spare&mdash;short enough measure for a sick mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa means to give her whatever she wants for any nurse she may get.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there no one with her mother now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A son&rsquo;s wife, who, they think, is not kind. Poor Bellairs was so grateful
      for being allowed to go home. I wonder if I could dress for once without
      her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know old Crabbe?&rdquo; said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dear old man at Abbotstoke? Oh, yes, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was a very sad case in his family. The mother was dying of a
      lingering illness, when the son met with a bad accident. The only daughter
      was a lady&rsquo;s-maid, and could not be spared, though the brother was half
      crazy to see her, and there was no one to tend them but a wretch of a
      woman, paid by the parish. The poor fellow kept calling for his sister in
      his delirium, and, at last, I could not help writing to the mistress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she let her come?&rdquo; said Meta, her cheek glowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a great favour, she let her set out by the mail train, after dressing
      her for a ball, with orders to return in time for her toilette for an
      evening party the next day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I remember,&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;her coming here at five in the morning,
      and your taking her home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when we got to Abbotstoke the brother was dead. That parish nurse had
      not attended to my directions, and, I do believe, was the cause of it. The
      mother had had a seizure, and was in the most precarious state.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely she stayed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was as much as her place was worth,&rdquo; said the doctor; &ldquo;and her wages
      were the chief maintenance of the family. So she had to go back to dress
      her mistress, while the old woman lay there, wailing after Betsy. She did
      give warning then, but, before the month was out, the mother was dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meta did not speak, and Dr. May presently rose, saying he should try to
      meet Mr. Rivers in the town, and went out. Meta sat thoughtful, and at
      last, sighing, said, &ldquo;I wonder whether Bellairs&rsquo;s mother is so very ill? I
      have a great mind to let Susan try to do my hair, and let Bellairs stay a
      little longer. I never thought of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not think you will be sorry,&rdquo; said Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I shall, for if my hair does not look nice, papa will not be
      pleased, and there is Aunt Leonora coming. How odd it will be to be
      without Bellairs! I will ask Mrs. Larpent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;You must not think we meant to advise; but papa
      has seen so many instances of distress, from servants not spared to their
      friends in illness, that he feels strongly on the subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I really might have been as cruel as that woman!&rdquo; said Meta. &ldquo;Well, I
      hope Mrs. Bellairs may be better, and able to spare her daughter. I don&rsquo;t
      know what will become of me without her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it will have been a satisfaction in one way,&rdquo; said Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember what you began by complaining of, that you could not
      be of use? Now, I fancy this would give you the pleasure of undergoing a
      little personal inconvenience for the good of another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meta looked half puzzled, half thoughtful, and Margaret, who was a little
      uneasy at the style of counsel she found herself giving, changed the
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a memorable one to little Miss Rivers, opening out to her, as did
      almost all her meetings with that family, a new scope for thought and for
      duty. The code to which she had been brought up taught that servants were
      the machines of their employer&rsquo;s convenience. Good-nature occasioned much
      kindliness of manner and intercourse, and every luxury and indulgence was
      afforded freely; but where there was any want of accordance between the
      convenience of the two parties, there was no question. The master must be
      the first object, the servants&rsquo; remedy was in their own hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amiable as was Mr. Rivers, this, merely from indulgence and want of
      reflection, was his principle; and his daughter had only been acting on
      it, though she did not know it, till the feelings that she had never
      thought of were thus displayed before her. These were her first practical
      lessons that life was not meant to be passed in pleasing ourselves, and
      being good-natured at small cost.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an effort. Meta was very dependent, never having been encouraged to
      be otherwise, and Bellairs was like a necessary of life in her estimation;
      but strength of principle came to aid her naturally kind-hearted feeling,
      and she was pleased by the idea of voluntarily undergoing a privation so
      as to test her sincerity.
    </p>
    <p>
      So when her father told her of the inconvenient times of the trains, and
      declared that Bellairs must give it up, she answered by proposing to let
      her sleep a night or two there, gaily promised to manage very well, and
      satisfied him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her maid&rsquo;s grateful looks and thanks recompensed her when she made the
      offer to her, and inspirited her to an energetic coaxing of Mrs. Larpent,
      who, being more fully aware than her father of the needfulness of the
      lady&rsquo;s-maid, and also very anxious that her darling should appear to the
      best advantage before the expected aunt, Lady Leonora Langdale, was
      unwilling to grant more than one night at the utmost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meta carried the day, and her last assurance to Bellairs was that she
      might stay as long as seemed necessary to make her mother comfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon Meta found herself more helpful in some matters than she had
      expected, but at a loss in others. Susan, with all Mrs. Larpent&rsquo;s
      supervision, could not quite bring her dress to the air that was so
      peculiarly graceful and becoming; and she often caught her papa&rsquo;s eye
      looking at her as if he saw something amiss, and could not discover what
      it was. Then came Aunt Leonora, always very kind to Meta, but the dread of
      the rest of the household, whom she was wont to lecture on the proper care
      of her niece. Miss Rivers was likely to have a considerable fortune, and
      Lady Leonora intended her to be a very fashionable and much admired young
      lady, under her own immediate protection.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two cousins, Leonora and Agatha, talked to her; the one of her balls,
      the other of her music&mdash;patronised her, and called her their good
      little cousin&mdash;while they criticised the stiff set of those
      unfortunate plaits made by Susan, and laughed, as if it was an unheard-of
      concession, at Bellairs&rsquo;s holiday.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, when &ldquo;Honoured Miss&rdquo; received a note, begging for three
      days&rsquo; longer grace, till a niece should come, in whom Bellairs could place
      full confidence, she took it on herself to return free consent. Lady
      Leonora found out what she had done, and reproved her, telling her it was
      only the way to make &ldquo;those people&rdquo; presume, and Mrs. Larpent was also
      taken to task; but, decidedly, Meta did not regret what she had done,
      though she felt as if she had never before known how to appreciate
      comfort, when she once more beheld Bellairs stationed at her toilette
      table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meta was asked about her friends. She could not mention any one but Mrs.
      Charles Wilmot and the Misses May.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Physician&rsquo;s daughters; oh!&rdquo; said Lady Leonora.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she proceeded to exhort Mr. Rivers to bring his daughter to London, or
      its neighbourhood, where she might have masters, and be in the way of
      forming intimacies suited to her connections.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Rivers dreaded London&mdash;never was well there, and did not like the
      trouble of moving&mdash;while Meta was so attached to the Grange, that she
      entreated him not to think of leaving it, and greatly dreaded her aunt&rsquo;s
      influence. Lady Leonora did, indeed, allow that the Grange was a very
      pretty place; her only complaint was the want of suitable society for
      Meta; she could not bear the idea of her growing accustomed&mdash;for want
      of something better&mdash;to the vicar&rsquo;s wife and the pet doctor&rsquo;s
      daughters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora had been long desirous to effect a regular call at Abbotstoke, and
      it was just now that she succeeded. Mrs. Charles Wilmot&rsquo;s little girl was
      to have a birthday feast, at which Mary, Blanche, and Aubrey were to
      appear. Flora went in charge of them, and as soon as she had safely
      deposited them, and appointed Mary to keep Aubrey out of mischief, she
      walked up to the Grange, not a whit daunted by the report of the very fine
      ladies who were astonishing the natives of Abbotstoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was admitted, and found herself in the drawing-room, with a quick
      lively-looking lady, whom she perceived to be Lady Leonora, and who
      instantly began talking to her very civilly. Flora was never at a loss,
      and they got on extremely well; her ease and self-possession, without
      forwardness, telling much to her advantage. Meta came in, delighted to see
      her, but, of course, the visit resulted in no really intimate talk, though
      it was not without effect. Flora declared Lady Leonora Langdale to be a
      most charming person; and Lady Leonora, on her side, asked Meta who was
      that very elegant conversible girl. &ldquo;Flora May,&rdquo; was the delighted answer,
      now that the aunt had committed herself by commendation. And she did not
      retract it; she pronounced Flora to be something quite out of the common
      way, and supposed that she had had unusual advantages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Rivers took care to introduce to his sister-in-law Dr. May (who would
      fain have avoided it), but ended by being in his turn pleased and
      entertained by her brilliant conversation, which she put forth for him, as
      her instinct showed her that she was talking to a man of high ability. A
      perfect gentleman she saw him to be, and making out some mutual
      connections far up in the family tree of the Mackenzies, she decided that
      the May family were an acquisition, and very good companions for her niece
      at present, while not yet come out. So ended the visit, with this great
      triumph for Meta, who had a strong belief in Aunt Leonora&rsquo;s power and
      infallibility, and yet had not consulted her about Bellairs, nor about the
      school question.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had missed one Sunday&rsquo;s school on account of her aunt&rsquo;s visit, but the
      resolution made beside Margaret&rsquo;s sofa had not been forgotten. She spent
      her Saturday afternoon in a call on Mrs. Wilmot, ending with a walk
      through the village; she confessed her ignorance, apologised for her
      blunders, and put herself under the direction which once she had fancied
      too strict and harsh to be followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      And on Sunday she was content to teach the stupid girls, and abstain from
      making much of the smooth-faced engaging set. She thought it very dull
      work, but she could feel that it was something not done to please herself;
      and whereas her father had feared she would be dull when her cousins were
      gone, he found her more joyous than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      There certainly was a peculiar happiness about Margaret Rivers; her
      vexations were but ripples, rendering the sunny course of her life more
      sparkling, and each exertion in the way of goodness was productive of so
      much present joy that the steps of her ladder seemed, indeed, to be of
      diamonds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her ladder&mdash;for she was, indeed, mounting upwards. She was very
      earnest in her Confirmation preparation, most anxious to do right and to
      contend with her failings; but the struggle at present was easy; and the
      hopes, joys, and incentives shone out more and more upon her in this
      blithe stage of her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew there was a dark side, but hope and love were more present to her
      than was fear. Happy those to whom such young days are granted.

    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     It is the generous spirit, who, when brought
     Among the tasks of real life, hath wrought
     Upon the plan that pleased his childish thought,
     Whose high endeavours are an inward light,
     Making the path before him always bright.
                                          WORDSWORTH.
</pre>
    <p>
      The holidays had commenced about a week when Harry, now duly appointed to
      H. M. S. Alcestis, was to come home on leave, as he proudly expressed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      A glad troop of brothers and sisters, with the doctor himself, walked up
      to the station to meet him, and who was happiest when, from the window,
      was thrust out the rosy face, with the gold band? Mary gave such a shriek
      and leap, that two passengers and one guard turned round to look at her,
      to the extreme discomfiture of Flora and Norman, evidenced by one by a
      grave &ldquo;Mary! Mary!&rdquo; by the other, by walking off to the extreme end of the
      platform, and trying to look as if he did not belong to them, in which he
      was imitated by his shadow, Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sailor already, rather than schoolboy, Harry cared not for spectators; his
      bound from the carriage, and the hug between him, and Mary would have been
      worthy of the return from the voyage. The next greeting was for his
      father, and the sisters had had their share by the time the two brothers
      thought fit to return from their calm walk on the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grand was it to see that party return to the town&mdash;the naval cadet,
      with his arm linked in Mary&rsquo;s, and Aubrey clinging to his hand, and the
      others walking behind, admiring him as he turned his bright face every
      moment with some glad question or answer, &ldquo;How was Margaret?&rdquo; Oh, so much
      better; she had been able to walk across the room, with Norman&rsquo;s arm round
      her&mdash;they hoped she would soon use crutches&mdash;and she sat up
      more. &ldquo;And the baby?&rdquo; More charming than ever&mdash;four teeth&mdash;would
      soon walk&mdash;such a darling! Then came &ldquo;my dirk, the ship, our berth.&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Papa, do ask Mr. Ernescliffe to come here. I know he could get leave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Ernescliffe! You used to call him Alan!&rdquo; said Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but that is all over now. You forget what we do on board. Captain
      Gordon himself calls me Mr. May!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some laughed, others were extremely impressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! There&rsquo;s Ned Anderson coming,&rdquo; cried Mary. &ldquo;Now! Let him see you,
      Harry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What matters Ned Anderson to me?&rdquo; said Harry; and, with an odd mixture of
      shamefacedness and cordiality, he marched full up to his old
      school-fellow, and shook hands with him, as if able, in the plenitude of
      his officership, to afford plenty of good-humoured superiority. Tom had
      meantime subsided out of all view. But poor Harry&rsquo;s exultation had a fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; graciously inquired &lsquo;Mr. May&rsquo;, &ldquo;and how is Harvey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, very well. We are expecting him home to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where has he been?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Oxford, about the Randall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harry gave a disturbed, wondering look round, on seeing Edward&rsquo;s air of
      malignant satisfaction. He saw nothing that reassured him, except the
      quietness of Norman&rsquo;s own face, but even that altered as their eyes met.
      Before another word could be said, however, the doctor&rsquo;s hand was on
      Harry&rsquo;s shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not keep him now, Ned,&rdquo; said he&mdash;&ldquo;his sister has not seen
      him yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he moved his little procession onwards, still resting on Harry&rsquo;s
      shoulder, while a silence had fallen on all, and even the young sailor
      ventured no question. Only Tom&rsquo;s lips were quivering, and Ethel had
      squeezed Norman&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Poor Harry!&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;this is worst of all!
      I wish we had written it to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So do I now, but we always trusted it would come right. Oh! if I were but
      a boy to flog that Edward!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, Ethel, remember what we resolved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were entering their own garden, where, beneath the shade of the
      tulip-tree, Margaret lay on her couch. Her arms were held out, and Harry
      threw himself upon her, but when he rose from her caress, Norman and Tom
      were gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; he now first ventured to ask.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come with me,&rdquo; said Dr. May, leading the way to his study, where he
      related the whole history of the suspicion that Norman had incurred. He
      was glad that he had done so in private, for Harry&rsquo;s indignation and grief
      went beyond his expectations; and when at last it appeared that Harvey
      Anderson was actually Randall-scholar, after opening his eyes with the
      utmost incredulity, and causing it to be a second time repeated, he gave a
      gulp or two, turned very red, and ended by laying his head on the table,
      and fairly sobbing and crying aloud, in spite of dirk, uniform, and
      manhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harry! why, Harry, my boy! We should have prepared you for this,&rdquo; said
      the doctor affectionately. &ldquo;We have left off breaking our hearts about it.
      I don&rsquo;t want any comfort now for having gold instead of glitter; though at
      first I was as bad as you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, if I had but been there!&rdquo; said Harry, combating unsuccessfully with
      his tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! so we all said, Norman and all. Your word would have cleared him&mdash;that
      is, if you had not been in the thick of the mischief. Ha! July, should not
      you have been on the top of the wall?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would have stood by him, at least. Would not I have given Axworthy and
      Anderson two such black eyes as they could not have shown in school for a
      week? They had better look out!&rdquo; cried Harry savagely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! An officer in her Majesty&rsquo;s service! Eh, Mr. May?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, papa, don&rsquo;t. Oh! I thought it would have been so happy, when I
      came home, to see Norman Randall-scholar. Oh! now I don&rsquo;t care for the
      ship, nor anything.&rdquo; Again Harry&rsquo;s face went down on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, Harry,&rdquo; said Dr. May, pulling off the spectacles that had
      become very dewy, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t let us make fools of ourselves, or they will
      think we are dying for the scholarship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care for the scholarship, but to have June turned down&mdash;and
      disgrace&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I care for, Harry, is having June what he is, and that I know better
      now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is! he is&mdash;he is June himself, and no mistake!&rdquo; cried Harry, with
      vehemence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The prime of the year, is not it?&rdquo; said the doctor, smiling, as he
      stroked down the blue sleeve, as if he thought that generous July did not
      fall far short of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That he is!&rdquo; exclaimed Harry. &ldquo;I have never met one fellow like him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be a chance if you ever do,&rdquo; said Dr. May. &ldquo;That is better than
      scholarships!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It should have been both,&rdquo; said Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Norman thinks the disappointment has been very good for him,&rdquo; said the
      doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it made him what he is now. All success is no discipline, you
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harry looked as if he did not know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you will understand better by-and-by, but this I can tell you,
      Harry, that the patient bearing of his vexation has done more to renew
      Norman&rsquo;s spirits than all his prosperity. See if if has not. I believe it
      is harder to every one of us, than to him. To Ethel, especially, it is a
      struggle to be in charity with the Andersons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In charity!&rdquo; repeated Harry. &ldquo;Papa! you don&rsquo;t want us to like a horrid,
      sneaking, mean-spirited pair like those, that have used Norman in that
      shameful way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, certainly not; I only want you to feel no more personal anger than if
      it had been Cheviot, or some indifferent person, that had been injured.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have hated them all the same!&rdquo; cried Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it is all the same, and it is the treachery you hate, I ask no more,&rdquo;
       said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it, papa, I can&rsquo;t! If I were to meet those fellows, do you
      think I could shake hands with them? If I did not lick Ned all down
      Minster Street, he might think himself lucky.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Harry, I won&rsquo;t argue any more. I have no right to preach
      forbearance. Your brother&rsquo;s example is better worth than my precept. Shall
      we go back to Margaret, or have you anything to say to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harry made no positive answer, but pressed close to his father, who put
      his arm round him, while the curly head was laid on his shoulder.
      Presently he said, with a great sigh, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing like home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was that what you wanted to say?&rdquo; asked Dr. May, smiling, as he held the
      boy more closely to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but it will be a long time before I come back. They think we shall
      have orders for the Pacific.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will come home our real lion,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;How much you will
      have to tell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Harry; &ldquo;but oh! it is very different from coming home every
      night, not having any one to tell a thing to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want to say anything now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I told you in my letter about the half-sovereign.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, never mind that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there was one night, I am afraid, I did not stand by a little fellow
      that they bullied about his prayers. Perhaps he would have gone on, if I
      had helped him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he sail with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he was at school. If I had told him that he and I would stand by each
      other&mdash;but he looked so foolish, and began to cry! I am sorry now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weak spirits have much to bear,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;and you stronger ones,
      who don&rsquo;t mind being bullied, are meant, I suppose, to help them, as
      Norman has been doing by poor little Tommy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was thinking of Norman&mdash;that made me sorry. I knew there was
      something else, but you see I forget when I don&rsquo;t see you and Margaret
      every day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have One always near, my boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, but I cannot always recollect. And there is such a row at night
      on board, I cannot think or attend as I ought,&rdquo; murmured Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, your life, sleeping at home in quiet, has not prepared you for that
      trial,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;But others have kept upright habits under the
      same, you know&mdash;and God helps those who are doing their best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harry sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean to do my best,&rdquo; he added; &ldquo;and if it was not for feeling bad, I
      should like it. I do like it&rdquo;&mdash;and his eye sparkled, and his smile
      beamed, though the tear was undried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you do!&rdquo; said Dr. May, smiling, &ldquo;and for feeling bad, my Harry, I
      fear you must do that by sea, or land, as long as you are in this world.
      God be thanked that you grieve over the feeling. But He is ready to aid,
      and knows the trial, and you will be brought nearer to Him before you
      leave us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Margaret wrote about the Confirmation. Am I old enough?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you wish it, Harry, under these circumstances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I do,&rdquo; said Harry, uneasily twirling a button.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But then, if I&rsquo;ve got to forgive the Andersons&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t talk any more of that,&rdquo; said the doctor; &ldquo;here is poor Mary,
      reconnoitring, to know why I am keeping you from her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then began the scampering up and down the house, round and round the
      garden, visiting every pet or haunt or contrivance; Mary and Harry at the
      head, Blanche and Tom in full career after them, and Aubrey stumping and
      scrambling at his utmost speed, far behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a word passed between Norman and Harry on the school misadventure,
      but, after the outbreak of the latter, he treated it as a thing forgotten,
      and brought all his high spirits to enliven the family party. Richard,
      too, returned later on the same day, and though not received with the same
      uproarious joy as Harry, the elder section of the family were as happy in
      their way as what Blanche called the middle-aged. The Daisy was brought
      down, and the eleven were again all in the same room, though there were
      suppressed sighs from some, who reflected how long it might be before they
      could again assemble.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tea went off happily in the garden, with much laughing and talking. &ldquo;Pity
      to leave such good company!&rdquo; said the doctor, unwillingly rising at last&mdash;&ldquo;but
      I must go to the Union&mdash;I promised Ward to meet him there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, let me walk with you!&rdquo; cried Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And me!&rdquo; cried other voices, and the doctor proposed that they should
      wait for him in the meads, and extend the walk after the visit. Richard
      and Ethel both expressing their intention of adhering to Margaret&mdash;the
      latter observing how nice it would be to get rid of everybody, and have a
      talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have we been doing all this time?&rdquo; said Dr. May, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chattering, not conversing,&rdquo; said Ethel saucily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay! the Cocksmoor board is going to sit,&rdquo; said Dr. May.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is a board?&rdquo; inquired Blanche, who had just come down prepared for
      her walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard, Margaret, and Ethel, when they sit upon Cocksmoor,&rdquo; said Dr.
      May.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Margaret never does sit on Cocksmoor, papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only allegorically, Blanche,&rdquo; said Norman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t understand what is a board?&rdquo; pursued Blanche.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. May in his ship,&rdquo; was Norman&rsquo;s suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Blanche stood in perplexity. &ldquo;What is it really?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something wooden headed,&rdquo; continued the provoking papa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A board is all wooden, not only its head,&rdquo; said Blanche.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly so, especially at Stoneborough!&rdquo; said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is what papa is when he comes out of the council-room,&rdquo; added Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or what every one is while the girls are rigging themselves,&rdquo; sighed
      Harry. &ldquo;Ha! here&rsquo;s Polly&mdash;now we only want Flora.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And my stethoscope! Has any one seen my stethoscope!&rdquo; exclaimed the
      doctor, beginning to rush frantically into the study, dining-room, and his
      own room; but failing, quietly took up a book, and gave up the search,
      which was vigorously pursued by Richard, Flora, and Mary, until the
      missing article was detected, where Aubrey had left it in the nook on the
      stairs, after using it for a trumpet and a telescope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! now my goods will have a chance!&rdquo; said Dr. May, as he took it, and
      patted Richard&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;I have my best right hand, and Margaret will
      be saved endless sufferings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay! poor dear! don&rsquo;t I see what she undergoes, when nobody will remember
      that useful proverb, &lsquo;A place for everything, and everything in its
      place.&rsquo; I believe one use of her brains is to make an inventory of all the
      things left about the drawing-room; but, beyond it, it is past her power.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Flora, rather aggrieved; &ldquo;I do the best I can, but, when
      nobody ever puts anything into its place, what can I do, single-handed? So
      no one ever goes anywhere without first turning the house upside down for
      their property; and Aubrey, and now even baby, are always carrying
      whatever they can lay hands on into the nursery. I can&rsquo;t bear it; and the
      worst of it is that,&rdquo; she added, finishing her lamentation, after the
      others were out at the door, &ldquo;papa and Ethel have neither of them the
      least shame about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, Flora, that is not fair!&rdquo; exclaimed Margaret&mdash;but Flora was
      gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have shame,&rdquo; sighed Ethel, walking across the room disconsolately, to
      put a book into a shelf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you don&rsquo;t leave things trainants as you used,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;That is what
      I meant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I did not,&rdquo; said Ethel; &ldquo;I was thinking whether I had better not
      make myself pay a forfeit. Suppose you keep a book for me, Margaret, and
      make a mark against me at everything I leave about, and if I pay a
      farthing for each, it will be so much away from Cocksmoor, so I must cure
      myself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what shall become of the forfeits?&rdquo; asked Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, they won&rsquo;t be enough to be worth having, I hope,&rdquo; said Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give them to the Ladies&rsquo; Committee,&rdquo; said Ethel, making a face. &ldquo;Oh,
      Ritchie! they are worse than ever. We are so glad that Flora is going to
      join it, and see whether she can do any good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We?&rdquo; said Margaret, hesitating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I know you aren&rsquo;t, but papa said she might&mdash;and you know she has
      so much tact and management&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As Norman says,&rdquo; observed Margaret doubtfully. &ldquo;I cannot like the notion
      of Flora going and squabbling with Mrs. Ledwich and Louisa Anderson!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think, Ritchie?&rdquo; asked Ethel. &ldquo;Is it not too bad that they
      should have it all their own way, and spoil the whole female population?
      Why, the last thing they did was to leave off reading the Prayer-book
      prayers morning and evening! And it is much expected that next they will
      attack all learning by heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is too bad,&rdquo; said Richard, &ldquo;but Flora can hardly hinder them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be one voice,&rdquo; said Ethel; &ldquo;but oh! if I could only say half what
      I have in my mind, they must see the error. Why, these, these&mdash;what
      they call formal&mdash;these the ties&mdash;links on to the Church&mdash;on
      to what is good&mdash;if they don&rsquo;t learn them soundly&mdash;rammed down
      hard&mdash;you know what I mean&mdash;so that they can&rsquo;t remember the
      first&mdash;remember when they did not know them&mdash;they will never get
      to learn&mdash;know&mdash;understand when they can understand!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Ethel, don&rsquo;t frown so horribly, or it will spoil your eloquence,&rdquo;
       said Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand either,&rdquo; said Richard gravely. &ldquo;Not understand when
      they can understand? What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Ritchie, don&rsquo;t you see? If they don&rsquo;t learn them&mdash;hard, firm,
      by rote when they can&rsquo;t&mdash;they won&rsquo;t understand when they can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they don&rsquo;t learn when they can&rsquo;t, they won&rsquo;t understand when they
      can?&rdquo; puzzled Richard, making Margaret laugh; but Ethel was too much in
      earnest for amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they don&rsquo;t learn them by rote when they have strong memories. Yes,
      that&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; she continued; &ldquo;they will not know them well enough to
      understand them when they are old enough!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who won&rsquo;t learn and understand what?&rdquo; said Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Ritchie, Ritchie! Why the children&mdash;the Psalms&mdash;the Gospels&mdash;the
      things. They ought to know them, love them, grow up to them, before they
      know the meaning, or they won&rsquo;t care. Memory, association, affection, all
      those come when one is younger than comprehension!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Younger than one&rsquo;s own comprehension?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard, you are grown more tiresome than ever. Are you laughing at me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, I beg your pardon&mdash;I did not mean it,&rdquo; said Richard. &ldquo;I am
      very sorry to be so stupid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Ritchie, it was only my blundering&mdash;never mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what did you mean? I want to know, indeed, Ethel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean that memory and association come before comprehension, so that one
      ought to know all good things&mdash;fa&mdash;with familiarity before one
      can understand, because understanding does not make one love. Oh! one does
      that before, and, when the first little gleam, little bit of a sparklet of
      the meaning does come, then it is so valuable and so delightful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never heard of a little bit of a sparklet before,&rdquo; said Richard, &ldquo;but I
      think I do see what Ethel means; and it is like what I heard and liked in
      a university sermon some Sundays ago, saying that these lessons and holy
      words were to be impressed on us here from infancy on earth, that we might
      be always unravelling their meaning, and learn it fully at last&mdash;where
      we hope to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The very same thought!&rdquo; exclaimed Margaret, delighted; &ldquo;but,&rdquo; after a
      pause, &ldquo;I am afraid the Ladies&rsquo; Committee might not enter into it in plain
      English, far less in Ethel&rsquo;s language.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Margaret! You know I never meant myself. I never can get the right
      words for what I mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you leave about your faux commencements, as M. Ballompre would call
      them, for us to stumble over,&rdquo; said Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Flora would manage!&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;She has power over people, and can
      influence them. Oh, Ritchie, don&rsquo;t persuade papa out of letting her go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does Mr. Wilmot wish it?&rdquo; asked Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not heard him say, but he was very much vexed about the prayers,&rdquo;
       said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will he stay here for the holidays?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, his father has not been well, and he is gone to take his duty. He
      walked with us to Cocksmoor before he went, and we did so wish for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How have you been getting on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty well, on the whole,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;but, oh, dear! oh, dear,
      Richard, the M&rsquo;Carthys are gone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone, where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, to Wales. I knew nothing of it till they were off. Una and Fergus
      were missing, and Jane Taylor told me they were all gone. Oh, it is so
      horrid! Una had really come to be so good and so much in earnest. She
      behaved so well at school and church, that even Mrs. Ledwich liked her,
      and she used to read her Testament half the day, and bring her
      Sunday-school lessons to ask me about! Oh! I was so fond of her, and it
      really seemed to have done some good with her. And now it is all lost! Oh,
      I wish I knew what would become of my poor child!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The only hope is that it may not be all lost,&rdquo; said Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With such a woman for a mother!&rdquo; said Ethel; &ldquo;and going to some
      heathenish place again! If I could only have seen her first, and begged
      her to go to church and say her prayers. If I only knew where she is gone!
      but I don&rsquo;t. I did think Una would have come to wish me good-bye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very sorry to lose her,&rdquo; said Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Wilmot says it is bread cast on the waters,&rdquo; said Margaret&mdash;&ldquo;he
      was very kind in consoling Ethel, who came home quite in despair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he said it was one of the trials,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;and that it might be
      better for Una as well as for me. And I am trying to care for the rest
      still, but I cannot yet as I did for her. There are none of the eyes that
      look as if they were eating up one&rsquo;s words before they come, and that
      smile of comprehension! Oh, they all are such stupid little dolts, and so
      indifferent!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Ethel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fancy last Friday&mdash;Mary and I found only eight there&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember what a broiling day Friday was?&rdquo; interrupted Margaret.
      &ldquo;Miss Winter and Norman both told me I ought not to let them go, and I
      began to think so when they came home. Mary was the colour of a peony!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! it would not have signified if the children had been good for
      anything, but all their mothers were out at work, and, of those that did
      come, hardly one had learned their lessons&mdash;Willy Blake had lost his
      spelling-card; Anne Harris kicked Susan Pope, and would not say she was
      sorry; Mary Hale would not know M from N, do all our Mary would; and Jane
      Taylor, after all the pains I have taken with her, when I asked how the
      Israelites crossed the Red Sea, seemed never to have heard of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret could have said that Ethel had come in positively crying with
      vexation, but with no diminution of the spirit of perseverance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so glad you are come, Richard!&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;You will put a
      little new life into them. They all looked so pleased when we told them
      Mr. Richard was coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope we shall get on,&rdquo; said Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to judge whether the Popes are civilised enough to be dressed
      for Sunday-school. Oh, and the money! Here is the account-book&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How neatly you have kept it, Ethel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! it was for you, you know. Receipts&mdash;see, aren&rsquo;t you surprised?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four pounds eighteen and eightpence! That is a great deal!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The three guineas were Mr. Rivers&rsquo;s fees, you know; then, Margaret gave
      us half-a-sovereign, and Mary a shilling, and there was one that we picked
      up, tumbling about the house, and papa said we might have, and the
      twopence were little Blanche&rsquo;s savings. Oh, Ritchie!&rdquo; as a bright coin
      appeared on the book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all I could save this term,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it is famous! Now, I do think I may put another whole sovereign away
      into the purse for the church. See, here is what we have paid. Shoes&mdash;those
      did bring our money very low, and then I bought a piece of print which
      cost sixteen shillings, but it will make plenty of frocks. So, you see,
      the balance is actually two pounds nine! That is something. The nine
      shillings will go on till we get another fee; for I have two frocks ready
      made for the Popes, so the two pounds are a real nest-egg towards the
      church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The church!&rdquo; repeated Rlchard, half smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I looked in the paper the other day, and saw that a chapel had been built
      for nine hundred pounds,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have two!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two in eight months, Ritchie, and more will come as we get older. I have
      a scheme in my head, but I won&rsquo;t tell you now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nine hundred! And a church has to be endowed as well as built, you know,
      Ethel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! never mind that now. If we can begin and build, some good person will
      come and help. I&rsquo;ll run and fetch it, Ritchie. I drew out a sketch of what
      I want it to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a girl that is!&rdquo; said Richard, as Ethel dashed away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is not she?&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;And she means all so heartily. Do you know
      she has spent nothing on her own pleasures, not a book, not a thing has
      she bought this year, except a present for Blanche&rsquo;s birthday, and some
      silk to net a purse for Harry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot help being sometimes persuaded that she will succeed,&rdquo; said
      Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, energy, self-denial, perseverance, they go a great way,&rdquo; said
      Margaret. &ldquo;And yet when we look at poor dear Ethel, and her queer ungainly
      ways, and think of her building a church!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Neither Richard nor Margaret could help laughing, but they checked it at
      once, and the former said, &ldquo;That brave spirit is a reproof to us all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Margaret; &ldquo;and so is the resolution to mend her little
      faults.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel came back, having, of course, mislaid her sketch, and, much vexed,
      wished to know if it ought to cause her first forfeit, but Margaret
      thought these should not begin till the date of the agreement, and the
      three resumed the Cocksmoor discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      It lasted till the return of the walking party, so late, that they had
      been star-gazing, and came in, in full dispute as to which was Cygnus and
      which Aquila, while Blanche was talking very grandly of Taurus
      Poniatouski, and Harry begging to be told which constellations he should
      still see in the southern hemisphere. Dr. May was the first to rectify the
      globe for the southern latitudes, and fingers were affectionately laid on
      Orion&rsquo;s studded belt, as though he were a friend who would accompany the
      sailor-boy. Voices grew loud and eager in enumerating the stars common to
      both; and so came bedtime, and the globe stood on the table in danger of
      being forgotten. Ethel diligently lifted it up; and while Norman exclaimed
      at her tidiness, Margaret told how a new leaf was to be turned, and of her
      voluntary forfeits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very good plan,&rdquo; cried the doctor. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t do better than follow her
      example.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you, papa? Oh, what fun!&rdquo; exclaimed Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you think I shall be ruined, Mr. Monkey. How do you know I shall not
      be the most orderly of all? A penny for everything left about, confiscated
      for the benefit of Cocksmoor, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And twopence for pocket-handkerchiefs, if you please,&rdquo; said Norman, with
      a gesture of disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. From Blanche, upwards. Margaret shall have a book, and set
      down marks against us&mdash;hold an audit every Saturday night. What say
      you, Blanche?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I hope Flora will leave something about!&rdquo; cried Blanche, dancing with
      glee.

      CHAPTER XXV.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Oh, no, we never mention her,
     We never breathe her name.&mdash;SONG.
</pre>
    <p>
      A great deal of merriment had come home with Harry, who never was grave
      for ten minutes without a strong reaction, and distracted the house with
      his noise and his antics, in proportion, as it sometimes seemed, to the
      spaces of serious thought and reading spent in the study, where Dr. May
      did his best to supply Mr. Ramsden&rsquo;s insufficient attention to his
      Confirmation candidates, by giving an hour every day to Norman, Ethel, and
      Harry. He could not lecture, but he read with them, and his own
      earnestness was very impressive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two eldest felt deeply, but Harry often kept it in doubt, whether he
      were not as yet too young and wild for permanent impressions, so rapid
      were his transitions, and so overpowering his high spirits. Not that these
      were objected to; but there was a feeling that there might as well be
      moderation in all things, and that it would have been satisfactory if,
      under present circumstances, he had been somewhat more subdued and
      diligent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are your decimals not done yet, Harry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For Harry, being somewhat deficient in arithmetic, had been recommended to
      work in that line during his visit at home&mdash;an operation usually
      deferred, as at present, to the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to do my sums now, Flora,&rdquo; said Harry, somewhat annoyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He really fetched his arithmetic, and his voice was soon heard asking how
      he was ever to put an end to a sum that would turn to nothing but
      everlasting threes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you been doing, young ladies?&rdquo; asked Dr. May. &ldquo;Did you call on
      Miss Walkingham?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flora and Blanche did,&rdquo; said Ethel; &ldquo;I thought you did not want me to go,
      and I had not time. Besides, a London grand young lady&mdash;oh!&rdquo; and
      Ethel shook her head in disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not the way you treat Meta Rivers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Meta is different! She has never been out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have been glad for you to have seen Miss Walkingham,&rdquo; said her
      father. &ldquo;Pretty manners are improving; besides, old Lady Walkingham begged
      me to send my daughters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should not have seen her,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;for she was not well enough to
      let us in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it not pushing?&rdquo; said Flora. &ldquo;There were the Andersons leaving their
      card!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those Andersons!&rdquo; exclaimed the doctor; &ldquo;I am sick of the very sound of
      the name. As sure as my name is Dick May, I&rsquo;ll include it in Margaret&rsquo;s
      book of fines.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flora looked dignified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are always harping on that little trumpery girl&rsquo;s nonsense,&rdquo; said
      Harry. &ldquo;Aught, aught, eight, that is eight thousandths, eh, Norman! If it
      was about those two fellows, the boys&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would harp only on what affects you?&rdquo; said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t; men never do. That is one hundred and twenty-fifth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One man does it to an hundred and twenty-five women?&rdquo; said Dr. May.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is rather a female defect, indeed,&rdquo; said Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Defect!&rdquo; said Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Dr. May, &ldquo;since it is not only irksome to the hearers, but
      leads to the breaking of the ninth commandment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Many voices declared, in forms of varying severity, that it was impossible
      to speak worse of the Andersons than they deserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Andersons again!&rdquo; cried Dr. May. &ldquo;One, two, three, four, five, six
      forfeits!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa himself, for he said the name,&rdquo; saucily put in Blanche.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I should like the rule to be made in earnest,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! in order to catch Flora&rsquo;s pence for Cocksmoor?&rdquo; suggested Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but because it is malice. I mean, that is, if there is dislike, or a
      grudge in our hearts at them&mdash;talking for ever of nasty little
      miserable irritations makes it worse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why do you do it?&rdquo; asked Flora. &ldquo;I heard you only on Sunday
      declaiming about Fanny Anderson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; cried out all at once. &ldquo;There goes Flora.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked intensely serious and innocent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;It is the very reason I want the rule to be made,
      just to stop us, for I am sure we must often say more than is right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Especially when we come to the pass of declaring that the ninth
      commandment cannot be broken in regard to them,&rdquo; observed the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most likely they are saying much the same of us,&rdquo; said Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or worse,&rdquo; rejoined Dr. May. &ldquo;The injured never hates as much as the
      injurer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now papa has said the severest thing of all!&rdquo; whispered Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Proving the inexpedience of personalities,&rdquo; said Dr. May, &ldquo;and in good
      time enter the evening post.&mdash;Why! how now, Mr. May, are you gone
      mad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo! why ho! ha! hurrah!&rdquo; and up went Harry&rsquo;s book of decimals to the
      ceiling, coming down upon a candle, which would have been overturned on
      Ethel&rsquo;s work, if it had not been dexterously caught by Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harry!&rdquo; indignantly cried Ethel and Flora, &ldquo;see what you have done;&rdquo; and
      the doctor&rsquo;s voice called to order, but Harry could not heed. &ldquo;Hear! hear!
      he has a fortune, an estate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? Tell us&mdash;don&rsquo;t be so absurd. Who?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who, Mr. Ernescliffe. Here is a letter from Hector. Only listen:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Did you know we had an old far-away English cousin, one Mr. Halliday? I
      hardly did, though Alan was named after him, and he belonged to my mother.
      He was a cross old fellow, and took no notice of us, but within the last
      year or two, his nephew, or son, or something, died, and now he is just
      dead, and the lawyer wrote to tell Alan he is heir-at-law. Mr. Ernescliffe
      of Maplewood! Does it not sound well? It is a beautiful great place in
      Shropshire, and Alan and I mean to run off to see it as soon as he can
      have any time on shore.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel could not help looking at Margaret, but was ashamed of her
      impertinence, and coloured violently, whereas her sister did not colour at
      all, and Norman, looking down, wondered whether Alan would make the
      voyage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, of course he will; he must!&rdquo; said Harry. &ldquo;He would never give up
      now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norman further wondered whether Hector would remain on the Stoneborough
      foundation, and Mary hoped they should not lose him; but there was no
      great readiness to talk over the event, and there soon was a silence
      broken by Flora saying, &ldquo;He is no such nobody, as Louisa Anderson said,
      when we&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another shout, which caused Flora to take refuge in playing waltzes for
      the rest of the evening. Moreover, to the extreme satisfaction of Mary,
      she left her crochet-needle on the floor at night. While a tumultuous
      party were pursuing her with it to claim the penny, and Richard was
      conveying Margaret upstairs, Ethel found an opportunity of asking her
      father if he were not very glad of Mr. Ernescliffe&rsquo;s good fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, very. He is a good fellow, and will make a good use of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, papa, does it not make&mdash;You won&rsquo;t say now you are sorry he
      came here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had no answer but a sigh, and a look that made her blush for having
      ventured so far. She was so much persuaded that great events must ensue,
      that, all the next day, she listened to every ring of the bell, and when
      one at last was followed by a light, though, to her ears, manly sounding
      tread, she looked up flushing with expectation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behold, she was disappointed. &ldquo;Miss Walkingham&rdquo; was announced, and she
      rose surprised, for the lady in question had only come to Stoneborough for
      a couple of days with an infirm mother, who, having known Dr. May in old
      times, had made it her especial request that he would let her see his
      daughters. She was to proceed on her journey to-day, and the return of the
      visit had been by no means expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora went forward to receive her, wondering to see her so young looking,
      and so unformed. She held out her hand, with a red wrist, and, as far as
      could be seen under her veil, coloured when presented to the recumbent
      Margaret. How she got into her chair, they hardly knew, for Flora was at
      that moment extremely annoyed by hearing an ill-bred peal of Mary&rsquo;s
      laughter in the garden, close to the window; but she thought it best to
      appear unconscious, since she had no power to stop it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret thought the stranger embarrassed, and kindly inquired for Lady
      Walkingham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much the same, thank you,&rdquo; mumbled a voice down in the throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      A silence, until Margaret tried another question, equally briefly
      answered; and, after a short interval, the young lady contrived to make
      her exit, with the same amount of gaucherie as had marked her entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Expressions of surprise at once began, and were so loud, that when Harry
      entered the room, his inquiry was, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the row?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Walkingham,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;but you won&rsquo;t understand. She seemed half
      wild! Worse than me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you like the pretty improving manners?&rdquo; asked Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Manners! she had none,&rdquo; said Flora. &ldquo;She, highly connected! used to the
      best society!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know what the best society do?&rdquo; asked Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The poor thing seemed very shy,&rdquo; said Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about shyness,&rdquo; said Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was stifling a laugh all the time, like a rude schoolboy. And I
      thought papa said she was pretty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay? Did you think her so?&rdquo; asked Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A great broad red face&mdash;and so awkward!&rdquo; cried Flora indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If one could have seen her face, I think she might have been
      nice-looking,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;She had pretty golden curls, and merry blue
      eyes, rather like Harry&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Umph!&rdquo; said Flora; &ldquo;beauty and manners seemed to me much on a par. This
      is one of papa&rsquo;s swans, indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe it was Miss Walkingham at all,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;It must have
      been some boy in disguise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; cried Margaret, starting with the painful timidity of
      helplessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do look whether anything is gone. Where&rsquo;s the silver inkstand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think she could put that into her pocket,&rdquo; said Ethel, laughing
      as she held it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Do, Harry, see if the umbrellas are safe in the hall. I
      wish you would, for now I come to remember, the Walkinghams went at nine
      this morning. Miss Winter said that she saw the old lady helped into the
      carriage, as she passed.&rdquo; Margaret&rsquo;s eyes looked quite large and
      terrified. &ldquo;She must have been a spy&mdash;the whole gang will come at
      night. I wish Richard was here. Harry, it really is no laughing matter.
      You had better give notice to the police.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The more Margaret was alarmed, the more Harry laughed. &ldquo;Never mind,
      Margaret, I&rsquo;ll take care of you! Here&rsquo;s my dirk. I&rsquo;ll stick all the
      robbers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harry! Harry! Oh, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; cried Margaret, raising herself up in an agony
      of nervous terror. &ldquo;Oh, where is papa? Will nobody ring the bell, and send
      George for the police?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Police, police! Thieves! Murder! Robbers! Fire! All hands ahoy!&rdquo; shouted
      Harry, his hands making a trumpet over his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harry, how can you?&rdquo; said Ethel, hastily; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you see that Margaret is
      terribly frightened. Can&rsquo;t you say at once that it was you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You!&rdquo; and Margaret sank back, as there was a general outcry of laughter
      and wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you know it, Ethel?&rdquo; asked Flora severely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only guessed at this moment,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;How well you did it, Harry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said Flora, &ldquo;I did think her dress very like Margaret&rsquo;s shot silk.
      I hope you did not do that any harm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how did you manage?&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;Where did your bonnet come from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a new one of Adams&rsquo;s wife. Mary got it for me. Come in, Polly,
      they have found it out. Did you not hear her splitting with laughing
      outside the window? I would not let her come in for fear she should spoil
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I was just going to give her such a scolding for giggling in the
      garden,&rdquo; said Flora, &ldquo;and to say we had been as bad as Miss Walkingham.
      You should not have been so awkward, Harry; you nearly betrayed yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had nobody to teach him but Mary,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you should have seen me at my ease in Minster Street. No one
      suspected me there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Minster Street. Oh, Harry, you don&rsquo;t really mean it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do. That was what I did it for. I was resolved to know what the
      nameless ones said of the Misses May.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hasty and eager inquiries broke out from Flora and Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Dr. May was very clever, certainly, very clever. Had I seen the
      daughters? I said I was going to call there, and they said&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, oh, what, Harry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They said Flora was thought pretty, but&mdash;and as to Ethel, now, how
      do you think you came off, Unready?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me. They could not say the same of me, at any rate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite the reverse! They called Ethel very odd, poor girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;They may say what they please of me; besides
      that, I believe it is all Harry&rsquo;s own invention.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, that is a libel on my invention!&rdquo; exclaimed Harry. &ldquo;If I had drawn
      on that, could I not have told you something much droller?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And was that really all?&rdquo; said Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They said&mdash;let me see&mdash;that all our noses were too long, and,
      that as to Flora&rsquo;s being a beauty! when their brothers called her&mdash;so
      droll of them&mdash;but Harvey called her a stuck-up duchess. In fact, it
      was the fashion to make a great deal of those Mays.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope they said something of the sailor brother,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I found if I stayed to hear much more, I should be knocking Ned down,
      so I thought it time to take leave before he suspected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All this had passed very quickly, with much laughter, and numerous
      interjections of amusement, and reprobation, or delight. So excited were
      the young people, that they did not perceive a step on the gravel, till
      Dr. May entered by the window, and stood among them. His first exclamation
      was of consternation. &ldquo;Margaret, my dear child, what is the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Only then did her brother and sisters perceive that Margaret was lying
      back on her cushions, very pale, and panting for breath. She tried to
      smile and say, &ldquo;it was nothing,&rdquo; and &ldquo;she was silly,&rdquo; but the words were
      faint, from the palpitation of her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was Harry&rsquo;s trick,&rdquo; said Flora indignantly, as she flew for the
      scent-bottle, while her father bent over Margaret. &ldquo;Harry dressed himself
      up, and she was frightened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no&mdash;no&mdash;he did not mean it,&rdquo; gasped Margaret; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harry, I did not think you could be so cowardly and unfeeling!&rdquo; and Dr.
      May&rsquo;s look was even more reproachful than his words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry was dismayed at his sister&rsquo;s condition, but the injustice of the
      wholesale reproach chased away contrition. &ldquo;I did nothing to frighten any
      one,&rdquo; he said moodily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Harry, you know how you kept on,&rdquo; said Flora, &ldquo;and when you saw she
      was frightened&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can have no more of this,&rdquo; said Dr. May, seeing that the discussion was
      injuring Margaret more and more. &ldquo;Go away to my study, sir, and wait till
      I come to you. All of you out of the room. Flora, fetch the sal volatile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me tell you,&rdquo; whispered Margaret. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be angry with Harry. It was&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not now, not now, my dear. Lie quite still.&rdquo; She obeyed, took the sal
      volatile, and shut her eyes, while he sat leaning anxiously over, watching
      her. Presently she opened them, and, looking up, said rather faintly, and
      trying to smile, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I can be better till you have heard the
      rights of it. He did not mean it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys never do mean it,&rdquo; was the doctor&rsquo;s answer. &ldquo;I hoped better things
      of Harry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had no intention&mdash;&rdquo; began Margaret, but she still was unfit to
      talk, and her father silenced her, by promising to go and hear the boy&rsquo;s
      own account.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the hall, he was instantly beset by Ethel and Mary, the former
      exclaiming, &ldquo;Papa, you are quite mistaken! It was very foolish of Margaret
      to be so frightened. He did nothing at all to frighten any one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel&rsquo;s mode of pleading was unfortunate; the &ldquo;very foolish of Margaret&rdquo;
       were the very words to displease.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not interfere!&rdquo; said her father sternly. &ldquo;You only encourage him in
      his wanton mischief, and no one takes any heed how he torments my poor
      Margaret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa,&rdquo; cried Harry, passionately bursting open the study door,
      &ldquo;tormenting Margaret was the last thing I would do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not the way to speak, Harry. What have you been doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With rapid agitated utterance, Harry made his confession. At another time
      the doctor would have treated the matter as a joke carried too far, but
      which, while it called for censure, was very amusing; but now the
      explanation that the disguise had been assumed to impose on the Andersons,
      only added to his displeasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to think you have a licence to play off any impertinent freaks
      you please, without consideration for any one,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but I tell you
      it is not so. As long as you are under my roof, you shall feel my
      authority, and you shall spend the rest of the day in your room. I hope
      quietness there will bring you to a better mind, but I am disappointed in
      you. A boy who can choose such a time, and such subjects, for insolent,
      unfeeling, practical jokes, cannot be in a fit state for Confirmation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, papa! papa!&rdquo; cried the two girls, in tones of entreaty&mdash;while
      Harry, with a burning face and hasty step, dashed upstairs without a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been as bad!&rdquo; said Dr. May. &ldquo;I say nothing to you, Mary, you
      knew no better; but, to see you, Ethel, first encouraging him in his
      impertinence, and terrifying Margaret so, that I dare say she may be a
      week getting over it, and now defending him, and calling her silly, is
      unbearable. I cannot trust one of you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only listen, papa!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will have no altercation; I must go back to Margaret, since no one else
      has the slightest consideration for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An hour had passed away, when Richard knocked at Ethel&rsquo;s door to tell her
      that tea was ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a great mind not to go down,&rdquo; said Ethel, as he looked in, and saw
      her seated with a book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot bear to go down while poor Harry is so unjustly used.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, Ethel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot hush. Just because Margaret fancies robbers and murderers, and
      all sorts of nonsense, as she always did, is poor Harry to be accused of
      wantonly terrifying her, and shut up, and cut off from Confirmation? and
      just when he is going away, too! It is unkind, and unjust, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ethel, you will be sorry&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa will be sorry,&rdquo; continued Ethel, disregarding the caution. &ldquo;It is
      very unfair, that I will say so. It was all nonsense of Margaret&rsquo;s, but he
      will always make everything give way to her. And poor Harry just going to
      sea! No, Ritchie, I cannot come down; I cannot behave as usual.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will grieve Margaret much more,&rdquo; said Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help that&mdash;she should not have made such a fuss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard was somewhat in difficulties how to answer, but at that moment
      Harry&rsquo;s door, which was next, was slightly opened, and his voice said, &ldquo;Go
      down, Ethel. The captain may punish any one he pleases, and it is mutiny
      in the rest of the crew to take his part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harry is in the right,&rdquo; said Richard. &ldquo;It is our duty not to question our
      father&rsquo;s judgments. It would be wrong of you to stay up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wrong?&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. It would be against the articles of war,&rdquo; said Harry, opening
      his door another inch. &ldquo;But, Ritchie, I say, do tell me whether it has
      hurt Margaret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is better now,&rdquo; said Richard, &ldquo;but she has a headache, chiefly, I
      believe, from distress at having brought this on you. She is very sorry
      for her fright.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had not the least intention of frightening the most fearsome little
      tender mouse on earth,&rdquo; said Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed!&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And at another time it would not have signified,&rdquo; said Richard; &ldquo;but, you
      know, Margaret always was timid, and now, the not being able to move, and
      the being out of health, has made her nerves weak, so that she cannot help
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fault was in our never heeding her when we were so eager to hear
      Harry&rsquo;s story,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;That was what made the palpitation so bad.
      But, now papa knows all, does he not understand about Harry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was obliged to go out as soon as Margaret was better,&rdquo; said Richard,
      &ldquo;and was scarcely come in when I came up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go down, Ethel,&rdquo; repeated Harry. &ldquo;Never mind me. Norman told me that sort
      of joke never answered, and I might have minded him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The voice was very much troubled, and it brought back that burning
      sensation of indignant tears to Ethel&rsquo;s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Harry! you did not deserve to be so punished for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what you are not to say,&rdquo; returned Harry. &ldquo;I ought not to have
      played the trick, and&mdash;and just now too&mdash;but I always forget
      things&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door shut, and they fancied they heard sobs. Ethel groaned, but made
      no opposition to following her brother down to tea. Margaret lay, wan and
      exhausted, on the sofa&mdash;the doctor looked very melancholy and rather
      stern, and the others were silent. Ethel had begun to hope for the warm
      reaction she had so often known after a hasty fit, but it did not readily
      come; Harry was boy instead of girl&mdash;the fault and its consequence
      had been more serious&mdash;and the anxiety for the future was greater.
      Besides, he had not fully heard the story; Harry, in his incoherent
      narration, had not excused himself, and Margaret&rsquo;s panic had appeared more
      as if inspired by him, than, as it was, in fact, the work of her fancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the evening passed gloomily away, and it was not till the others had
      said good-night that Dr. May began to talk over the affair with his eldest
      son, who then was able to lay before him the facts of the case, as
      gathered from his sisters. He listened with a manner as though it were a
      reproof, and then said sadly, &ldquo;I am afraid I was in a passion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was very wrong in Harry,&rdquo; said Richard, &ldquo;and particularly unlucky it
      should happen with the Andersons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very thoughtless,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;no more, even as regarded Margaret;
      but thoughtlessness should not have been treated as a crime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish we could see him otherwise,&rdquo; said Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wants&mdash;&rdquo; and there Dr. May stopped short, and, taking up his
      candle, slowly mounted the stairs, and looked into Harry&rsquo;s room. The boy
      was in bed, but started up on hearing his father&rsquo;s step, and exclaimed,
      &ldquo;Papa, I am very sorry! Is Margaret better?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she is; and I understand now, Harry, that her alarm was an accident.
      I beg your pardon for thinking for a moment that it was otherwise&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; interrupted Harry, &ldquo;of course I could never mean to frighten her;
      but I did not leave off the moment I saw she was afraid, because it was so
      very ridiculous, and I did not guess it would hurt her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see, my honest boy. I do not blame you, for you did not know how much
      harm a little terror does to a person in her helpless state. But, indeed,
      Harry, though you did not deserve such anger as mine was, it is a serious
      thing that you should be so much set on fun and frolic as to forget all
      considerations, especially at such a time as this. It takes away from much
      of my comfort in sending you into the world; and for higher things&mdash;how
      can I believe you really impressed and reverent, if the next minute&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not fit! I&rsquo;m not fit!&rdquo; sobbed Harry, hiding his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, I hardly know whether it is not so,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;You are
      under the usual age, and, though I know you wish to be a good boy, yet I
      don&rsquo;t feel sure that these wild spirits do not carry away everything
      serious, and whether it is right to bring one so thoughtless to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; and Harry cried bitterly, and his father was deeply grieved; but
      no more could then be said, and they parted for the night&mdash;Dr. May
      saying, as he went away, &ldquo;You understand, that it is not as punishment for
      your trick, if I do not take you to Mr. Ramsden for a ticket, but that I
      cannot be certain whether it is right to bring you to such solemn
      privileges while you do not seem to me to retain steadily any grave or
      deep feelings. Perhaps your mother would have better helped you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Dr. May went away to mourn over what he viewed as far greater sins
      than those of his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anger had, indeed, given place to sorrow, and all were grave the next
      morning, as if each had something to be forgiven.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret, especially, felt guilty of the fears which, perhaps, had not
      been sufficiently combated in her days of health, and now were beyond
      control, and had occasioned so much pain. Ethel grieved over the words she
      had yesterday spoken in haste of her father and sister; Mary knew herself
      to have been an accomplice in the joke; and Norman blamed himself for not
      having taken the trouble to perceive that Harry had not been talking
      rhodomontade, when he had communicated &ldquo;his capital scheme&rdquo; the previous
      morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The decision as to the Confirmation was a great grief to all. Flora
      consoled herself by observing that, as he was so young, no one need know
      it, nor miss him; and Ethel, with a trembling, almost sobbing voice,
      enumerated all Harry&rsquo;s excellences, his perfect truth, his kindness, his
      generosity, his flashes of intense feeling&mdash;declared that nobody
      might be confirmed if he were not, and begged and entreated that Mr.
      Wilmot might be written to, and consulted. She would almost have done so
      herself, if Richard had not shown her it would be undutiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry himself was really subdued. He made no question as to the propriety
      of the decision, but rather felt his own unworthiness, and was completely
      humbled and downcast. When a note came from Mrs. Anderson, saying that she
      was convinced that it could not have been Dr. May&rsquo;s wish that she should
      be exposed to the indignity of a practical joke, and that a young lady of
      the highest family should have been insulted, no one had spirits to laugh
      at the terms; and when Dr. May said, &ldquo;What is to be done?&rdquo; Harry turned
      crimson, and was evidently trying to utter something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see nothing for it but for him to ask their pardon,&rdquo; said Dr. May; and
      a sound was heard, not very articulate, but expressing full assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is right,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, thank you!&rdquo; cried Harry, looking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      They set off at once. Mrs. Anderson was neither an unpleasing nor unkind
      person&mdash;her chief defect being a blind admiration of her sons and
      daughters, which gave her, in speaking of them, a tone of pretension that
      she would never have shown on her own account.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her displeasure was pacified in a moment by the sight of the confused
      contrition of the culprit, coupled with his father&rsquo;s frank and kindly tone
      of avowal, that it had been a foolish improper frolic, and that he had
      been much displeased with him for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say no more&mdash;pray, say no more, Dr. May. We all know how to overlook
      a sailor&rsquo;s frolic, and, I am sure, Master Harry&rsquo;s present behaviour; but
      you&rsquo;ll take a bit of luncheon,&rdquo; and, as something was said of going home
      to the early dinner, &ldquo;I am sure you will wait one minute. Master Harry
      must have a piece of my cake, and allow me to drink to his success.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor Mr. May! to be called Master Harry, and treated to sweet cake! But he
      saw his father thought he ought to endure, and he even said, &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cake stuck in his throat, however, when Mrs. Anderson and her
      daughters opened their full course of praise on their dear Harvey and
      dearest Edward, telling all the flattering things Dr. Hoxton had said of
      the order into which Harvey had brought the school, and insisting on Dr.
      May&rsquo;s reading the copy of the testimonial that he had carried to Oxford.
      &ldquo;I knew you would be kind enough to rejoice,&rdquo; said Mrs. Anderson, &ldquo;and
      that you would have no&mdash;no feeling about Mr. Norman; for, of course,
      at his age, a little matter is nothing, and it must be better for the dear
      boy himself to be a little while under a friend like Harvey, than to have
      authority while so young.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe it has done him no harm,&rdquo; was all that the doctor could bring
      himself to say; and thinking that he and his son had endured quite enough,
      he took his leave as soon as Harry had convulsively bolted the last
      mouthful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a word was spoken all the way home. Harry&rsquo;s own trouble had
      overpowered even this subject of resentment. On Sunday, the notice of the
      Confirmation was read. It was to take place on the following Thursday, and
      all those who had already given in their names were to come to Mr. Ramsden
      to apply for their tickets. While this was read, large tear-drops were
      silently falling on poor Harry&rsquo;s book.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel and Norman walked together in the twilight, in deep lamentation over
      their brother&rsquo;s deprivation, which seemed especially to humble them;
      &ldquo;for,&rdquo; said Norman, &ldquo;I am sure no one can be more resolved on doing right
      than July, and he has got through school better than I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ethel; &ldquo;if we don&rsquo;t get into his sort of scrape, it is only
      that we are older, not better. I am sure mine are worse, my letting Aubrey
      be nearly burned&mdash;my neglects.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa must be doing right,&rdquo; said Norman, &ldquo;but for July to be turned back
      when we are taken, makes me think of man judging only by outward
      appearance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A few outrageous-looking acts of giddiness that are so much grieved over,
      may not be half so bad as the hundreds of wandering thoughts that one
      forgets, because no one else can see them!&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Harry and Mary were sitting twisted together into a sort of
      bundle, on the same footstool, by Margaret&rsquo;s sofa. Harry had begged of her
      to hear him say the Catechism once more, and Mary had joined with him in
      the repetition. There was to be only one more Sunday at home. &ldquo;And that!&rdquo;
       he said, and sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret knew what he meant, for the Feast was to be spread for those
      newly admitted to share it. She only said a caressing word of affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder when I shall have another chance,&rdquo; said Harry. &ldquo;If we should get
      to Australia, or New Zealand&mdash;but then, perhaps, there would be no
      Confirmation going on, and I might be worse by that time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you must not let that be!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you see, if I can&rsquo;t be good here, with all this going on, what shall
      I do among those fellows, away from all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will have one friend!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Ernescliffe! You are always thinking of him, Margaret; but perhaps he
      may not go, and if he should, a lieutenant cannot do much for a
      midshipman. No, I thought, when I was reading with my father, that somehow
      it might help me to do what it called putting away childish things&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      you know? I might be able to be stronger and steadier, somehow. And then,
      if&mdash;if&mdash;you know, if I did tumble overboard, or anything of that
      sort, there is that about the&mdash;what they will go to next Sunday,
      being necessary to salvation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harry laid down his head and cried; Margaret could not speak for tears;
      and Mary was incoherently protesting against any notion of his falling
      overboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is generally necessary, Harry,&rdquo; Margaret said at last&mdash;&ldquo;not in
      impossible cases.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes if it had been impossible, but it was not; if I had not been a mad
      goose all this time, but when a bit of fun gets hold of me, I can&rsquo;t think.
      And if I am too bad for that, I am too bad for&mdash;for&mdash;and I shall
      never see mamma again! Margaret, it almost makes me af&mdash;afraid to
      sail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harry, don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t talk so!&rdquo; sobbed Mary. &ldquo;Oh, do come to papa, and let
      us beg and pray. Take hold of my hand, and Margaret will beg too, and when
      he sees how sorry you are, I am sure he will forgive, and let you be
      confirmed.&rdquo; She would have dragged him after her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Mary,&rdquo; said Harry, resisting her. &ldquo;It is not that he does not
      forgive. You don&rsquo;t understand. It is what is right. And he cannot help it,
      or make it right for me, if I am such a horrid wretch that I can&rsquo;t keep
      grave thoughts in my head. I might do it again after that, just the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been grave enough of late,&rdquo; said Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This was enough to make me so,&rdquo; said Harry; &ldquo;but even at church, since I
      came home, I have behaved ill! I kicked Tom, to make him look at old
      Levitt asleep, and then I went on, because he did not like it. I know I am
      too idle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the Tuesday, Dr. May had said he would take Norman and Etheldred to Mr.
      Ramsden. Ethel was gravely putting on her walking dress, when she heard
      her father&rsquo;s voice calling Harry, and she started with a joyful hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      There, indeed, when she came downstairs, stood Harry, his cap in his hand,
      and his face serious, but with a look on it that had as much subdued joy
      as awe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear, dear Harry! you are going with us then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, papa wrote to ask what Mr. Wilmot thought, and he said&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harry broke off as his father advanced, and gave her the letter itself to
      read. Mr. Wilmot answered that he certainly should not refuse such a boy
      as Harry, on the proof of such entire penitence and deep feeling. Whether
      to bring him to the further privilege might be another question; but, as
      far as the Confirmation was concerned, the opinion was decided.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norman and Ethel were too happy for words, as they went arm in arm along
      the street, leaving their dear sailor to be leaned on by his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry&rsquo;s sadness was gone, but he still was guarded and gentle during the
      few days that followed; he seemed to have learned thought, and in his
      gratitude for the privileges he had so nearly missed, to rate them more
      highly than he might otherwise have done. Indeed, the doubt for the Sunday
      gave him a sense of probation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Confirmation day came. Mr. Rivers had asked that his daughter might be
      with Miss May, and Ethel had therefore to be called for in the Abbotstoke
      carriage, quite contrary to her wishes, as she had set her heart on the
      walk to church with her father and brothers. Flora would not come, for
      fear of crowding Mr. Rivers, who, with Mrs. Larpent, accompanied his
      darling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Margaret,&rdquo; said Flora, after putting her sister into the carriage, &ldquo;I
      wish we had put Ethel into a veil! There is Meta all white from head to
      foot, with such a veil! and Ethel, in her little white cap, looks as if
      she might be Lucy Taylor, only not so pretty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma thought the best rule was to take the dress that needs least
      attention from ourselves, and will be least noticed,&rdquo; said Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is Fanny Anderson gone by in the fly with a white veil on!&rdquo; cried
      Mary, dashing in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I am glad Ethel has not one,&rdquo; said Flora. Margaret looked annoyed,
      but she had not found the means of checking Flora without giving offence;
      and she could only call Mary and Blanche to order, beg them to think of
      what the others were doing, and offer to read to them a little tale on
      Confirmation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora sat and worked, and Margaret, stealing a glance at her, understood
      that, in her quiet way, she resented the implied reproof. &ldquo;Making the
      children think me worldly and frivolous!&rdquo; she thought; &ldquo;as if Margaret did
      not know that I think and feel as much as any reasonable person!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The party came home in due time, and after one kiss to Margaret, given in
      silence, dispersed, for they could not yet talk of what had passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only Ethel, as she met Richard on the stairs, said, &ldquo;Ritchie, do you know
      what the bishop&rsquo;s text was? &lsquo;No man having put his hand to the plough, and
      looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; said Richard interrogatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought it might be a voice to me,&rdquo; said Ethel; &ldquo;besides what it says
      to all, about our Christian course. It seems to tell me not to be out of
      heart about all those vexations at Cocksmoor. Is it not a sort of putting
      our hand to the plough?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. May gave his own history of the Confirmation to Margaret. &ldquo;It was a
      beautiful thing to watch,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the faces of our own set. Those four
      were really like a poem. There was little Meta in her snowy whiteness,
      looking like innocence itself, hardly knowing of evil, or pain, or
      struggle, as that soft earnest voice made her vow to be ready for it all,
      almost as unscathed and unconscious of trial, as when they made it for her
      at her baptism; pretty little thing&mdash;may she long be as happy. And
      for our own Ethel, she looked as if she was promising on and on, straight
      into eternity. I heard her &lsquo;I do,&rsquo; dear child, and it was in such a tone
      as if she meant to be ever doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And for the boys?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was Norman grave and steadfast, as if he knew what he was about,
      and was manfully and calmly ready&mdash;he might have been a young knight,
      watching his armour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so he is,&rdquo; said Margaret softly. &ldquo;And poor Harry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor could hardly command voice to tell her. &ldquo;Poor Harry, he was
      last of all, he turned his back and looked into the corner of the seat,
      till all the voices had spoken, and then turned about in haste, and the
      two words came on the end of a sob.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not keep him away on Sunday?&rdquo; said Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Far be it from me. I know not who should come, if he should not.&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER XXVI.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     What matter, whether through delight,
       Or led through vale of tears,
     Or seen at once, or hid from sight,
       The glorious way appears?
     If step by step the path we see,
       That leads, my Saviour, up to Thee!
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not help it,&rdquo; said Dr. May; &ldquo;that little witch&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meta Rivers? Oh! what, papa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems that Wednesday is her birthday, and nothing will serve her but
      to eat her dinner in the old Roman camp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And are we to go? Oh, which of us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every one of anything like rational years. Blanche is especially
      invited.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There were transports till it was recollected that on Thursday morning
      school would recommence, and that on Friday Harry must join his ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the Roman camp had long been an object of their desires, and
      Margaret was glad that the last day should have a brilliancy, so she would
      not hear of any one remaining to keep her company, talked of the profit
      she should gain by a leisure day, and took ardent interest in every one&rsquo;s
      preparations and expectations, in Ethel&rsquo;s researches into county histories
      and classical dictionaries, Flora&rsquo;s sketching intentions, Norman&rsquo;s
      promises of campanula glomerata, and a secret whispered into her ear by
      Mary and Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meta&rsquo;s weather,&rdquo; as they said, when the August sun rose fresh and joyous;
      and great was the unnecessary bustle, and happy confusion from six o&rsquo;clock
      till eleven, when Dr. May, who was going to visit patients some way
      farther on the same road, carried off Harry and Mary, to set them down at
      the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest were called for by Mr. Rivers&rsquo;s carriage and brake. Mrs. Charles
      Wilmot and her little girl were the only additions to the party, and Meta,
      putting Blanche into the carriage to keep company with her contemporary,
      went herself in the brake. What a brilliant little fairy she was, in her
      pink summer robes, fluttering like a butterfly, and with the same apparent
      felicity in basking in joy, all gaiety, glee, and light-heartedness in
      making others happy. On they went, through honeysuckled lanes, catching
      glimpses of sunny fields of corn falling before the reaper, and happy
      knots of harvest folks dining beneath the shelter of their sheaves, with
      the sturdy old green umbrella sheltering them from the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Snatches of song, peals of laughter, merry nonsense, passed from one to
      the other; Norman, roused into blitheness, found wit, the young ladies
      found laughter, and Richard&rsquo;s eyes and mouth looked very pretty, as they
      smiled their quiet diversion.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, his face drawn all into one silent laugh, he directed the eyes of
      the rest to a high green mound, rising immediately before them, where
      stood two little figures, one with a spy-glass, intently gazing the
      opposite way.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time came the halt, and Norman, bounding out, sprang lightly
      and nimbly up the side of the mound, and, while the spy-glass was yet
      pointed full at Wales, had hold of a pair of stout legs, and with the
      words, &ldquo;Keep a good lockout!&rdquo; had tumbled Mr. May headforemost down the
      grassy slope, with Mary rolling after.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry&rsquo;s first outcry was for his precious glass&mdash;his second was, not
      at his fall, but that they should have come from the east, when, by the
      compass, Stoneborough was north-north-west. And then the boys took to
      tumbling over one another, while Meta frolicked joyously, with Nipen after
      her, up and down the mounds, chased by Mary and Blanche, who were wild
      with glee.
    </p>
    <p>
      By-and-by she joined Ethel, and Norman was summoned to help them to trace
      out the old lines of encampment, ditch, rampart, and gates&mdash;happy
      work on those slopes of fresh turf, embroidered with every minute blossom
      of the moor&mdash;thyme, birdsfoot, eyebright, and dwarf purple thistle,
      buzzed and hummed over by busy, black-tailed, yellow-banded dumbledores,
      the breezy wind blowing softly in their faces, and the expanse of country&mdash;wooded
      hill, verdant pasture, amber harvest-field, winding river, smoke-canopied
      town, and brown moor, melting grayly away to the mountain heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now in sun, now in shade, the bright young antiquaries surveyed the old
      banks, and talked wisely of vallum and fossa, of legion and cohort, of
      Agricola and Suetonius, and discussed the delightful probability, that
      this might have been raised in the war with Caractacus, whence, argued
      Ethel, since Caractacus was certainly Arviragus, it must have been the
      very spot where Imogen met Posthumus again. Was not yonder the very
      high-road to Milford Haven, and thus must not &ldquo;fair Fidele&rsquo;s grassy tomb&rdquo;
       be in the immediate neighbourhood?
    </p>
    <p>
      Then followed the suggestion that the mound in the middle was a good deal
      like an ancient tomb, where, as Blanche interposed with some of the lore
      lately caught from Ethel&rsquo;s studies, &ldquo;they used to bury their tears in
      wheelbarrows,&rdquo; while Norman observed it was the more probable, as fair
      Fidele never was buried at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea of a search enchanted the young ladies. &ldquo;It was the right sort of
      vehicle, evidently,&rdquo; said Norman, looking at Harry, who had been
      particularly earnest in recommending that it should be explored; and Meta
      declared that if they could but find the least trace, her papa would be
      delighted to go regularly to work, and reveal all the treasures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard seemed a little afraid of the responsibility of treasure-trove,
      but he was overruled by a chorus of eager voices, and dispossessed of the
      trowel, which he had brought to dig up some down-gentians for the garden.
      While Norman set to work as pioneer, some skipped about in wild ecstasy,
      and Ethel knelt down to peer into the hole.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very soon there was a discovery&mdash;an eager outcry&mdash;some pottery!
      Roman vessels&mdash;a red thing that might have been a lamp, another that
      might have been a lachrymatory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;you know, Norman, I always told you that the
      children&rsquo;s pots and pans in the clay ditch were very like Roman pottery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Posthumus&rsquo;s patty pan!&rdquo; said Norman, holding it up. &ldquo;No doubt this was
      the bottle filled with the old queen&rsquo;s tears when Cloten was killed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see it is very small,&rdquo; added Harry; &ldquo;she could not squeeze out many.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come now, I do believe you are laughing at it!&rdquo; said Meta, taking the
      derided vessels into her hands. &ldquo;Now, they really are genuine, and very
      curious things, are not they, Flora?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flora and Ethel admired and speculated till there was a fresh, and still
      more exciting discovery&mdash;a coin, actually a medal, with the head of
      an emperor upon it&mdash;not a doubt of his high nose being Roman. Meta
      was certain that she knew one exactly like him among her father&rsquo;s gems.
      Ethel was resolved that he should be Claudius, and began decyphering the
      defaced inscription THVRVS. She tried Claudius&rsquo;s whole torrent of names,
      and, at last, made it into a contraction of Tiberius, which highly
      satisfied her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Meta, in her turn, read D.V.X., which, as Ethel said, was all she
      could wish&mdash;of course it was dux et imperator, and Harry muttered
      into Norman&rsquo;s ear, &ldquo;ducks and geese!&rdquo; and then heaved a sigh, as he
      thought of the dux no longer. &ldquo;V.V.,&rdquo; continued Meta; &ldquo;what can that
      mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five, five, of course,&rdquo; said Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! I have it, Venus Victrix&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;the ancestral Venus! Ha!
      don&rsquo;t you see? there she is on the other side, crowning Claudius.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there is an E.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something about Aeneas,&rdquo; suggested Norman gravely. But Ethel was sure
      that could not be, because there was no diphthong; and a fresh theory was
      just being started, when Blanche&rsquo;s head was thrust in to know what made
      them all so busy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Ethel, what are you doing with Harry&rsquo;s old medal of the Duke of
      Wellington?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor Meta and Ethel, what a downfall! Meta was sure that Norman had known
      it the whole time, and he owned to having guessed it from Harry&rsquo;s
      importunity for the search. Harry and Mary had certainly made good use of
      their time, and great was the mirth over the trap so cleverly set&mdash;the
      more when it was disclosed that Dr. May had been a full participator in
      the scheme, had suggested the addition of the pottery, had helped Harry to
      some liquid to efface part of the inscription, and had even come up with
      them to plant the snare in the most plausible corner for researches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meta, enchanted with the joke, flew off to try to take in her governess
      and Mrs. Wilmot, whom she found completing their leisurely promenade, and
      considering where they should spread the dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sight of those great baskets of good fare was appetising, and the
      company soon collected on the shady turf, where Richard made himself
      extremely useful, and the feast was spread without any worse mishap than
      Nipen&rsquo;s running away with half a chicken, of which he was robbed, as Tom
      reported, by a surly-looking dog that watched in the outskirts of the
      camp, and caused Tom to return nearly as fast as the poor little white
      marauder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meta &ldquo;very immorally,&rdquo; as Norman told her, comforted Nipen with a large
      share of her sandwiches. Harry armed himself with a stick and Mary with a
      stone, and marched off to the attack, but saw no signs of the enemy, and
      had begun to believe him a figment of Tom&rsquo;s imagination, when Mary spied
      him under a bush, lying at the feet of a boy, with whom he was sharing the
      spoil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry called out rather roughly, &ldquo;Hallo! what are you doing there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy jumped up, the dog growled, Mary shrank behind her brother, and
      begged him not to be cross to the poor boy, but to come away. Harry
      repeated his question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please, sir, Toby brought it to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, is Toby your dog?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you so hungry as to eat dog&rsquo;s meat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not had nothing before to-day, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, where do you live? hereabouts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, sir; I lived with grandmother up in Cheshire, but she is dead
      now, and father is just come home from sea, and he wrote down I was to be
      sent to him at Portsmouth, to go to sea with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you live? do you beg your way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; father sent up a pound in a letter, only Nanny Brooks said I
      owed some to her for my victuals, and I have not much of it left, and
      bread comes dear, so when Toby brought me this bit of meat I was glad of
      it, sir, but I would not have taken it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy was desired to wait while the brother and sister, in breathless
      excitement, rushed back with their story.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wilmot was at first inclined to fear that the naval part of it had
      been inspired by Harry&rsquo;s uniform, but the examination of Jem Jennings put
      it beyond a doubt that he spoke nothing but the truth; and the choicest
      delight of the feast was the establishing him and Toby behind the barrow,
      and feeding them with such viands as they had probably never seen before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy could not read writing, but he had his father&rsquo;s letter in his
      pocket, and Mary capered at the delightful coincidence, on finding that
      Jem Jennings was actually a quarter-master on board the Alcestis. It gave
      a sort of property in the boy, and she almost grudged Meta the having been
      first to say that she would pay for the rest of his journey, instead of
      doing it by subscription.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, Mary had a consolation, she would offer to take charge of Toby,
      who, as Harry observed, would otherwise have been drowned&mdash;he could
      not be taken on board. To be sure, he was a particularly ugly animal,
      rough, grisly, short-legged, long-backed, and with an apology for a tail&mdash;but
      he had a redeeming pair of eyes, and he and Jem lived on terms of such
      close friendship, that he would have been miserable in leaving him to the
      mercy of Nanny Brooks.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, after their meal, Jem and Toby were bidden to wait for Dr. May&rsquo;s
      coming, and fell asleep together on the green bank, while the rest either
      sketched, or wandered, or botanised. Flora acted the grown-up lady with
      Mrs. Wilmot, and Meta found herself sitting by Ethel, asking her a great
      many questions about Margaret, and her home, and what it could be like to
      be one of such a numerous family. Flora had always turned aside from
      personal matters, as uninteresting to her companion, and, in spite of
      Meta&rsquo;s admiration, and the mutual wish to be intimate, confidence did not
      spring up spontaneously, as it had done with the doctor, and, in that
      single hour, with Margaret. Blunt as Ethel was, her heartiness of manner
      gave a sense of real progress in friendship. Their Confirmation vows
      seemed to make a link, and Meta&rsquo;s unfeigned enthusiasm for the doctor was
      the sure road to Ethel&rsquo;s heart. She was soon telling how glad Margaret was
      that he had been drawn into taking pleasure in to-day&rsquo;s scheme, since, not
      only were his spirits tried by the approach of Harry&rsquo;s departure, but he
      had, within the last few days, been made very sad by reading and answering
      Aunt Flora&rsquo;s first letter on the news of last October&rsquo;s misfortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My aunt in New Zealand,&rdquo; explained Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you an aunt in New Zealand?&rdquo; cried Meta. &ldquo;I never heard of her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did not you? Oh! she does write such charming long letters!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she Dr. May&rsquo;s sister?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; he was an only child. She is dear mamma&rsquo;s sister. I don&rsquo;t remember
      her, for she went out when I was a baby, but Richard and Margaret were so
      fond of her. They say she used to play with them, and tell them stories,
      and sing Scotch songs to them. Margaret says the first sorrow of her life
      was Aunt Flora&rsquo;s going away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she live with them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; after grandpapa died, she came to live with them, but then Mr.
      Arnott came about. I ought not to speak evil of him, for he is my
      godfather, but we do wish he had not carried off Aunt Flora! That letter
      of hers showed me what a comfort it would be to papa to have her here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps she will come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; Uncle Arnott has too much to do. It was a pretty story altogether. He
      was an officer at Edinburgh, and fell in love with Aunt Flora, but my
      grandfather Mackenzie thought him too poor to marry her, and it was all
      broken off, and they tried to think no more of it. But grandpapa died, and
      she came to live here, and somehow Mr. Arnott turned up again, quartered
      at Whitford, and papa talked over my Uncle Mackenzie, and helped them&mdash;and
      Mr. Arnott thought the best way would be to go out to the colonies. They
      went when New Zealand was very new, and a very funny life they had! Once
      they had their house burned in Heki&rsquo;s rebellion&mdash;and Aunt Flora saw a
      Maori walking about in her best Sunday bonnet; but, in general, everything
      has gone on very well, and he has a great farm, besides an office under
      government.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, so he went out as a settler! I was in hopes it was as a missionary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fancy Aunt Flora has done a good deal that may be called missionary
      work,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;teaching the Maori women and girls. They call her
      mother, and she has quite a doctor&rsquo;s shop for them, and tries hard to
      teach them to take proper care of their poor little children when they are
      ill; and she cuts out clothes for the whole pah, that is, the village.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And are they Christians?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! to be sure they are now! They meet in the pah for prayers every
      morning and evening&mdash;they used to have a hoe struck against a bit of
      metal for a signal, and when papa heard of it, he gave them a bell, and
      they were so delighted. Now there comes a clergyman every fourth Sunday,
      and, on the others, Uncle Arnott reads part of the service to the English
      near, and the Maori teacher to his people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meta asked ravenously for more details, and when she had pretty well
      exhausted Ethel&rsquo;s stock, she said, &ldquo;How nice it must be! Ethel, did you
      ever read the &lsquo;Faithful Little Girl?&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; it was one of Margaret&rsquo;s old Sunday books. I often recollected it
      before I was allowed to begin Cocksmoor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I am very like Lucilla!&rdquo; said Meta.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? In wishing to be a boy, that you might be a missionary?&rdquo; said
      Ethel. &ldquo;Not in being quite so cross at home?&rdquo; she added, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not cross, because I have no opportunity,&rdquo; said Meta.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No opportunity. Oh, Meta, if people wish to be cross, it is easy enough
      to find grounds for it. There is always the moon to cry for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really and truly,&rdquo; said Meta thoughtfully, &ldquo;I never do meet with any
      reasonable trial of temper, and I am often afraid it cannot be right or
      safe to live so entirely at ease, and without contradictions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;it is the state of life in which you are
      placed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but are we meant never to have vexations?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you had them,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;Margaret told me about your maid.
      That would have worried some people, and made them horridly cross.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no rational person,&rdquo; cried Meta. &ldquo;It was so nice to think of her
      being with the poor mother, and I was quite interested in managing for
      myself; besides, you know, it was just a proof how one learns to be
      selfish, that it had never occurred to me that I ought to spare her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your school children&mdash;you were in some trouble about them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that is pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you had a class you did not like?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like them now&mdash;they are such steady plodding girls, so much in
      earnest, and one, that has been neglected, is so pleased and touched by
      kindness. I would not give them up for anything now&mdash;they are just
      fit for my capacity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean that nothing ever goes wrong with you, or that you do not
      mind anything&mdash;which?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing goes wrong enough with me to give me a handsome excuse for
      minding it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it must be all your good temper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; said Meta; &ldquo;it is that nothing is ever disagreeable to
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;if the ill-temper was in you, you would only be the
      crosser for being indulged&mdash;at least, so books say. And I am sure
      myself that it is not whether things are disagreeable or not, but whether
      one&rsquo;s will is with them, that signifies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;I have seen the boys do for play, and done myself, what would
      have been a horrid hardship if one had been made to do it. I never liked
      any lessons as well as those I did without being obliged, and always, when
      there is a thing I hate very much in itself, I can get up an interest in
      it, by resolving that I will do it well, or fast, or something&mdash;if I
      can stick my will to it, it is like a lever, and it is done. Now, I think
      it must be the same with you, only your will is more easily set at it than
      mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes me uncomfortable is, that I feel as if I never followed
      anything but my will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel screwed up her face, as if the eyes of her mind were pursuing some
      thought almost beyond her. &ldquo;If our will and our duty run the same,&rdquo; she
      said, &ldquo;that can&rsquo;t be wrong. The better people are, the more they &lsquo;love
      what He commands,&rsquo; you know. In heaven they have no will but His.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! but Ethel,&rdquo; cried Meta, distressed, &ldquo;that is putting it too high.
      Won&rsquo;t you understand what I mean? We have learned so much lately about
      self-denial, and crossing one&rsquo;s own inclinations, and enduring hardness.
      And here I live with two dear kind people, who only try to keep every
      little annoyance from my path. I can&rsquo;t wish for a thing without getting it&mdash;I
      am waited on all day long, and I feel like one of the women that are at
      ease&mdash;one of the careless daughters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think still papa would say it was your happy contented temper that made
      you find no vexation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that sort of temper is not goodness. I was born with it; I never did
      mind anything, not even being punished, they say, unless I knew papa was
      grieved, which always did make me unhappy enough. I laughed, and went to
      play most saucily, whatever they did to me. If I had striven for the
      temper, it would be worth having, but it is my nature. And Ethel,&rdquo; she
      added, in a low voice, as the tears came into her eyes, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you
      remember last Sunday? I felt myself so vain and petted a thing! as if I
      had no share in the Cup of suffering, and did not deserve to call myself a
      member&mdash;it seemed ungrateful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel felt ashamed, as she heard of warmer feelings than her own had been,
      expressed in that lowered trembling voice, and she sought for the answer
      that would only come to her mind in sense, not at first in words.
      &ldquo;Discipline,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;would not that show the willingness to have the
      part? Taking the right times for refusing oneself some pleasant thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would not that be only making up something for oneself?&rdquo; said Meta.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, the Church orders it. It is in the Prayer-book,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;I mean
      one can do little secret things&mdash;not read storybooks on those days,
      or keep some tiresome sort of work for them. It is very trumpery, but it
      keeps the remembrance, and it is not so much as if one did not heed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll think,&rdquo; said Meta, sighing. &ldquo;If only I felt myself at work, not to
      please myself, but to be of use. Ha!&rdquo; she cried, springing up, &ldquo;I do
      believe I see Dr. May coming!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us run and meet him,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      They did so, and he called out his wishes of many happy returns of blithe
      days to the little birthday queen, then added, &ldquo;You both look grave,
      though&mdash;have they deserted you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, papa, we have been having a talk,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;May I tell him, Meta?
      I want to know what he says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meta had not bargained for this, but she was very much in earnest, and
      there was nothing formidable in Dr. May, so she assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meta is longing to be at work&mdash;she thinks she is of no use,&rdquo; said
      Ethel; &ldquo;she says she never does anything but please herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pleasing oneself is not the same as trying to please oneself,&rdquo; said Dr.
      May kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she thinks it cannot be safe or right,&rdquo; added Ethel, &ldquo;to live that
      happy bright life, as if people without care or trouble could not be
      living as Christians are meant to live. Is that it, Meta?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think it is,&rdquo; said Meta. &ldquo;I seem to be only put here to be made
      much of!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did David say, Meta?&rdquo; returned Dr. May.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
              &ldquo;My Shepherd is the living Lord,
                 Nothing therefore I need;
               In pastures fair, near pleasant streams,
                 He setteth me to feed.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you think,&rdquo; said Meta, much touched, &ldquo;that I ought to look on this
      as &lsquo;the pastures fair,&rsquo; and be thankful. I hope I was not unthankful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;It was the wish to bear hardness, and be a good
      soldier, was it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! my dear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the rugged path and dark valley will come in His
      own fit time. Depend upon it, the good Shepherd is giving you what is best
      for you in the green meadow, and if you lay hold on His rod and staff in
      your sunny days&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped short, and turned to his daughter.
      &ldquo;Ethel, they sang that psalm the first Sunday I brought your mamma home!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meta was much affected, and began to put together what the father and
      daughter had said. Perhaps the little modes of secret discipline, of which
      Ethel had spoken, might be the true means of clasping the staff&mdash;perhaps
      she had been impatient, and wanting in humility in craving for the strife,
      when her armour was scarce put on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. May spoke once again. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let any one long for external trial. The
      offering of a free heart is the thing. To offer praise is the great object
      of all creatures in heaven and earth. If the happier we are, the more we
      praise, then all is well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the serious discussion was suddenly broken off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Others had seen Dr. May&rsquo;s approach, and Harry and Mary rushed down in
      dismay at their story having, as they thought, been forestalled. However,
      they had it all to themselves, and the doctor took up the subject as
      keenly as could have been hoped, but the poor boy being still fast asleep,
      after, probably, much fatigue, he would not then waken him to examine him,
      but came and sat down in the semicircle, formed by a terraced bank of soft
      turf, where Mrs. Larpent, Mrs. Wilmot, Richard, and Flora, had for some
      time taken up their abode. Meta brought him the choice little basket of
      fruit which she had saved for him, and all delighted in having him there,
      evidently enjoying the rest and sport very much, as he reposed on the
      fragrant slope, eating grapes, and making inquiries as to the antiquities
      lately discovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norman gave an exceedingly droll account of the great Roman Emperor,
      Tiberius V.V., and Meta correcting it, there was a regular gay skirmish of
      words, which entertained every one extremely&mdash;above all, Meta&rsquo;s
      indignation when the charge was brought home to her of having declared the
      &ldquo;old Duke&rdquo; exactly like in turns to Domitian and Tiberius&mdash;his
      features quite forbidding.
    </p>
    <p>
      This lasted till the younger ones, who had been playing and rioting till
      they were tired, came up, and throwing themselves down on the grass,
      Blanche petitioned for something that every one could play at.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meta proposed what she called the story play. One was to be sent out of
      earshot, and the rest to agree upon a word, which was then to be guessed
      by each telling a story, and introducing the word into it, not too
      prominently. Meta volunteered to guess, and Harry whispered to Mary it
      would be no go, but, in the meantime, the word was found, and Blanche
      eagerly recalled Meta, and sat in the utmost expectation and delight. Meta
      turned first to Richard, but he coloured distressfully, and begged that
      Flora might tell his story for him&mdash;he should only spoil the game.
      Flora, with a little tinge of graceful reluctance, obeyed. &ldquo;No woman had
      been to the summit of Mont Blanc,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;till one young girl, named
      Marie, resolved to have this glory. The guides told her it was madness,
      but she persevered. She took the staff, and everything requisite, and,
      following a party, began the ascent. She bravely supported every fatigue,
      climbed each precipice, was undaunted by the giddy heights she attained,
      bravely crossed the fields of snow, supported the bitter cold, and
      finally, though suffering severely, arrived at the topmost peak, looked
      forth where woman had never looked before, felt her heart swell at the
      attainment of her utmost ambition, and the name of Marie was inscribed as
      that of the woman who alone has had the glory of standing on the summit of
      the Giant of the Alps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was prettily enunciated, and had a pleasing effect. Meta stood conning
      the words&mdash;woman&mdash;giant&mdash;mountain&mdash;glory&mdash;and
      begged for another tale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mine shall not be so stupid as Flora&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Harry. &ldquo;We have an old
      sailor on board the Alcestis&mdash;a giant he might be for his voice&mdash;but
      he sailed once in the Glory of the West, and there they had a monkey that
      was picked up in Africa, and one day this old fellow found his queer
      messmate, as he called him, spying through a glass, just like the captain.
      The captain had a glorious collection of old coins, and the like, dug up
      in some of the old Greek colonies, and whenever Master Monkey saw him
      overhauling them, he would get out a brass button, or a card or two, and
      turn &lsquo;em over, and chatter at them, and glory over them, quite knowing,&rdquo;
       said Harry, imitating the gesture, &ldquo;and I dare say he saw V.V., and
      Tiberius Caesar, as well as the best of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Harry,&rdquo; said Meta. &ldquo;I think we are at no loss for monkeys
      here. But I have not the word yet. Who comes next? Ethel&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall blunder, I forewarn you,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;but this is mine: There
      was a young king who had an old tutor, whom he despised because he was so
      strict, so he got rid of him, and took to idle sport. One day, when he was
      out hunting in a forest, a white hind came and ran before him, till she
      guided him to a castle, and there he found a lady all dressed in white,
      with a beamy crown on head, and so nobly beautiful that he fell in love
      with her at once, and was only sorry to see another prince who was come to
      her palace too. She told them her name was Gloria, and that she had had
      many suitors, but the choice did not depend on herself&mdash;she could
      only be won by him who deserved her, and for three years they were to be
      on their probation, trying for her. So she dismissed them, only burning to
      gain her, and telling them to come back in three years&rsquo; time. But they had
      not gone far before they saw another palace, much finer, all glittering
      with gold and silver, and their Lady Gloria came out to meet them, not in
      her white dress, but in one all gay and bright with fine colours, and her
      crown they now saw was of diamonds. She told them they had only seen her
      everyday dress and house, this was her best; and she showed them about the
      castle, and all the pictures of her former lovers. There was Alexander,
      who had been nearer retaining her than any one, only the fever prevented
      it; there was Pyrrhus, always seeking her, but slain by a tile; Julius
      Caesar&mdash;Tamerlane&mdash;all the rest, and she hoped that one of these
      two would really prove worthy and gain her, by going in the same path as
      these great people.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So our prince went home; his head full of being like Alexander and all
      the rest of them, and he sent for his good old tutor to reckon up his
      armies, and see whom he could conquer in order to win her. But the old
      tutor told him he was under a mistake; the second lady he had seen was a
      treacherous cousin of Gloria, who drew away her suitors by her deceits,
      and whose real name was Vana Gloria. If he wished to earn the true Gloria,
      he must set to work to do his subjects good, and to be virtuous. And he
      did; he taught them, and he did justice to them, and he bore it patiently
      and kindly when they did not understand. But by-and-by the other king, who
      had no good tutor to help him, had got his armies together, and conquered
      ever so many people, and drawn off their men to be soldiers; and now he
      attacked the good prince, and was so strong that he gained the victory,
      though both prince and subjects fought manfully with heart and hand; but
      the battle was lost, and the faithful prince wounded and made prisoner,
      but bearing it most patiently, till he was dragged behind the other&rsquo;s
      triumphal car with all the rest, when the three years were up, to be
      presented to Vana Gloria. And so he was carried into the forest, bleeding
      and wounded, and his enemy drove the car over his body, and stretched out
      his arms to Vana Gloria, and found her a vain, ugly wretch, who grew
      frightful as soon as he grasped her. But the good dying prince saw the
      beautiful beamy face of his lady&mdash;love bending over him. &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; he
      said, &lsquo;vision of my life, hast thou come to lighten my dying eyes? Never&mdash;never,
      even in my best days, did I deem that I could be worthy of thee; the more
      I strove, the more I knew that Gloria is for none below&mdash;for me less
      than all.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then the lady came and lifted him up, and she said, &lsquo;Gloria is given
      to all who do and suffer truly in a good cause, for faithfulness is glory,
      and that is thine.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel&rsquo;s language had become more flowing as she grew more eager in the
      tale, and they all listened with suspended interest. Norman asked where
      she got the story. &ldquo;Out of an old French book, the &lsquo;Magazin des enfans,&rsquo;&rdquo;
       was the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why did you alter the end?&rdquo; said Flora, &ldquo;why kill the poor man? He
      used to be prosperous, why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I thought,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;that glory could not properly belong to
      any one here, and if he was once conscious of it, it would be all spoiled.
      Well, Meta, do you guess?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! the word! I had forgotten all about it. I think I know what it must
      be, but I should so like another story. May I not have one?&rdquo; said Meta
      coaxingly. &ldquo;Mary, it is you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary fell back on her papa, and begged him to take hers. Papa told the
      best stories of all, she said, and Meta looked beseeching.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My story will not be as long as Ethel&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said the doctor, yielding with
      a half-reluctant smile. &ldquo;My story is of a humming-bird, a little creature
      that loved its master with all its strength, and longed to do somewhat for
      him. It was not satisfied with its lot, because it seemed merely a vain
      and profitless creature. The nightingale sang praise, and the woods
      sounded with the glory of its strains; the fowl was valued for its flesh,
      the ostrich for its plume, but what could the little humming-bird do, save
      rejoice in the glory of the flood of sunbeams, and disport itself over the
      flowers, and glance in the sunny light, as its bright breastplate flashed
      from rich purple to dazzling flame-colour, and its wings supported it,
      fluttering so fast that the eye could hardly trace them, as it darted its
      slender beak into the deep-belled blossoms. So the little bird grieved,
      and could not rest, for thinking that it was useless in this world, that
      it sought merely its own gratification, and could do nothing that could
      conduce to the glory of its master. But one night a voice spoke to the
      little bird, &lsquo;Why hast thou been placed here,&rsquo; it said, &lsquo;but at the will
      of thy master? Was it not that he might delight himself in thy radiant
      plumage, and see thy joy in the sunshine? His gifts are thy buoyant wing,
      thy beauteous colours, the love of all around, the sweetness of the
      honey-drop in the flowers, the shade of the palm leaf. Esteem them, then,
      as his; value thine own bliss, while it lasts, as the token of his care
      and love; and while thy heart praises him for them, and thy wings quiver
      and dance to the tune of that praise, then, indeed, thy gladness conduces
      to no vain-glory of thine own, in beauty, or in graceful flight, but thou
      art a creature serving&mdash;as best thou canst to his glory.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know the word,&rdquo; half whispered Meta, not without a trembling of the
      lip. &ldquo;I know why you told the story, Dr. May, but one is not as good as
      the humming-birds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The elder ladies had begun to look at watches, and talk of time to go
      home; and Jem Jemmings having been seen rearing himself up from behind the
      barrow, the doctor proceeded to investigate his case, was perfectly
      satisfied of the boy&rsquo;s truth, and as ready as the young ones to befriend
      him. A letter should be written at once, desiring his father to look out
      for him on Friday, when he should go by the same train as Harry, who was
      delighted at the notion of protecting him so far, and begged to be allowed
      to drive him home to Stoneborough in the gig.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consent was given; and Richard being added to give weight and discretion,
      the gig set out at once&mdash;the doctor, much to Meta&rsquo;s delight, took his
      place in the brake. Blanche, who, in the morning, had been inclined to
      despise it as something akin to a cart, now finding it a popular
      conveyance, was urgent to return in it; and Flora was made over to the
      carriage, not at all unwillingly, for, though it separated her from Meta,
      it made a senior of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norman&rsquo;s fate conveyed him to the exalted seat beside the driver of the
      brake, where he could only now and then catch the sounds of mirth from
      below. He had enjoyed the day exceedingly, with that sort of abandon more
      than ordinarily delicious to grave or saddened temperaments, when roused
      or drawn out for a time. Meta&rsquo;s winning grace and sweetness had a peculiar
      charm for him, and, perhaps, his having been originally introduced to her
      as ill, and in sorrow, had given her manner towards him a sort of kindness
      which was very gratifying.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now he felt as if he was going back to a very dusky dusty world; the
      last and blithest day of his holidays was past, and he must return to the
      misapprehensions and injustice that had blighted his school career, be
      kept beneath boys with half his ability, and without generous feeling, and
      find all his attainments useless in restoring his position. Dr. Hoxton&rsquo;s
      dull scholarship would chill all pleasure in his studies&mdash;there would
      be no companionship among the boys&mdash;even his supporters, Ernescliffe
      and Larkins, were gone, and Harry would leave him still under a cloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norman felt it more as disgrace than he had done since the first, and
      wished he had consented to quit the school when it had been offered&mdash;be
      made a man, instead of suffering these doubly irksome provocations, which
      rose before him in renewed force. &ldquo;And what would that little humming-bird
      think of me if she knew me disgraced?&rdquo; thought he. &ldquo;But it is of no use to
      think of it. I must go through with it, and as I always am getting
      vain-glorious, I had better have no opportunity. I did not declare I
      renounced vain pomp and glory last week, to begin coveting them now
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Norman repressed the sigh as he looked at the school buildings, which
      never could give him the pleasures of memory they afforded to others.
    </p>
    <p>
      The brake had set out before the carriage, so that Meta had to come in and
      wait for her governess. Before the vehicle had disgorged half its
      contents, Harry had rushed out to meet them. &ldquo;Come in, come in, Norman!
      Only hear. Margaret shall tell you herself! Hurrah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Is Mr. Ernescliffe come? crossed Ethel&rsquo;s mind, but Margaret was alone,
      flushed, and holding out her hands. &ldquo;Norman! where is he? Dear Norman,
      here is good news! Papa, Dr. Hoxton has been here, and he knows all about
      it&mdash;and oh! Norman, he is very sorry for the injustice, and you are
      dux again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norman really trembled so much that he could neither speak nor stand, but
      sat down on the window-seat, while a confusion of tongues asked more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Hoxton and Mr. Larkins had come to call&mdash;heard no one was at home
      but Miss May&mdash;had, nevertheless, come in&mdash;and Margaret had heard
      that Mr. Larkins, who had before intended to remove his son from
      Stoneborough, had, in the course of the holidays, made discoveries from
      him, which he could not feel justified in concealing from Dr. Hoxton.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole of the transactions with Ballhatchet, and Norman&rsquo;s part in them,
      had been explained, as well as the true history of the affray in Randall&rsquo;s
      Alley&mdash;how Norman had dispersed the boys, how they had again
      collected, and, with the full concurrence of Harvey Anderson, renewed the
      mischief, how the Andersons had refused to bear witness in his favour, and
      how Ballhatchet&rsquo;s ill-will had kept back the evidence which would have
      cleared him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Larkins had told all, and his father had no scruple in repeating
      it, and causing the investigation to be set on foot. Nay, he deemed that
      Norman&rsquo;s influence had saved his son, and came, as anxious to thank him,
      as Dr. Hoxton, warm-hearted, though injudicious, was to repair his
      injustice. They were much surprised and struck by finding that Dr. May had
      been aware of the truth the whole time, and had patiently put up with the
      injustice, and the loss of the scholarship&mdash;a loss which Dr. Hoxton
      would have given anything to repair, so as to have sent up a scholar
      likely to do him so much credit; but it was now too late, and he had only
      been able to tell Margaret how dismayed he was at finding out that the boy
      to whom all the good order in his school was owing had been so ill-used.
      Kind Dr. May&rsquo;s first feeling really seemed to be pity and sympathy for his
      old friend, the head-master, in the shock of such a discovery. Harry was
      vociferously telling his version of the story to Ethel and Mary. Tom stood
      transfixed in attention. Meta, forgotten and bewildered, was standing near
      Norman, whose colour rapidly varied, and whose breath came short and quick
      as he listened. A quick half interrogation passed Meta&rsquo;s lips, heard by no
      one else.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is only that it is all right,&rdquo; he answered, scarcely audibly; &ldquo;they
      have found out the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&mdash;who?&mdash;you?&rdquo; said Meta, as she heard words that implied
      the past suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Norman, &ldquo;I was suspected, but never at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is it over now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; he whispered huskily, &ldquo;all is right, and Harry will not leave
      me in disgrace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meta did not speak, but she held out her hand in hearty congratulation;
      Norman, scarce knowing what he did, grasped and wrung it so tight that it
      was positive pain, as he turned away his head to the window to struggle
      with those irrepressible tears. Meta&rsquo;s colour flushed into her cheek as
      she found it still held, almost unconsciously, perhaps, in his agitation,
      and she heard Margaret&rsquo;s words, that both gentlemen had said Norman had
      acted nobly, and that every revelation made in the course of their
      examination had only more fully established his admirable conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Norman, Norman, I am so glad!&rdquo; cried Mary&rsquo;s voice in the first pause,
      and, Margaret asking where he was, he suddenly turned round, recollected
      himself, and found it was not the back of the chair that he had been
      squeezing, blushed intensely, but made no attempt at apology, for indeed
      he could not speak&mdash;he only leaned down over Margaret, to receive her
      heartfelt embrace; and, as he stood up again, his father laid his hand on
      his shoulder, &ldquo;My boy, I am glad;&rdquo; but the words were broken, and, as if
      neither could bear more, Norman hastily left the room, Ethel rushing after
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite overcome!&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;and no wonder. He felt it cruelly,
      though he bore up gallantly. Well, July?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go down to school with him to-morrow, and see him dux again! I&rsquo;ll
      have three-times-three!&rdquo; shouted Harry; &ldquo;hip! hip! hurrah!&rdquo; and Tom and
      Mary joined in chorus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is all this?&rdquo; exclaimed Flora, opening the door, &ldquo;&mdash;is every
      one gone mad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Many were the voices that answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I am glad, and I hope the Andersons will make an apology. But where
      is poor Meta? Quite forgotten?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meta would not wonder if she knew all,&rdquo; said the doctor, turning, with a
      sweet smile that had in it something, nevertheless, of apology.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am so glad&mdash;so glad!&rdquo; said Meta, her eyes full of tears, as
      she came forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there was no helping it; the first kiss between Margaret May and
      Margaret Rivers was given in that overflowing sympathy of congratulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor gave her his arm to take her to the carriage, and, on the way,
      his quick warm words filled up the sketch of Norman&rsquo;s behaviour; Meta&rsquo;s
      eyes responded better than her tongue, but, to her good-bye, she could not
      help adding, &ldquo;Now I have seen true glory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His answer was much such a grip as her poor little fingers had already
      received, but though they felt hot and crushed all the way home, the
      sensation seemed to cause such throbs of joy, that she would not have been
      without it.

                                         WORDSWORTH.
</pre>
    <p>
      Harry&rsquo;s last home morning was brightened by going to the school to see
      full justice done to Norman, and enjoying the scene for him. It was indeed
      a painful ordeal to Norman himself, who could, at the moment, scarcely
      feel pleasure in his restoration, excepting for the sake of his father,
      Harry, and his sisters. To find the head-master making apologies to him
      was positively painful and embarrassing, and his countenance would have
      been fitter for a culprit receiving a lecture. It was pleasanter when the
      two other masters shook hands with him, Mr. Harrison with a free
      confession that he had done him injustice, and Mr. Wilmot with a glad look
      of congratulation, that convinced Harry he had never believed Norman to
      blame.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry himself was somewhat of a hero; the masters all spoke to him, bade
      him good speed, and wished him a happy voyage, and all the boys were eager
      to admire his uniform, and wish themselves already men and officers like
      Mr. May. He had his long-desired three cheers for &ldquo;May senior!&rdquo; shouted
      with a thorough goodwill by the united lungs of the Whichcote foundation,
      and a supplementary cheer arose for the good ship Alcestis, while hands
      were held out on every side; and the boy arrived at such a pitch of
      benevolence and good humour, as actually to volunteer a friendly shake of
      the hand to Edward Anderson, whom he encountered skulking apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, Ned, we have often licked each other before now, and don&rsquo;t
      let us bear a grudge now I am going away. We are Stoneborough fellows
      both, you know, after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edward did not refuse the offered grasp, and though his words were only,
      &ldquo;Good-bye, I hope you will have plenty of fun!&rdquo; Harry went away with a
      lighter heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest of the day Harry adhered closely to his father, though chiefly in
      silence; Dr. May had intended much advice and exhortation for his
      warm-hearted, wild-spirited son, but words would not come, not even when
      in the still evening twilight they walked down alone together to the
      cloister, and stood over the little stone marked M. M. After standing
      there for some minutes, Harry knelt to collect some of the daisies in the
      grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are those to take with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Margaret is going to make a cross of them for my Prayerbook.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, they will keep it in your mind&mdash;say it all to you, Harry. She
      may be nearer to you everywhere, though you are far from us. Don&rsquo;t put
      yourself from her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was all Dr. May contrived to say to his son, nor could Margaret do
      much more than kiss him, while tears flowed one by one over her cheeks, as
      she tried to whisper that he must remember and guard himself, and that he
      was sure of being thought of, at least, in every prayer; and then she
      fastened into his book the cross, formed of flattened daisies, gummed upon
      a framework of paper. He begged her to place it at the Baptismal Service,
      for he said, &ldquo;I like that about fighting&mdash;and I always did like the
      church being like a ship&mdash;don&rsquo;t you? I only found that prayer out the
      day poor little Daisy was christened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret had indeed a thrill of melancholy pleasure in this task, when she
      saw how it was regarded. Oh, that her boy might not lose these impressions
      amid the stormy waves he was about to encounter!
    </p>
    <p>
      That last evening of home good-nights cost Harry many a choking sob ere he
      could fall asleep; but the morning of departure had more cheerfulness; the
      pleasure of patronising Jem Jennings was as consoling to his spirits, as
      was to Mary the necessity of comforting Toby.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toby&rsquo;s tastes were in some respects vulgar, as he preferred the stable,
      and Will Adams, to all Mary&rsquo;s attentions; but he attached himself
      vehemently to Dr. May, followed him everywhere, and went into raptures at
      the slightest notice from him. The doctor said it was all homage to the
      master of the house. Margaret held that the dog was a physiognomist.
    </p>
    <p>
      The world was somewhat flat after the loss of Harry&mdash;that element of
      riot and fun; Aubrey was always playing at &ldquo;poor Harry sailing away,&rdquo; Mary
      looked staid and sober, and Norman was still graver, and more devoted to
      books, while Ethel gave herself up more completely to the thickening
      troubles of Cocksmoor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jealousies had arisen there, and these, with some rebukes for failures in
      sending children to be taught, had led to imputations on the character of
      Mrs. Green, in whose house the school was kept. Ethel was at first
      vehement in her defence; then when stronger evidence was adduced of the
      woman&rsquo;s dishonesty, she was dreadfully shocked, and wanted to give up all
      connection with her, and in both moods was equally displeased with Richard
      for pausing, and not going all lengths with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wilmot was appealed to, and did his best to investigate, but the only
      result was to discover that no one interrogated had any notion of truth,
      except John Taylor, and he knew nothing of the matter. The mass of
      falsehood, spite, violence, and dishonesty, that became evident, was
      perfectly appalling, and not a clue was to be found to the truth&mdash;scarcely
      a hope that minds so lost to honourable feeling were open to receive good
      impressions. It was a great distress to Ethel&mdash;it haunted her night
      and day&mdash;she lay awake pondering on the vain hopes for her poor
      children, and slept to dream of the angry faces and rude accusations.
      Margaret grew quite anxious about her, and her elders were seriously
      considering the propriety of her continuing her labours at Cocksmoor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wilmot would not be at Stoneborough after Christmas. His father&rsquo;s
      declining health made him be required at home, and since Richard was so
      often absent, it became matter of doubt whether the Misses May ought to be
      allowed to persevere, unassisted by older heads, in such a locality.
    </p>
    <p>
      This doubt put Ethel into an agony. Though she had lately been declaring
      that it made her very unhappy to go&mdash;she could not bear the sight of
      Mrs. Green, and that she knew all her efforts were vain while the poor
      children had such homes; she now only implored to be allowed to go on; she
      said that the badness of the people only made it more needful to do their
      utmost for them; there were no end to the arguments that she poured forth
      upon her ever kind listener, Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear Ethel, yes, but pray be calm; I know papa and Mr. Wilmot would
      not put a stop to it if they could possibly help it, but if it is not
      proper&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Proper! that is as bad as Miss Winter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ethel, you and I cannot judge of these things&mdash;you must leave them
      to our elders&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And men always are so fanciful about ladies&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, if you speak in that way, I shall think it is really hurting
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not mean it, dear Margaret,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;but if you knew what I
      feel for poor Cocksmoor, you would not wonder that I cannot bear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not wonder, dearest; but if this trial is sent you, perhaps it is to
      train you for better things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it is for my fault,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;Oh, oh, if it be that I am too
      unworthy! And it is the only hope; no one will do anything to teach these
      poor creatures if I give it up. What shall I do, Margaret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret drew her down close to her, and whispered, &ldquo;Trust them Ethel,
      dear. The decision will be whatever is the will of God. If He thinks fit
      to give you the work, it will come; if not, He will give you some other,
      and provide for them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I have been too neglectful of home, too vain of persevering when no
      one but Richard would!&rdquo; sighed Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot see that you have, dearest,&rdquo; said Margaret fondly, &ldquo;but your own
      heart must tell you that. And now, only try to be calm and patient.
      Getting into these fits of despair is the very thing to make people decide
      against you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will! I will! I will try to be patient,&rdquo; sobbed Ethel; &ldquo;I know to be
      wayward and set on it would only hurt. I might only do more harm&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
      try. But oh, my poor children!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret gave a little space for the struggle with herself, then advised
      her resolutely to fix her attention on something else. It was a Saturday
      morning, and time was more free than usual, so Margaret was able to
      persuade her to continue a half-forgotten drawing, while listening to an
      interesting article in a review, which opened to her that there were too
      many Cocksmoors in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dinner-hour sounded too soon, and as she was crossing the hall to put
      away her drawing materials, the front door gave the click peculiar to Dr.
      May&rsquo;s left-handed way of opening it. She paused, and saw him enter,
      flushed, and with a look that certified her that something had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Ethel, he is come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, papa, Mr. Ernes&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held up his finger, drew her into the study, and shut the door. The
      expression of mystery and amusement gave way to sadness and gravity as he
      sat down in his arm-chair, and sighed as if much fatigued. She was checked
      and alarmed, but she could not help asking, &ldquo;Is he here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the Swan. He came last night, and watched for me this morning as I
      came out of the hospital. We have been walking over the meadows to
      Fordholm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No wonder Dr. May was hot and tired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But is he not coming?&rdquo; asked Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, poor fellow; but hush, stop, say nothing to the others. I must not
      have her agitated till she has had her dinner in peace, and the house is
      quiet. You know she cannot run away to her room as you would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he is really come for that?&rdquo; cried Ethel breathlessly; and,
      perceiving the affirmative, added, &ldquo;But why did he wait so long?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wished to see his way through his affairs, and also wanted to hear of
      her from Harry. I am afraid poor July&rsquo;s colours were too bright.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why did he come to the Swan instead of to us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was his fine, noble feeling. He thought it right to see me first,
      that if I thought the decision too trying for Margaret, in her present
      state, or if I disapproved of the long engagement, I might spare her all
      knowledge of his coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, papa, you won&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know but that I ought; but yet, the fact is, that I cannot. With
      that fine young fellow so generously, fondly attached I cannot find it in
      my heart to send him away for four years without seeing her, and yet, poor
      things, it might be better for them both. Oh, Ethel, if your mother were
      but here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rested his forehead on his hands, and Ethel stood aghast at his
      unexpected reception of the addresses for which she had so long hoped. She
      did not venture to speak, and presently he roused himself as the
      dinner-bell rang. &ldquo;One comfort is,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that Margaret has more
      composure than I. Do you go to Cocksmoor this afternoon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wished it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take them all with you. You may tell them why when you are out. I must
      have the house quiet. I shall get Margaret out into the shade, and prepare
      her, as best I can, before he comes at three o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not flattering to be thus cleared out of the way, especially when
      full of excited curiosity, but any such sensation was quite overborne by
      sympathy in his great anxiety, and Ethel&rsquo;s only question was, &ldquo;Had not
      Flora better stay to keep off company?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Dr. May impatiently, &ldquo;the fewer the better;&rdquo; and hastily
      passing her, he dashed up to his room, nearly running over the nursery
      procession, and, in a very few seconds, was seated at table, eating and
      speaking by snatches, and swallowing endless draughts of cold water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are going to Cocksmoor!&rdquo; said he, as they were finishing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the right day,&rdquo; said Richard. &ldquo;Are you coming, Flora?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to-day, I have to call on Mrs. Hoxton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind Mrs. Hoxton,&rdquo; said the doctor; &ldquo;you had better go to-day, a
      fine cool day for a walk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not look as if he had found it so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, Flora, you must come,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;we want you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have engagements at home,&rdquo; replied Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it really is a trying walk,&rdquo; said Miss Winter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must,&rdquo; reiterated Ethel. &ldquo;Come to our room, and I will tell you why.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not mean to go to Cocksmoor till something positive is settled. I
      cannot have anything to do with that woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you would only come upstairs,&rdquo; implored Ethel, at the door, &ldquo;I have
      something to tell you alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall come up in due time. I thought you had outgrown closetings and
      foolish secrets,&rdquo; said Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her movements were quickened, however, by her father, who, finding her
      with Margaret in the drawing-room, ordered her upstairs in a peremptory
      manner, which she resented, as treating her like a child, and therefore
      proceeded in no amiable mood to the room, where Ethel awaited her in wild
      tumultuous impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Ethel, what is this grand secret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Flora! Mr. Ernescliffe is at the Swan! He has been speaking to papa
      about Margaret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Proposing for her, do you mean?&rdquo; said Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he is coming to see her this afternoon, and that is the reason that
      papa wants us to be all out of the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did papa tell you this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ethel, beginning to perceive the secret of her displeasure,
      &ldquo;but only because I was the first person he met; and Norman guessed it
      long ago. Do put on your things! I&rsquo;ll tell you all I know when we are out.
      Papa is so anxious to have the coast clear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; said Flora; &ldquo;but I shall not go with you. Do not be afraid
      of my interfering with any one. I shall sit here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But papa said you were to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he had done me the favour of speaking to me himself,&rdquo; said Flora, &ldquo;I
      should have shown him that it is not right that Margaret should be left
      without any one at hand in case she should be overcome. He is of no use in
      such cases, only makes things worse. I should not feel justified in
      leaving Margaret with no one else, but he is in one of those
      hand-over-head moods, when it is not of the least use to say a word to
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flora, how can you, when he expressly ordered you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All he meant was, do not be in the way, and I shall not show myself
      unless I am needed, when he would be glad enough of me. I am not bound to
      obey the very letter, like Blanche or Mary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel looked horrified by the assertion of independence, but Richard
      called her from below, and, with one more fruitless entreaty, she ran
      downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard had been hearing all from his father, and it was comfortable to
      talk the matter over with him, and hear explained the anxiety which
      frightened her, while she scarcely comprehended it; how Dr. May could not
      feel certain whether it was right or expedient to promote an engagement
      which must depend on health so uncertain as poor Margaret&rsquo;s, and how he
      dreaded the effect on the happiness of both.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel&rsquo;s romance seemed to be turning to melancholy, and she walked on
      gravely and thoughtfully, though repeating that there could be no doubt of
      Margaret&rsquo;s perfect recovery by the time of the return from the voyage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her lessons were somewhat nervous and flurried, and even the sight of two
      very nice neat new scholars, of very different appearance from the rest,
      and of much superior attainments, only half interested her. Mary was
      enchanted at them as a pair of prodigies, actually able to read! and had
      made out their names, and their former abodes, and how they had been used
      to go to school, and had just come to live in the cottage deserted by the
      lamented Una.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel thought it quite provoking in her brother to accede to Mary&rsquo;s
      entreaties that they should go and call on this promising importation.
      Even the children&rsquo;s information that they were taught now by &ldquo;Sister
      Cherry&rdquo; failed to attract her; but Richard looked at his watch, and
      decided that it was too soon to go home, and she had to submit to her
      fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very different was the aspect of the house from the wild Irish cabin
      appearance that it had in the M&rsquo;Carthy days. It was the remains of an old
      farm-house that had seen better days, somewhat larger than the general run
      of the Cocksmoor dwellings. Respectable furniture had taken up its abode
      against the walls, the kitchen was well arranged, and, in spite of the
      wretched flooring and broken windows, had an air of comfort. A very tidy
      woman was bustling about, still trying to get rid of the relics of her
      former tenants, who might, she much feared, have left a legacy of typhus
      fever. The more interesting person was, however, a young woman of three or
      four and twenty, pale, and very lame, and with the air of a respectable
      servant, her manners particularly pleasing. It appeared that she was the
      daughter of a first wife, and, after the period of schooling, had been at
      service, but had been lamed by a fall downstairs, and had been obliged to
      come home, just as scarcity of work had caused her father to leave his
      native parish, and seek employment at other quarries. She had hoped to
      obtain plain work, but all the family were dismayed and disappointed at
      the wild spot to which they had come, and anxiously availed themselves of
      this introduction to beg that the elder boy and girl might be admitted
      into the town school, distant as it was. At another time, the thought of
      Charity Elwood would have engrossed Ethel&rsquo;s whole mind, now she could
      hardly attend, and kept looking eagerly at Richard as he talked endlessly
      with the good mother. When, at last, they did set off, he would not let
      her gallop home like a steam-engine, but made her take his arm, when he
      found that she could not otherwise moderate her steps. At the long hill a
      figure appeared, and, as soon as Richard was certified of its identity, he
      let her fly, like a bolt from a crossbow, and she stood by Dr. May&rsquo;s side.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little ashamed, she blushed instead of speaking, and waited for Richard
      to come up and begin. Neither did he say anything, and they paused till,
      the silence disturbing her, she ventured a &ldquo;Well, papa!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, poor things. She was quite overcome when first I told her&mdash;said
      it would be hard on him, and begged me to tell him that he would be much
      happier if he thought no more of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did Margaret?&rdquo; cried Ethel. &ldquo;Oh! could she mean it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She thought she meant it, poor dear, and repeated such things again and
      again; but when I asked whether I should send him away without seeing her,
      she cried more than ever, and said, &lsquo;You are tempting me! It would be
      selfishness.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear! she surely has seen him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told her that I would be the last person to wish to tempt her to
      selfishness, but that I did not think that either could be easy in
      settling such a matter through a third person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would have been very unkind,&rdquo; said Ethel; &ldquo;I wonder she did not think
      so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She did at last. I saw it could not be otherwise, and she said, poor
      darling, that when he had seen her, he would know the impossibility; but
      she was so agitated that I did not know how it could be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, I told him not to stay too long, and left him under the tulip-tree
      with her. I found her much more composed&mdash;he was so gentle and
      considerate. Ah! he is the very man! Besides, he has convinced her now
      that affection brings him, not mere generosity, as she fancied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, then it is settled!&rdquo; cried Ethel joyously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish it were! She has owned that if&mdash;if she were in health&mdash;but
      that is all, and he is transported with having gained so much! Poor
      fellow. So far, I trust, it is better for them to know each other&rsquo;s minds,
      but how it is to be&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, papa, you know Sir Matthew Fleet said she was sure to get well; and
      in three years&rsquo; time&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, that is the best chance. But it is a dreary lookout for two
      young things. That is in wiser hands, however! If only I saw what was
      right to do! My miserable carelessness has undone you all!&rdquo; he concluded,
      almost inaudibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was indeed, to him, a time of great distress and perplexity, wishing to
      act the part of father and mother both towards his daughter, acutely
      feeling his want of calm decision, and torn to pieces at once by sympathy
      with the lovers, and by delicacy that held him back from seeming to bind
      the young man to an uncertain engagement, above all, tortured by
      self-reproach for the commencement of the attachment, and for the
      misfortune that had rendered its prosperity doubtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel could find no words of comfort in the bewildered glimpse at his
      sorrow and agitation. Richard spoke with calmness and good sense, and his
      replies, though brief and commonplace, were not without effect in
      lessening the excitement and despondency which the poor doctor&rsquo;s present
      mood had been aggravating.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the door, Dr. May asked for Flora, and Ethel explained. If Flora had
      obtruded herself, he would have been irritated, but, as it was, he had no
      time to observe the disobedience, and saying that he hoped she was with
      Margaret, sent Ethel into the drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora was not there, only Margaret lay on her sofa, and Ethel hesitated,
      shy, curious, and alarmed; but, as she approached, she was relieved to see
      the blue eyes more serene even than usual, while a glow of colour spread
      over her face, making her like the blooming Margaret of old times; her
      expression was full of peace, but became somewhat amused at Ethel&rsquo;s timid,
      awkward pauses, as she held out her hands, and said, &ldquo;Come, dear Ethel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Margaret, Margaret!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Ethel was drawn into her sister&rsquo;s bosom. Presently she drew back,
      gazed at her sister inquiringly, and said in an odd, doubtful voice, &ldquo;Then
      you are glad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret nearly laughed at the strange manner, but spoke with a sorrowful
      tone, &ldquo;Glad in one way, dearest, almost too glad, and grateful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am so glad!&rdquo; again said Ethel; &ldquo;I thought it was making everybody
      unhappy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe I could be that, now he has come, now I know;&rdquo; and her
      voice trembled. &ldquo;There must be doubt and uncertainty,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;but I
      cannot dwell on them just yet. They will settle what is right, I know,
      and, happen what may, I have always this to remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that is right! Papa will be so relieved! He was afraid it had only
      been distress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor papa! Yes, I did not command myself at first; I was not sure whether
      it was right to see him at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Margaret, that was too bad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It did not seem right to encourage any such&mdash;such,&rdquo; the word was
      lost, &ldquo;to such a poor helpless thing as I am. I did not know what to do,
      and I am afraid I behaved like a silly child, and did not think of dear
      papa&rsquo;s feelings. But I will try to be good, and leave it all to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you are going to be happy?&rdquo; said Ethel wistfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the present, at least. I cannot help it,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;Oh, he is
      so kind, and so unselfish, and so beautifully gentle&mdash;and to think of
      his still caring! But there, dear Ethel, I am not going to cry; do call
      papa, or he will think me foolish again. I want him to be quite at ease
      about me before he comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he is coming?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, at tea-time&mdash;so run, dear Ethel, and tell Jane to get his room
      ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The message quickened Ethel, and after giving it, and reporting
      consolingly to her father, she went up to Flora, who had been a voluntary
      prisoner upstairs all this time, and was not peculiarly gratified at such
      tidings coming only through the medium of Ethel. She had before been
      sensible that, superior in discretion and effectiveness as she was
      acknowledged to be, she did not share so much of the confidence and
      sympathy as some of the others, and she felt mortified and injured, though
      in this case it was entirely her own fault. The sense of alienation grew
      upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She dressed quickly, and hurried down, that she might see Margaret alone;
      but the room was already prepared for tea, and the children were fast
      assembling. Ethel came down a few minutes after, and found Blanche
      claiming Alan Ernescliffe as her lawful property, dancing round him,
      chattering, and looking injured if he addressed a word to any one else.
    </p>
    <p>
      How did lovers look? was a speculation which had, more than once, occupied
      Ethel, and when she had satisfied herself that her father was at ease, she
      began to study it, as soon as a shamefaced consciousness would allow her,
      after Alan&rsquo;s warm shake of the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret looked much as usual, only with more glow and brightness&mdash;Mr.
      Ernescliffe, not far otherwise; he was as pale and slight as on his last
      visit, with the same soft blue eyes, capable, however, of a peculiar,
      keen, steady glance when he was listening, and which now seemed to be
      attending to Margaret&rsquo;s every word or look, through all the delighted
      uproar which Aubrey, Blanche, and Mary kept up round him, or while taking
      his share in the general conversation, telling of Harry&rsquo;s popularity and
      good conduct on board the Alcestis, or listening to the history of
      Norman&rsquo;s school adventures, which he had heard, in part, from Harry, and
      how young Jennings was entered in the flag-ship, as a boy, though not yet
      to sail with his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the storm of the day the sky seemed quite clear, and Ethel could not
      see that being lovers made much difference; to be sure papa displeased
      Blanche, by calling her away to his side, when she would squeeze her chair
      in between Alan&rsquo;s and the sofa; and Alan took all the waiting on Margaret
      exclusively to himself. Otherwise, there was nothing remarkable, and he
      was very much the same Mr. Ernescliffe whom they had received a year ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      In truth, the next ten days were very happy. The future was left to rest,
      and Alan spent his mornings in the drawing-room alone with Margaret, and
      looked ever more brightly placid, while, with the rest, he was more than
      the former kind playfellow, for he now took his place as the affectionate
      elder brother, entering warmly into all their schemes and pleasures, and
      winning for himself a full measure of affection from all; even his little
      god-daughter began to know him, and smile at his presence. Margaret and
      Ethel especially delighted in the look of enjoyment with which their
      father sat down to enter on the evening&rsquo;s conversation after the day&rsquo;s
      work; and Flora was well pleased that Mrs. Hoxton should find Alan in the
      drawing-room, and ask afterwards about his estate; and that Meta Rivers,
      after being certified that this was their Mr. Ernescliffe, pronounced that
      her papa thought him particularly pleasing and gentlemanlike. There was
      something dignified in having a sister on the point of being engaged.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVIII.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Sail forth into the sea, thou ship,
       Through breeze and cloud, right onward steer;
     The moistened eye, the trembling lip,
       Are not the signs of doubt or fear!&mdash;LONGFELLOW.
</pre>
    <p>
      Tranquility only lasted until Mr. Ernescliffe found it necessary to
      understand on what terms he was to stand. Every one was tender of
      conscience, anxious to do right, and desirous to yield to the opinion that
      nobody could, or would give. While Alan begged for a positive engagement,
      Margaret scrupled to exchange promises that she might never be able to
      fulfil, and both agreed to leave all to her father, who, in every way,
      ought to have the best ability to judge whether there was unreasonable
      presumption in such a betrothal; but this very ability only served to
      perplex the poor doctor more and more. It is far easier for a man to
      decide when he sees only one bearing of a case, than when, like Dr. May,
      he not only sees them, but is rent by them in his inmost heart.
      Sympathising in turn with each lover, bitterly accusing his own
      carelessness as the cause of all their troubles, his doubts contending
      with his hopes, his conviction clashing with Sir Matthew Fleet&rsquo;s opinion,
      his conscientious sincerity and delicacy conflicting with his affection
      and eagerness, he was perfectly incapable of coming to a decision, and
      suffered so cruelly, that Margaret was doubly distressed for his sake, and
      Alan felt himself guilty of having rendered everybody miserable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. May could not conceal his trouble, and rendered Ethel almost as
      unhappy as himself, after each conversation with her, though her hopes
      usually sprang up again, and she had a happy conviction that this was only
      the second volume of the novel. Flora was not often called into his
      councils; confidence never came spontaneously from Dr. May to her; there
      was something that did not draw it forth towards her, whether it resided
      in that half-sarcastic corner of her steady blue eye, or in the grave
      common-sense of her gentle voice. Her view of the case was known to be
      that there was no need for so much perplexity&mdash;why should not Alan be
      the best judge of his own happiness? If Margaret were to be delicate for
      life, it would be better to have such a home to look to; and she soothed
      and comforted Margaret, and talked in a strain of unmixed hope and
      anticipation that often drew a smile from her sister, though she feared to
      trust to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora&rsquo;s tact and consideration in keeping the children away when the
      lovers could best be alone, and letting them in when the discussion was
      becoming useless and harassing, her cheerful smiles, her evening music
      that covered all sounds, her removal of all extra annoyances, were
      invaluable, and Margaret appreciated them, as, indeed, Flora took care
      that she should.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret begged to know her eldest brother&rsquo;s judgment, but had great
      difficulty in dragging it out. Diffidently as it was proposed, it was
      clear and decided. He thought that his father had better send Sir Matthew
      Fleet a statement of Margaret&rsquo;s present condition, and abide by his answer
      as to whether her progress warranted the hope of her restoration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never was Richard more surprised than by the gratitude with which his
      suggestion was hailed, simple as it was, so that it seemed obvious that
      others should have already thought of it. After the tossings of
      uncertainty, it was a positive relief to refer the question to some
      external voice, and only Ethel and Norman expressed strong dislike to Sir
      Matthew becoming the arbiter of Margaret&rsquo;s fate, and were scarcely
      pacified by Dr. May&rsquo;s assurance that he had not revealed the occasion of
      his inquiry. The letter was sent, and repose returned, but hearts beat
      high on the morning when the answer was expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. May watched the moment when his daughter was alone, carried the letter
      to her, and kissing her, said, with an oppressed voice, &ldquo;I give you joy,
      my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She read with suspended breath and palpitating heart. Sir Matthew thought
      her improvement sure, though slow, and had barely a doubt that, in a year,
      she would have regained her full strength and activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will show it to Alan,&rdquo; said Dr. May, as Margaret lifted her eyes to
      his face inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will not you?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I wish I was more helpful to you, my child,&rdquo; he
      added wistfully, &ldquo;but you will rest on him, and be happy together while he
      stays, will you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I will, dear papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ernescliffe was with her as the doctor quitted her. She held the
      letter to him, &ldquo;But,&rdquo; she said slowly, &ldquo;I see that papa does not believe
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You promised to abide by it!&rdquo; he exclaimed, between entreaty and
      authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do; if you choose so to risk your hopes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; cried he, as he glanced hastily over the letter, &ldquo;there can be no
      doubt! These words are as certain as language can make them. Why will you
      not trust them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see that papa does not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Despondency and self-reproach made him morbidly anxious. Believe so, my
      Margaret! You know he is no surgeon!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His education included that line,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;I believe he has all
      but the manual dexterity. However, I would fain have faith in Sir
      Matthew,&rdquo; she added, smiling, &ldquo;and perhaps I am only swayed by the habit
      of thinking that papa must know best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He does in indifferent cases; but it is an old axiom, that a medical man
      should not prescribe for his own family; above all, in such a case, where
      it is but reasonable to believe an unprejudiced stranger, who alone is
      cool enough to be relied on. I absolutely depend on him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret absolutely depended on the bright cheerful look of conviction.
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we will try to make papa take pleasure in the prospect.
      Perhaps I could do more if I made the attempt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure you could, if you would let me give you more support. If I were
      but going to remain with you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let us be discontented,&rdquo; said Margaret, smiling, &ldquo;when so much more
      has been granted than I dare to hope. Be it as it may, let us be happy in
      what we have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It makes you happy?&rdquo; said he, archly reading her face to draw out the
      avowal, but he only made her hide it, with a mute caress of the hand that
      held hers. She was glad enough to rest in the present, now that everything
      concurred to satisfy her conscience in so doing, and come what might, the
      days now spent together would be a possession of joy for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Gordon contrived to afford his lieutenant another fortnight&rsquo;s
      leave, perhaps because he was in dread of losing him altogether, for Alan
      had some doubts, and many longings to remain. Had it been possible to
      marry at once, he would have quitted the navy immediately; and he would
      have given worlds to linger beside Margaret&rsquo;s couch, and claim her the
      first moment possible, believing his care more availing than all. He was,
      however, so pledged to Captain Gordon, that, without strong cause, he
      would not have been justified in withdrawing; besides, Harry was under his
      charge, and Dr. May and Margaret both thought, with the captain, that an
      active life would be a better occupation for him than watching her. He
      would never be able to settle down at his new home comfortably without
      her, and he would be more in the way of duty while pursuing his
      profession, so Margaret nerved herself against using her influence to
      detain him, and he thanked her for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though hope and affection could not an once repair an injured spine, they
      had wonderful powers in inciting Margaret to new efforts. Alan was as
      tender and ready of hand as Richard, and more clever and enterprising; and
      her unfailing trust in him prevented all alarms and misgivings, so that
      wonders were effected, and her father beheld her standing with so little
      support, looking so healthful and so blithe, that his forebodings melted
      away, and he talked joyously of the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great achievement was taking her round the garden. She could not bear
      the motion of wheels, but Alan adopted the hammock principle, and, with
      the aid of Richard and his crony, the carpenter, produced a machine in
      which no other power on earth could have prevailed on her to trust
      herself, but in which she was carried round the garden so successfully,
      that there was even a talk of next Sunday, and of the Minster.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was safely accomplished, and tired as she was, Margaret felt, as she
      whispered to Alan, that he had now crowned all the joy that he had brought
      to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel used to watch them, and think how beautiful their countenances were,
      and talk them over with her father, who was quite happy about them now.
      She gave assistance, which Alan never once called unhandy, to all his
      contrivances, and often floundered in upon his conferences with Margaret,
      in a way that would have been very provoking, if she had not always
      blushed and looked so excessively discomfited, and they had only to laugh
      and reassure her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan was struck by finding that the casual words spoken on the way from
      Cocksmoor had been so strenuously acted on, and he brought on himself a
      whole torrent of Ethel&rsquo;s confused narratives, which Richard and Flora
      would fain have checked; but Margaret let them continue, as she saw him a
      willing listener, and was grateful to him for comprehending the ardent
      girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      He declared himself to have a share in the matter, reminding Ethel of her
      appeal to him to bind himself to the service of Cocksmoor. He sent a
      sovereign at once, to aid in a case of the sudden death of a pig; and when
      securely established in his brotherly right, he begged Ethel to let him
      know what would help her most. She stood colouring, twisting her hands,
      and wondering what to say, whereupon he relieved her by a proposal to
      leave an order for ten pounds, to be yearly paid into her hands, as a
      fixed income for her school.
    </p>
    <p>
      A thousand a year could hardly have been so much to Ethel. &ldquo;Thank you! Oh,
      this is charming! We could set up a regular school! Cherry Elwood is the
      very woman! Alan, you have made our fortune! Oh, Margaret, Margaret! I
      must go and tell Ritchie and Mary! This is the first real step to our
      church and all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I do it?&rdquo; said Alan, turning to Margaret, as Ethel frantically burst
      out of the room; &ldquo;perhaps I should have asked leave?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was going to thank you,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;It is the very kindest thing
      you could have done by dear Ethel! the greatest comfort to us. She will be
      at peace now, when anything hinders her from going to Cocksmoor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said Alan, musing, &ldquo;whether we shall ever be able to help her
      more substantially. I cannot do anything hastily, for you know Maplewood
      is still in the hands of the executors, and I cannot tell what claims
      there may be upon me; but by-and-by, when I return, if I find no other
      pressing duty, might not a church at Cocksmoor be a thankoffering for all
      I have found here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Alan, what joy it would be!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a long way off,&rdquo; he said sadly; &ldquo;and perhaps her force of
      perseverance will have prevailed alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I must not tell her, even as a vision.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is too uncertain; I do not know the wants of the Maplewood people, and
      I must provide for Hector. I would not let these vague dreams interfere
      with her resolute work; but, Margaret, what a vision it is! I can see you
      laying the first stone on that fine heathy brow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, your godchild should lay the first stone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She shall, and you shall lead her. And there shall be Ethel&rsquo;s sharp face
      full of indescribable things as she marshals her children, and Richard
      shall be curate, and read in his steady soft tone, and your father shall
      look sunny with his boys around him, and you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Alan,&rdquo; said Margaret, who had been listening with a smile, &ldquo;it is,
      indeed, a long way off!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall look to it as the haven where I would be,&rdquo; said the sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      They often spoke together of this scheme, ever decking it in brighter
      colours. The topic seemed to suit them better than their own future, for
      there was no dwelling on that without an occasional misgiving, and the
      more glad the anticipation, the deeper the sigh that followed on
      Margaret&rsquo;s part, till Mr. Ernescliffe followed her lead, and they seldom
      spoke of these uncertainties, but outwardly smiled over the present,
      inwardly dwelt on the truly certain hopes. There were readings shared
      together, made more precious than all, by the conversations that ensued.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hour for parting came at last. Ethel never knew what passed in the
      drawing-room, whence every one was carefully excluded. Dr. May wandered
      about, keeping guard over the door, and watching the clock, till, at the
      last moment, he knocked, and called in a trembling voice, &ldquo;Ernescliffe!
      Alan! it is past the quarter! You must not stay!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other farewells were hurried; Alan seemed voiceless, only nodding in
      reply to Mary&rsquo;s vociferous messages to Harry, and huskily whispering to
      Ethel, &ldquo;Good luck to Cocksmoor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next moment the door had shut on him, and Dr. May and Flora had gone
      to her sister, whom she found not tearful, but begging to be left alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they saw her again, she was cheerful; she kept up her composure and
      animation without flagging, nor did she discontinue her new exertions, but
      seemed decidedly the happier for all that had passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Letters came every day for her, and presents to every one. Ethel had a
      gold chain and eyeglass, which, it was hoped, might cure her of frowning
      and stooping, though her various ways of dangling her new possession
      caused her to be so much teased by Flora and Norman, that, but for regard
      to Margaret&rsquo;s feelings, she would not have worn it for three days.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Mary was sent a daguerreotype of Harry, her glory and delight. Say, who
      would, that it had pig&rsquo;s eyes, a savage frown, a pudding chin, there were
      his own tight rings of hair, his gold-banded cap, his bright buttons, how
      could she prize it enough? She exhibited it to the little ones ten times a
      day, she kissed it night and morning, and registered her vow always to
      sleep with it under her &ldquo;pilow,&rdquo; in a letter of thanks, which Margaret
      defended and despatched, in spite of Miss Winter&rsquo;s horrors at its
      disregard of orthography.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nearly the last letter before the Alcestis was heard of at
      Spithead. Then she sailed; she sent in her letters to Plymouth, and her
      final greetings by a Falmouth cutter&mdash;poor Harry&rsquo;s wild scrawl in
      pencil looking very sea-sick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear papa and all, good-bye. We are out of sight of land. Three years,
      and keep up a good heart. I shall soon be all right.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                                       &ldquo;Your H. MAY.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      It was enclosed in Mr. Ernescliffe&rsquo;s envelope, and with it came tidings
      that Harry&rsquo;s brave spirit was not failing, even under untoward
      circumstances, but he had struggled on deck, and tried to write, when all
      his contemporaries had given in; in fact, he was a fine fellow&mdash;every
      one liked him, and Captain Gordon, though chary of commendation, had held
      him up to the other youngsters as an example of knowing what a sailor was
      meant to be like.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret smiled, and cried over the news when she imparted it&mdash;but
      all serenely&mdash;and though she was glad to be alone, and wrote journals
      for Alan, when she could not send letters, she exerted herself to be the
      same sister as usual to the rest of the household, and not to give way to
      her wandering musings.
    </p>
    <p>
      From one subject her attention never strayed. Ethel had never found any
      lack of sympathy in her for her Cocksmoor pursuits; but the change now
      showed that, where once Margaret had been interested merely as a kind
      sister, she now had a personal concern, and she threw herself into all
      that related to it as her own chief interest and pursuit&mdash;becoming
      the foremost in devising plans, and arranging the best means of using Mr.
      Ernescliffe&rsquo;s benefaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Elwood family had grown in the good opinion of the Mays. Charity had
      hobbled to church, leaning on her father&rsquo;s arm, and being invited to
      dinner in the kitchen, the acquaintance had been improved, and nurse
      herself had pronounced her such a tidy, good sort of body, that it was a
      pity she had met with such a misfortune. If Miss Ethel brought in nothing
      but the like of her, they should be welcome; poor thing, how tired she
      was!
    </p>
    <p>
      Nurse&rsquo;s opinions were apt to be sagacious, especially when in the face of
      her prejudices, and this gave Margaret confidence. Cherry proved to have
      been carefully taught by a good clergyman and his wife, and to be of very
      different stamp from the persons to whom the girls were accustomed. They
      were charmed with her, and eagerly offered to supply her with books&mdash;respecting
      her the more when they found that Mr. Hazlewood had already lent her their
      chief favourites. Other and greater needs they had no power to fill up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is so lone without the church bells, you see, miss,&rdquo; said Mrs. Elwood.
      &ldquo;Our tower had a real fine peal, and my man was one of the ringers. I
      seems quite lost without them, and there was Cherry, went a&rsquo;most every day
      with the children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every day!&rdquo; cried Mary, looking at her with respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was so near,&rdquo; said Cherry, &ldquo;I could get there easy, and I got used to
      it when I was at school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did it not take up a great deal of time?&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you see, ma&rsquo;am, it came morning and night, out of working times, and
      I can&rsquo;t be stirring much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you miss it sadly?&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am, it made the day go on well like, and settled a body&rsquo;s mind,
      when I fretted for what could not be helped. But I try not to fret after
      it now, and Mr. Hazlewood said, if I did my best wherever I was, the Lord
      would still join our prayers together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hazlewood was recollected by Mr. Wilmot as an old college friend, and
      a correspondence with him fully confirmed the favourable estimate of the
      Elwoods, and was decisive in determining that the day-school, with Alan&rsquo;s
      ten pounds as salary, and a penny a week from each child, should be
      offered to Cherry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hazlewood answered for her sound excellence, and aptitude for managing
      little children, though he did not promise genius, such as should fulfil
      the requirements of modern days. With these Cocksmoor could dispense at
      present; Cherry was humbly gratified, and her parents delighted with the
      honour and profit; there was a kitchen which afforded great facilities,
      and Richard and his carpenter managed the fitting to admiration; Margaret
      devised all manner of useful arrangements, settled matters with great
      earnestness, saw Cherry frequently, discussed plans, and learned the
      history and character of each child, as thoroughly as Ethel herself. Mr.
      Ramsden himself came to the opening of the school, and said so much of the
      obligations of Cocksmoor to the young ladies, that Ethel would not have
      known which way to look, if Flora had not kindly borne the brunt of his
      compliments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every one was pleased, except Mrs. Green, who took upon herself to set
      about various malicious reports of Cherry Elwood; but nobody cared for
      them, except Mrs. Elwood, who flew into such passions, that Ethel was
      quite disappointed in her, though not in Cherry, who meekly tried to
      silence her mother, begged the young ladies not to be vexed, and showed a
      quiet dignity that soon made the shafts of slander fall inoffensively.
    </p>
    <p>
      All went well; there was a school instead of a hubbub, clean faces instead
      of dirty, shining hair instead of wild elf-locks, orderly children instead
      of little savages. The order and obedience that Ethel could not gain in
      six months, seemed impressed in six days by Cherry; the neat work made her
      popular with the mothers, her firm gentleness won the hearts of the
      children, and the kitchen was filled not only with boys and girls from the
      quarry, but with some little ones from outlying cottages of Fordholm and
      Abbotstoke, and there was even a smart little farmer, who had been
      unbearable at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret&rsquo;s unsuccessful bath-chair was lent to Cherry, and in it her
      scholars drew her to Stoneborough every Sunday, and slowly began to redeem
      their character with the ladies, who began to lose the habit of shrinking
      out of their way&mdash;the Stoneborough children did so instead; and Flora
      and Ethel were always bringing home stories of injustice to their
      scholars, fancied or real, and of triumphs in their having excelled any
      national school girl. The most stupid children at Cocksmoor always seemed
      to them wise in comparison with the Stoneborough girls, and the
      Sunday-school might have become to Ethel a school of rivalry, if Richard
      had not opened her eyes by a quiet observation, that the town girls seemed
      to fare as ill with her, as the Cocksmoor girls did with the town ladies.
      Then she caught herself up, tried to be candid, and found that she was not
      always impartial in her judgments. Why would competition mingle even in
      the best attempts?
    </p>
    <p>
      Cherry did not so bring forward her scholars that Ethel could have many
      triumphs of this dangerous kind. Indeed, Ethel was often vexed with her;
      for though she taught needlework admirably, and enforced correct reading,
      and reverent repetition, her strong provincial dialect was a
      stumbling-block; she could not put questions without book, and nothing
      would teach her Ethel&rsquo;s rational system of arithmetic. That she was a
      capital dame, and made the children very good, was allowed; but now and
      then, when mortified by hearing what was done at Stoneborough, Fordholm,
      or Abbotstoke, Ethel would make vigorous efforts, which resulted only in
      her coming home fuming at Cherry&rsquo;s &ldquo;outrageous dullness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These railings always hurt Margaret, who had made Cherry almost into a
      friend, and generally liked to have a visit from her during the Sunday,
      when she always dined with the servants. Then school questions, Cocksmoor
      news, and the tempers of the children, were talked over, and Cherry was
      now and then drawn into home reminiscences, and descriptions of the ways
      of her former school. There was no fear of spoiling her&mdash;notice from
      her superiors was natural to her, and she had the lady-likeness of womanly
      goodness, so as never to go beyond her own place. She had had many trials
      too, and Margaret learned the true history of them, as she won Cherry&rsquo;s
      confidence, and entered into them, feeling their likeness, yet
      dissimilarity, to her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cherry had been a brisk happy girl in a good place, resting in one of the
      long engagements that often extend over half the life of a servant,
      enjoying the nod of her baker as he left his bread, and her walk from
      church with him on alternate Sundays. But poor Cherry had been exposed to
      the perils of window-cleaning; and, after a frightful fall, had wakened to
      find herself in a hospital, and her severe sufferings had left her a
      cripple for life.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the baker had not been an Alan Ernescliffe! She did not complain of
      him&mdash;he had come to see her, and had been much grieved, but she had
      told him she could never be a useful wife; and, before she had used her
      crutches, he was married to her pretty fellow-servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cherry spoke very simply; she hoped it was better for Long, and believed
      Susan would make him a good wife. Ethel would have thought she did not
      feel, but Margaret knew better.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stroked the thin slight fingers, and gently said, &ldquo;Poor Cherry!&rdquo; and
      Cherry wiped away a tear, and said, &ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am, thank you, it is best for
      him. I should not have wished him to grieve for what cannot be helped.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Resignation is the great comfort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am. I have a great deal to be thankful for. I don&rsquo;t blame no one,
      but I do see how some, as are married, seem to get to think more of this
      world; and now and then I fancy I can see how it is best for me as it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret sighed, as she remembered certain thoughts before Alan&rsquo;s return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, ma&rsquo;am, there has been such goodness! I did vex at being a poor
      helpless thing, nothing but a burden on father; and when we had to go from
      home, and Mr. and Mrs. Hazlewood and all, I can&rsquo;t tell you how bad it was,
      ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you are comforted now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Cherry, brightening. &ldquo;It seems as if He had given me
      something to do, and there are you, and Mr. Richard, and Miss Ethel, to
      help. I should like, please God, to be of some good to those poor
      children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure you will, Cherry; I wish I could do as much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cherry&rsquo;s tears had come again. &ldquo;Ah! ma&rsquo;am, you&mdash;&rdquo; and she stopped
      short, and rose to depart. Margaret held out her hand to wish her
      good-bye. &ldquo;Please, miss, I was thinking how Mr. Hazlewood said that God
      fits our place to us, and us to our place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Cherry, you are leaving me something to remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Margaret lay questioning with herself, whether the schoolmistress had
      not been the most self-denying of the two; but withal gazing on the hoop
      of pearls which Alan had chosen as the ring of betrothal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pearl of great price,&rdquo; murmured she to herself; &ldquo;if we hold that, the
      rest will soon matter but little. It remaineth that both they that have
      wives, be as they that have none, and they that weep, as though they wept
      not, and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not! If ever Alan and
      I have a home together upon earth, may all too confident joy be tempered
      by the fears that we have begun with! I hope this probation may make me
      less likely to be taken up with the cares and pleasures of his position
      than I might have been last year. He is one who can best help the mind to
      go truly upward. But oh, that voyage!&rdquo;

    <p>
      &ldquo;What a bore!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here has this old fellow asked me to dinner again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fine pass we are come to!&rdquo; cried Dr. May, half amused, half irate. &ldquo;I
      should like to know what I should have said at your age if the head-master
      had asked me to dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa is not so very fond of dining at Dr. Hoxton&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;A
      whipper-snapper schoolboy, who might be thankful to dine anywhere!&rdquo;
       continued Dr. May, while the girls burst out laughing, and Norman looked
      injured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very ungrateful of Norman,&rdquo; said Flora; &ldquo;I cannot see what he finds
      to complain of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would know,&rdquo; said Norman, &ldquo;if, instead of playing those perpetual
      tunes of yours, you had to sit it out in that perfumy drawing-room,
      without anything to listen to worth hearing. If I have looked over that
      court album once, I have a dozen times, and there is not another book in
      the place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad there is not,&rdquo; said Flora. &ldquo;I am quite ashamed to see you for
      ever turning over those old pictures. You cannot guess how stupid you
      look. I wonder Mrs. Hoxton likes to have you,&rdquo; she added, patting his
      shoulders between jest and earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish she would not, then. It is only to escort you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, Norman, you know better,&rdquo; cried Ethel. &ldquo;You know it is for your
      own sake, and to make up for their injustice, that he invites you, or
      Flora either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, Ethel! he gives himself quite airs enough already,&rdquo; said the
      doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa!&rdquo; said Ethel, in vexation, though he gave her a pinch to show it was
      all in good humour, while he went on, &ldquo;I am glad to hear they do leave him
      to himself in a corner. A very good thing too! Where else should a great
      gawky schoolboy be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Safe at home, where I wish he would let me be,&rdquo; muttered Norman, though
      he contrived to smile, and followed Flora out of the room, without
      subjecting himself to the imputation of offended dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel was displeased, and began her defence: &ldquo;Papa, I wish&mdash;&rdquo; and
      there she checked herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! Miss Ethel&rsquo;s bristles up!&rdquo; said her father, who seemed in a somewhat
      mischievous mood of teasing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could you, papa?&rdquo; cried she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could I what, Miss Etheldred?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plague Norman,&rdquo;&mdash;the words would come. &ldquo;Accuse him of airs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate to see young fellows above taking an honour from their elders,&rdquo;
       said Dr. May.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, papa, papa, you know it is no such thing. Dr. Hoxton&rsquo;s parties are
      very dull&mdash;you know they are, and it is not fair on Norman. If he was
      set up and delighted at going so often, then you would call him
      conceited.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Conceit has a good many lurking-places,&rdquo; said Dr. May. &ldquo;It is harder to
      go and be overlooked, than to stay at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, papa, you are not to call Norman conceited,&rdquo; cried Ethel. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
      believe that he is any such thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, not exactly,&rdquo; said Dr. May, smiling. &ldquo;The boy has missed it
      marvellously; but, you see, he has everything that subtle imp would wish
      to feed upon, and it is no harm to give him a lick with the rough side of
      the tongue, as your canny Scots grandfather used to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! if you knew, papa&mdash;&rdquo; began Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I knew?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, I must not tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, a secret, is there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish it was not; I should like to tell you very much, but then, you
      see, it is Norman&rsquo;s, and you are to be surprised.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your surprise is likely to be very much like Blanche&rsquo;s birthday presents,
      a stage aside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I am going to keep it to myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two or three days after, as Ethel was going to the schoolroom after
      breakfast, Dr. May beckoned her back to the dining-room, and, with his
      merry look of significance, said, &ldquo;Well, ma&rsquo;am, I have found out your
      mystery!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About Norman? Oh, papa! Did he tell you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I came home from the hospital last night, at an hour when all
      respectable characters, except doctors and police, should be in their warm
      beds, I beheld a light in Norman&rsquo;s window, so methought I would see what
      Gravity was doing out of his bed at midnight&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you found him at his Greek&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that was the meaning of his looking so lank and careworn, just as he
      did last year, and he the prince of the school! I could have found it in
      my heart to fling the books at his head!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you consent, don&rsquo;t you, to his going up for the scholarship?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I consent to anything, as long as he keeps within due bounds, and does
      not work himself to death. I am glad of knowing it, for now I can put a
      moderate check upon it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And did he tell you all about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He told me he felt as if he owed it to us to gain something for himself,
      since I had given up the Randall to gratify him&mdash;a pretty sort of
      gratification.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and he will be glad to get away from school. He says he knows it is
      bad for him&mdash;as it is uncomfortable to be singled out in the way Dr.
      Hoxton does now. You know,&rdquo; pleaded Ethel, &ldquo;it is not ingratitude or
      elation, but it is, somehow, not nice to be treated as he is, set apart
      from the rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True; Dr. Hoxton never had taste or judgment. If Norman were not a lusus
      naturae,&rdquo; said Dr. May, hesitating for a word, &ldquo;his head would have been
      turned long ago. And he wants companions too&mdash;he has been forced out
      of boyhood too soon, poor fellow&mdash;and Harry gone too. He does not get
      anything like real relaxation, and he will be better among youths than
      boys. Stoneborough will never be what it was in my time!&rdquo; added the doctor
      mournfully. &ldquo;I never thought to see the poor old place come to this; but
      there&mdash;when all the better class send their sons to the great public
      schools, and leave nothing but riff-raff here, one is forced, for a boy&rsquo;s
      own sake, to do the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am so glad! Then you have consented to the rest of Norman&rsquo;s scheme,
      and will not keep poor little Tom at school here without him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By what he tells me it would be downright ruin to the boy. I little
      thought to have to take a son of mine away from Stoneborough; but Norman
      is the best judge, and he is the only person who seems to have made any
      impression on Tom, so I shall let it be. In fact,&rdquo; he added, half smiling,
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I could refuse old June.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; cried Ethel. &ldquo;That is so nice! Then, if Norman gets the
      scholarship, Tom is to go to Mr. Wilmot first, and then to Eton!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Norman gains the scholarship, but that is an if,&rdquo; said Dr. May, as
      though hoping for a loop-hole to escape offending the shade of Bishop
      Whichcote.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, papa, you cannot doubt of that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot tell, Ethel. He is facile princeps here in his own world, but we
      do not know how it may be when he is measured with public schoolmen, who
      have had more first-rate tutorship than poor old Hoxton&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! he says so, but I thought that was all his humility.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better he should be prepared. If he had had all those advantages&mdash;but
      it may be as well after all. I always had a hankering to have sent him to
      Eton, but your dear mother used to say it was not fair on the others. And
      now, to see him striving in order to give the advantage of it to his
      little brother! I only hope Master Thomas is worthy of it&mdash;but it is
      a boy I can&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; said Ethel; &ldquo;he never seems to say anything he can help, and goes
      after Norman without talking to any one else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I give him up to Norman&rsquo;s management,&rdquo; said Dr. May. &ldquo;He says the boy is
      very clever, but I have not seen it; and, as to more serious matters&mdash;However,
      I must take it on Norman&rsquo;s word that he is wishing to learn truth. We made
      an utter mistake about him; I don&rsquo;t know who is to blame for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you told Margaret about Norman&rsquo;s plan?&rdquo; asked Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; he desired me to say nothing. Indeed, I should not like Tom&rsquo;s leaving
      school to be talked of beforehand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Norman said he did not want Flora to hear, because she is so much with
      the Hoxton&rsquo;s, and he said they would all watch him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, ay, and we must keep his secret. What a boy it is! But it is not safe
      to say conceited things. We shall have a fall yet, Ethel. Not seventeen,
      remember, and brought up at a mere grammar-school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we shall still have the spirit that made him try,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;and
      that is the thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, to tell the truth,&rdquo; said the doctor, lingering, &ldquo;for my own part, I
      don&rsquo;t care a rush for it!&rdquo; and he dashed off to his work, while Ethel
      stood laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa was so very kind,&rdquo; said Norman tremulously, when Ethel followed him
      to his room, to congratulate him on having gained his father&rsquo;s assent, of
      which he had been more in doubt than she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you see he quite approves of the scheme for Tom, except for thinking
      it disrespect to Bishop Whichcote. He said he only hoped Tom was worthy of
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom!&rdquo; cried Norman. &ldquo;Take my word for it, Ethel, Tom will surprise you
      all. He will beat us all to nothing, I know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If only he can be cured of&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will,&rdquo; said Norman, &ldquo;when once he has outgrown his frights, and that
      he may do at Mr. Wilmot&rsquo;s, apart from those fellows. When I go up for this
      scholarship, you must look after his lessons, and see if you are not
      surprised at his construing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you go. It will be in a month!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has told no one, I hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but I hardly think he will bear not telling Margaret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;I hate a thing being out of one&rsquo;s own keeping. I should not so
      much dislike Margaret&rsquo;s knowing, but I won&rsquo;t have Flora know&mdash;mind
      that, Ethel,&rdquo; he said, with disproportionate vehemence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only hope Flora will not be vexed. But oh, dear! how nice it will be
      when you have it, telling Meta Rivers, and all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this is a fine way of getting it, standing talking here. Not that I
      shall&mdash;you little know what public schools can do! But that is no
      reason against trying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, then. Only one thing more. You mean that, till further
      orders, Margaret should not know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Norman impatiently. &ldquo;She won&rsquo;t take any of Flora&rsquo;s silly
      affronts, and, what is more, she would not care half so much as before
      Alan Ernescliffe came.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Norman, Norman! I&rsquo;m sure&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it is what they always say. Everybody can&rsquo;t be first, and
      Ernescliffe has the biggest half of her, I can see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure I did not,&rdquo; said Ethel, in a mortified voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course, it always comes of people having lovers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I am sure I won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; exclaimed Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norman went into a fit of laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may laugh, Norman, but I will never let papa or any of you be second
      to any one!&rdquo; she cried vehemently.
    </p>
    <p>
      A brotherly home-truth followed: &ldquo;Nobody asked you, sir, she said!&rdquo; was
      muttered by Norman, still laughing heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Ethel, not in the least offended, &ldquo;I am very ugly, and very
      awkward, but I don&rsquo;t care. There never can be anybody in all the world
      that I shall like half as well as papa, and I am glad no one is ever
      likely to make me care less for him and Cocksmoor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay till you are tried,&rdquo; said Norman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel squeezed up her eyes, curled up her nose, showed her teeth in a
      horrible grimace, and made a sort of snarl: &ldquo;Yah! That&rsquo;s the face I shall
      make at them!&rdquo; and then, with another good-night, ran to her own room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norman was, to a certain extent, right with regard to Margaret&mdash;her
      thoughts and interest had been chiefly engrossed by Alan Ernescliffe, and
      so far drawn away from her own family, that when the Alcestis was
      absolutely gone beyond all reach of letters for the present, Margaret
      could not help feeling somewhat of a void, and as if the home concerns
      were not so entire an occupation for her mind as formerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would fain have thrown herself into them again, but she became
      conscious that there was a difference. She was still the object of her
      father&rsquo;s intense tenderness and solicitude, indeed she could not be
      otherwise, but it came over her sometimes that she was less necessary to
      him than in the first year. He was not conscious of any change, and,
      indeed, it hardly amounted to a change, and yet Margaret, lying inactive
      and thoughtful, began to observe that the fullness of his confidence was
      passing to Ethel. Now and then it would appear that he fancied he had told
      Margaret little matters, when he had really told them to Ethel; and it was
      Ethel who would linger with him in the drawing-room after the others had
      gone up at night, or who would be late at the morning&rsquo;s reading, and
      disarm Miss Winter, by pleading that papa had been talking to her. The
      secret they shared together was, of course, the origin of much of this;
      but also Ethel was now more entirely the doctor&rsquo;s own than Margaret could
      be after her engagement; and there was a likeness of mind between the
      father and daughter that could not but develop more in this year, than in
      all Ethel&rsquo;s life, when she had made the most rapid progress. Perhaps, too,
      the doctor looked on Margaret rather as the authority and mistress of his
      house, while Ethel was more of a playfellow; and thus, without either
      having the least suspicion that the one sister was taking the place of the
      other, and without any actual neglect of Margaret, Ethel was his chief
      companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How excited and anxious Norman looks!&rdquo; said Margaret, one day, when he
      had rushed in at the dinner-hour, asking for his father, and, when he
      could not find him, shouting out for Ethel. &ldquo;I hope there is nothing
      amiss. He has looked thin and worn for some time, and yet his work at
      school is very easy to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish there maybe nothing wrong there again,&rdquo; said Flora. &ldquo;There!
      there&rsquo;s the front door banging! He is off! Ethel!&mdash;&rdquo; stepping to the
      door, and calling in her sister, who came from the street door, her hair
      blowing about with the wind. &ldquo;What did Norman want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only to know whether papa had left a note for Dr. Hoxton,&rdquo; said Ethel,
      looking very confused and very merry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was not all,&rdquo; said Flora. &ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t be absurd, Ethel&mdash;I hate
      mysteries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Last time I had a secret you would not believe it,&rdquo; said Ethel, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; exclaimed Flora, &ldquo;why cannot you tell us at once what is going
      on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I was desired not,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;You will hear it soon enough,&rdquo;
       and she capered a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let her alone, Flora,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;I see there is nothing wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she is desired to be silent, there is nothing to be said,&rdquo; replied
      Flora, sitting down again, while Ethel ran away to guard her secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absurd!&rdquo; muttered Flora. &ldquo;I cannot imagine why Ethel is always making
      mysteries!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She cannot help other people having confidence in her,&rdquo; said Margaret
      gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She need not be so important, then,&rdquo; said Flora&mdash;&ldquo;always having
      private conferences with papa! I do not think it is at all fair on the
      rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ethel is a very superior person,&rdquo; said Margaret, with half a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora might toss her head, but she attempted no denial in words. &ldquo;And,&rdquo;
       continued Margaret, &ldquo;if papa does find her his best companion and friend
      we ought to be glad of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not call it just,&rdquo; said Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not think it can be helped,&rdquo; said Margaret: &ldquo;the best must be
      preferred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to that, Ethel is often very ridiculous and silly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is improving every day; and you know dear mamma always thought her
      the finest character amongst us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you are ready to be left out, and have your third sister always put
      before you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Flora, that is not the case. Neither she nor papa would ever be
      unfair; but, as she would say herself, what they can&rsquo;t help, they can&rsquo;t
      help; and, as she grows older, she must surpass me more and more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you like it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like it&mdash;when&mdash;when I think of papa, and of his dear, noble
      Ethel. I do like it, when I am not selfish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret turned away her head, but presently looked up again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only, Flora,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;pray do not say one word of this, on any
      account, to Ethel. She is so happy with papa, and I would not for anything
      have her think I feel neglected, or had any jealousy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; thought Flora, &ldquo;you can give up sweetly, but you have Alan to fall
      back upon. Now I, who certainly have the best right, and a great deal more
      practical sense&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flora took Margaret&rsquo;s advice, and did not reproach Ethel, for a little
      reflection convinced her that she should make a silly figure in so doing,
      and she did not like altercations.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the same evening that Norman came in from school with his hands
      full of papers, and, with one voice, his father and Ethel exclaimed, &ldquo;You
      have them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes;&rdquo; and he gave the letter to his father, while Blanche, who had a very
      inquisitive pair of eyes, began to read from a paper he placed on the
      table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Norman Walter, son of Richard and Margaret May, High Street, Doctor of
      Medicine, December 21st, 18&mdash;. Thomas Ramsden.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that for, Norman?&rdquo; and, as he did not attend, she called Mary to
      share her speculations, and spell out the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; cried Dr. May, &ldquo;this is capital! The old doctor seems not to know
      how to say enough for you. Have you read it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he only told me he had said something in my favour, and wished me all
      success.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Success!&rdquo; cried Mary. &ldquo;Oh, Norman, you are not going to sea too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; interposed Blanche knowingly&mdash;&ldquo;he is going to be married. I
      heard nurse wish her brother success when he was going to marry the
      washerwoman with a red face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mary, &ldquo;people never are married till they are twenty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I tell you,&rdquo; persisted Blanche, &ldquo;people always write like this, in a
      great book in church, when they are married. I know, for we always go into
      church with Lucy and nurse when there is a wedding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Norman, I wish you success with the bride you are to court,&rdquo; said
      Dr. May, much diverted with the young ladies&rsquo; conjectures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But is it really?&rdquo; said Mary, making her eyes as round as full moons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it really?&rdquo; repeated Blanche. &ldquo;Oh, dear! is Norman going to be
      married? I wish it was to be Meta Rivers, for then I could always ride her
      dear little white pony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell them,&rdquo; whispered Norman, a good deal out of countenance, as he
      leaned over Ethel, and quitted the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel cried, &ldquo;Now then!&rdquo; and looked at her father, while Blanche and Mary
      reiterated inquiries&mdash;marriage, and going to sea, being the only
      events that, in their imagination, the world could furnish. Going to try
      for a Balliol scholarship! It was a sad falling off, even if they
      understood what it meant. The doctor&rsquo;s explanations to Margaret had a tone
      of apology for having kept her in ignorance, and Flora said few words, but
      felt herself injured; she had nearly gone to Mrs. Hoxton that afternoon,
      and how strange it would have been if anything had been said to her of her
      own brother&rsquo;s projects, when she was in ignorance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel slipped away to her brother, who was in his own room, surrounded
      with books, flushed and anxious, and trying to glance over each subject on
      which he felt himself weak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall fail! I know I shall!&rdquo; was his exclamation. &ldquo;I wish I had never
      thought of it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? did Dr. Hoxton think you not likely to succeed?&rdquo; cried Ethel, in
      consternation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! he said I was certain, but what is that? We Stoneborough men only
      compare ourselves with each other. I shall break down to a certainty, and
      my father will be disappointed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will do your best?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that. My best will all go away when it comes to the point.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely not. It did not go away last time you were examined, and why
      should it now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you, Ethel, you know nothing about it. I have not got up half what
      I meant to have done. Here, do take this book&mdash;try me whether I know
      this properly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So they went on, Ethel doing her best to help and encourage, and Norman in
      an excited state of restless despair, which drove away half his senses and
      recollection, and his ideas of the superior powers of public schoolboys
      magnifying every moment. They were summoned downstairs to prayers, but
      went up again at once, and more than an hour subsequently, when their
      father paid one of his domiciliary visits, there they still were, with
      their Latin and Greek spread out, Norman trying to strengthen all doubtful
      points, but in a desperate desultory manner, that only confused him more
      and more, till he was obliged to lay his head down on the table, shut his
      eyes, and run his fingers through his hair, before he could recollect the
      simplest matter; his renderings alternated with groans, and, cold as was
      the room, his cheeks and brow were flushed and burning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor checked all this, by saying, gravely and sternly, &ldquo;This is not
      right, Norman. Where are all your resolutions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall never do it. I ought never to have thought of it! I shall never
      succeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What if you do not?&rdquo; said Dr. May, laying his hand on his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? why, Tom&rsquo;s chance lost&mdash;you will all be mortified,&rdquo; said
      Norman, hesitating in some confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will take care of Tom,&rdquo; said Dr. May.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he will have been foiled!&rdquo; said Ethel
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy and girl were both silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you striving for mere victory&rsquo;s sake, Norman?&rdquo; continued his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought not,&rdquo; murmured Norman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Successful or not, you will have done your utmost for us. You would not
      lose one jot of affection or esteem, and Tom shall not suffer. Is it worth
      this agony?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it is foolish,&rdquo; said Norman, with trembling voice, almost as if he
      could have burst into tears. He was quite unnerved by the anxiety and toil
      with which he had overtasked himself, beyond his father&rsquo;s knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, papa!&rdquo; pleaded Ethel, who could not bear to see him pained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is foolish,&rdquo; continued Dr. May, who felt it was the moment for bracing
      severity. &ldquo;It is rendering you unmanly. It is wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Ethel made an exclamation of entreaty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is wrong, I know,&rdquo; repeated Norman; &ldquo;but you don&rsquo;t know what it is to
      get into the spirit of the thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I do not?&rdquo; said the doctor; &ldquo;I can tell exactly what you
      feel now. If I had not been an idle dog, I should have gone through it all
      many more times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall I do?&rdquo; asked Norman, in a worn-out voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put all this out of your mind, sleep quietly, and don&rsquo;t open another
      book.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norman moved his head, as if sleep were beyond his power.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will read you something to calm your tone,&rdquo; said Dr. May, and he took
      up a Prayer-book. &ldquo;&lsquo;Know ye not, that they which run in a race, run all,
      but one receiveth the prize? So run that ye may obtain. And every man that
      striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to
      obtain a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible.&rsquo; And, Norman, that is
      not the struggle where the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the
      strong; nor the contest, where the conqueror only wins vanity and vexation
      of spirit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norman had cast down his eyes, and hardly made answer, but the words had
      evidently taken effect. The doctor only further bade him good-night, with
      a whispered blessing, and, taking Ethel by the hand, drew her away. When
      they met the next morning, the excitement had passed from Norman&rsquo;s manner,
      but he looked dejected and resigned. He had made up his mind to lose, and
      was not grateful for good wishes; he ought never to have thought, he said,
      of competing with men from public schools, and he knew his return of love
      of vain-glory deserved that he should fail. However, he was now calm
      enough not to be likely to do himself injustice by nervousness, and
      Margaret hid hopes that Richard&rsquo;s steady equable mind would have a
      salutary influence. So, commending Tom&rsquo;s lessons to Ethel, and hearing,
      but not marking, countless messages to Richard, he set forth upon his
      emprise, while his anxiety seemed to remain as a legacy for those at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Dr. May confessed that his practice by no means agreed with his
      precept, for he could think of nothing else, and was almost as bad as
      Norman, in his certainty that the boy would fail from mere nervousness.
      Margaret was the better companion for him now, attaching less intensity of
      interest to Norman&rsquo;s success than did Ethel; she was the more able to
      compose him, and cheer his hopes.

      CHAPTER XXX.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Weary soul, and burdened sore,
       Labouring with thy secret load,
     Fear not all thy griefs to pour
       In this heart, love&rsquo;s true abode.
                                   Lyra Innocentium.
</pre>
    <p>
      Tea had just been brought in on the eighth evening from Norman&rsquo;s
      departure, when there was a ring at the bell. There was a start, and look
      of expectation. &ldquo;Only a patient,&rdquo; said the doctor; but it surely was not
      for that reason that he rose with so much alacrity and opened the door,
      nor was &ldquo;Well, old fellow?&rdquo; the greeting for his patients&mdash;so
      everybody sprang after him, and beheld something tall taking off a coat,
      while a voice said, &ldquo;I have got it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mass of children rushed back to Margaret, screaming, &ldquo;He has got it!&rdquo;
       and then Aubrey trotted out into the hall again to see what Norman had
      got.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A happy face at least,&rdquo; said Margaret, as he came to her. And that was
      not peculiar to Norman. The radiance had shone out upon every one in that
      moment, and it was one buzz of happy exclamation, query, and answer&mdash;the
      only tone of regret when Mary spoke of Harry, and all at once took up the
      strain&mdash;how glad poor Harry would be. As to the examination, that had
      been much less difficult than Norman had expected; in fact, he said, it
      was lucky for him that the very subjects had been chosen in which he was
      most up&mdash;luck which, as the doctor could not help observing,
      generally did attend Norman. And Norman had been so happy with Richard;
      the kind, wise elder brother had done exactly what was best for him in
      soothing his anxiety, and had fully shared his feelings, and exulted in
      his success. Margaret had a most triumphant letter, dwelling on the
      abilities of the candidates whom Norman had outstripped, and the idea that
      every one had conceived of his talent. &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; wrote Richard, &ldquo;I fancy
      the men had never believed that I could have a clever brother. I am glad
      they have seen what Norman can do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret could not help reading this aloud, and it made Norman blush with
      the compunction that Richard&rsquo;s unselfish pride in him always excited. He
      had much to tell of his ecstasy with Oxford. Stoneborough Minster had been
      a training in appreciation of its hoary beauty, but the essentially
      prosaic Richard had never prepared him for the impression that the
      reverend old university made on him, and he was already, heart and soul,
      one of her most loyal and loving sons, speaking of his college and of the
      whole university as one who had a right of property in them, and looking,
      all the time, not elated, but contented, as if he had found his sphere and
      was satisfied. He had seen Cheviot, too, and had been very happy in the
      renewed friendship; and had been claimed as a cousin by a Balliol man, a
      certain Norman Ogilvie, a name well known among the Mays. &ldquo;And how has Tom
      been getting on?&rdquo; he asked, when he returned to home affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;He will not have my help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not let you help him!&rdquo; exclaimed Norman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. He says he wants no girls,&rdquo; said Ethel, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Foolish fellow!&rdquo; said Norman. &ldquo;I wonder what sort of work he has made!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very funny, I should think,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;judging by the verses I could
      see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little, pale, rough-haired Tom, in his perpetual coating of dust,
      softly crept into the room, as if he only wanted to elude observation; but
      Mary and Blanche were at once vociferating their news in his ears, though
      with little encouragement&mdash;he only shook them off abruptly, and would
      not answer when they required him to be glad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norman stretched out his arm, intercepting him as he was making for his
      hiding-place behind Dr. May&rsquo;s arm-chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, August, how have things gone on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thirteenth!&rdquo; muttered Tom in his throat, and well he might, for two or
      three voices cried out that was too bad, and that it was all his own
      fault, for not accepting Ethel&rsquo;s help. He took little heed, but crept to
      his corner without another word, and Mary knew she should be thumped if
      she should torment him there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norman left him alone, but the coldness of the little brother for whom he
      had worked gave a greater chill to his pleasure than he could have
      supposed possible. He would rather have had some cordiality on Tom&rsquo;s part,
      than all the congratulations that met him the next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not rest contented while Tom continued to shrink from him, and he
      was the more uneasy when, on Saturday morning, no calls from Mary availed
      to find the little boy, and bring him to the usual reading and Catechism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret decided that they must begin without him, and poor Mary&rsquo;s verse
      was read, in consequence, with a most dolorous tone. As soon as the books
      were shut, she ran off, and a few words passed among the elder ones about
      the truant&mdash;Flora opining that the Andersons had led him away; Ethel
      suggesting that his gloom must arise from his not being well; and Margaret
      looking wistfully at Norman, and saying she feared they had judged much
      amiss last spring. Norman heard in silence, and walked thoughtfully into
      the garden. Presently he caught Mary&rsquo;s voice in expostulation: &ldquo;How could
      you not come to read?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Girls&rsquo; work!&rdquo; growled another voice, out of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Norman, and Richard, and Harry, always come to the reading. Everybody
      ought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norman, who was going round the shrubs that concealed the speakers from
      him, here lost their voices, but, as he emerged in front of the old
      tool-house, he heard a little scream from Mary, and, at the same moment,
      she darted back, and fell over a heap of cabbage-stumps in front of the
      old tool-house. It was no small surprise to her to be raised by him, and
      tenderly asked whether she were hurt. She was not hurt, but she could not
      speak without crying, and when Norman begged to hear what was the matter,
      and where Tom was, she would only plead for him&mdash;that he did not
      intend to hurt her, and that she had been teasing him. What had he done to
      frighten her? Oh! he had only run at her with a hoe, because she was
      troublesome; she did not mind it, and Norman must not&mdash;and she clung
      to him as if to keep him back, while he pursued his researches in the
      tool-house, where, nearly concealed by a great bushel-basket, lurked
      Master Thomas, crouching down, with a volume of Gil Blas in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You here, Tom! What have you hidden yourself here for? What can make you
      so savage to Mary?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She should not bother me,&rdquo; said Tom sulkily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norman sent Mary away, pacifying her by promises that he would not revenge
      her quarrel upon Tom, and then, turning the basket upside down, and
      perching himself astride on it, he began: &ldquo;That is the kindest, most
      forgiving little sister I ever did see. What possesses you to treat her so
      ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t going to hurt her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why drive her away? Why don&rsquo;t you come to read?&rdquo; No answer; and
      Norman, for a moment, felt as if Tom were really hopelessly
      ill-conditioned and sullen, but he persevered in restraining his desire to
      cuff the ill-humour out of him, and continued, &ldquo;Come! there&rsquo;s something
      wrong, and you will never be better till it is out. Tell me&mdash;don&rsquo;t be
      afraid. Those fellows have been at you again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took Tom by the arm to draw him nearer, but a cry and start of pain
      were the result. &ldquo;So they have licked you? Eh? What have they been doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They said they would spiflicate me if I told!&rdquo; sighed Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They shall never do anything to you;&rdquo; and, by-and-by, a sobbing
      confession was drawn forth, muttered at intervals, as low as if Tom
      expected the strings of onions to hear and betray him to his foes. Looking
      on him as a deserter, these town-boys had taken advantage of his brother&rsquo;s
      absence to heap on him every misery they could inflict. There had been a
      wager between Edward Anderson and Sam Axworthy as to what Tom could be
      made to do, and his personal timidity made him a miserable victim, not
      merely beaten and bruised, but forced to transgress every rule of right
      and wrong that had been enforced on his conscience. On Sunday, they had
      profited by the absence of their dux to have a jollification at a little
      public-house, not far from the playing-fields; and here had Tom been
      dragged in, forced to partake with them, and frightened with threats that
      he had treated them all, and was liable to pay the whole bill, which, of
      course, he firmly believed, as well as that he should be at least half
      murdered if he gave his father any suspicion that the whole had not been
      consumed by himself. Now, though poor Tom&rsquo;s conscience had lost many
      scruples during the last spring, the offence, into which he had been
      forced, was too heinous to a child brought up as he had been to be
      palliated even in his own eyes. The profanation of Sunday, and the
      carousal in a public-house, had combined to fill him with a sense of shame
      and degradation, which was the real cause that he felt himself unworthy to
      come and read with his sisters. His grief and misery were extreme, and
      Norman&rsquo;s indignation was such as could find no utterance. He sat silent,
      quivering with anger, and clenching his fingers over the handle of the
      hoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew it!&rdquo; sighed Tom. &ldquo;None of you will ever speak to me again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You! Why, August, man, I have better hopes of you than ever. You are more
      really sorry now than ever you were before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had never been at the Green Man before,&rdquo; said poor Tom, feeling his
      future life stained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never will again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you are gone&mdash;&rdquo; and the poor victim&rsquo;s voice died away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom, you will not stay after me. It is settled that when I go to Balliol,
      you leave Stoneborough, and go to Mr. Wilmot as pupil. Those scamps shall
      never have you in their clutches again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It did not produce the ecstasy Norman had expected. The boy still sat on
      the ground, staring at his brother, as if the good news hardly penetrated
      the gloom; and, after a disappointing silence, recurred to the most
      immediate cause of distress: &ldquo;Eight shillings and tenpence halfpenny!
      Norman, if you would only lend it to me, you shall have all my tin till I
      have made it up&mdash;sixpence a week, and half-a-crown on New Year&rsquo;s
      Day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not going to pay Mr. Axworthy&rsquo;s reckoning,&rdquo; said Norman, rather
      angrily. &ldquo;You will never be better till you have told my father the
      whole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think they will send in the bill to my father?&rdquo; asked Tom, in
      alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed! that is the last thing they will do,&rdquo; said Norman; &ldquo;but I
      would not have you come to him only for such a sneaking reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the girls would hear it. Oh, if I thought Mary and Margaret would
      ever hear it&mdash;Norman, I can&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norman assured him that there was not the slightest reason that these
      passages should ever come to the knowledge of his sisters. Tom was
      excessively afraid of his father, but he could not well be more wretched
      than he was already; and he was brought to assent when Norman showed him
      that he had never been happy since the affair of the blotting-paper, when
      his father&rsquo;s looks and tones had become objects of dread to his guilty
      conscience. Was not the only means of recovering a place in papa&rsquo;s esteem
      to treat him with confidence?
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom answered not, and would only shudder when his brother took upon him to
      declare that free confession would gain pardon even for the doings at the
      Green Man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom had grown stupefied and passive, and his sole dependence was on
      Norman, so, at last, he made no opposition when his brother offered to
      conduct him to his father and speak for him. The danger now was that Dr.
      May should not be forthcoming, and the elder brother was as much relieved,
      as the younger was dismayed, to see, through the drawing-room window, that
      he was standing beside Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa, can you come and speak to me,&rdquo; said Norman, &ldquo;at the door?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coming! What now?&rdquo; said the doctor, entering the hall. &ldquo;What, Tom, my
      boy, what is it?&rdquo; as he saw the poor child, white, cold, almost sick with
      apprehension, with every pulse throbbing, and looking positively ill. He
      took the chilly, damp hand, which shook nervously, and would fain have
      withdrawn itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, my dear, let us see what is amiss;&rdquo; and before Tom knew what he was
      doing, he had seated him on his knee, in the arm-chair in the study, and
      was feeling his pulse. &ldquo;There, rest your head! Has it not been aching all
      day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not think he is ill,&rdquo; said Norman; &ldquo;but there is something he thinks
      I had better tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom would fain have been on his feet, yet the support of that shoulder was
      inexpressibly comfortable to his aching temples, and he could not but wait
      for the shock of being roughly shaken and put down. So, as his brother
      related what had occurred, he crouched and trembled more and more on his
      father&rsquo;s breast, till, to his surprise, he found the other arm passed
      round him in support, drawing him more tenderly close.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor little fellow!&rdquo; said Dr. May, trying to look into the drooping
      face, &ldquo;I grieve to have exposed you to such usage as this! I little
      thought it of Stoneborough fellows!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is very sorry,&rdquo; said Norman, much distressed by the condition of the
      culprit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see it&mdash;I see it plainly,&rdquo; said Dr. May. &ldquo;Tommy, my boy, why
      should you tremble when you are with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has been in great dread of your being displeased.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My boy, do you not know how I forgive you?&rdquo; Tom clung round his neck, as
      if to steady himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, papa! I thought you would never&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, you need never have thought so, my boy! What have I done that you
      should fear me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom did not speak, but nestled up to him with more confidence. &ldquo;There!
      that&rsquo;s better! Poor child! what he must have suffered! He was not fit for
      the place! I had thought him looking ill. Little did I guess the cause.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says his head has ached ever since Sunday,&rdquo; said Norman; &ldquo;and I
      believe he has hardly eaten or slept properly since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He shall never be under their power again! Thanks to you, Norman. Do you
      hear that, Tommy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The answer was hardly audible. The little boy was already almost asleep,
      worn out with all he had undergone. Norman began to clear the sofa, that
      they might lay him down, but his father would not hear of disturbing him,
      and, sending Norman away, sat still for more than an hour, until the child
      slowly awoke, and scarcely recalling what had happened, stood up between
      his father&rsquo;s knees, rubbing his eyes, and looking bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are better now, my boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you would be very angry,&rdquo; slowly murmured Tom, as the past
      returned on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, while you are sorry for your faults, and own them freely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I did,&rdquo; said the boy, still half asleep. &ldquo;I did not know you
      would be so kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Tom, I fear it was as much my fault as yours that you did not know
      it. But, my dear, there is a pardon that can give you better peace than
      mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; muttered Tom, looking down&mdash;&ldquo;I think I could say my
      prayers again now, if&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If what, my dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you would help me, as mamma used&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There could be but one response to this speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom was still giddy and unwell, his whole frame affected by the troubles
      of the last week, and Dr. May arranged him on the sofa, and desired him to
      be quiet, offering to send Mary to be his companion. Tom was languidly
      pleased, but renewed his entreaty, that his confession might be a secret
      from his sisters. Dr. May promised, and Mary, quite satisfied at being
      taken into favour, asked no questions, but spent the rest of the morning
      in playing at draughts with him, and in having inflicted on her the
      history of the Bloody Fire King&rsquo;s Ghost&mdash;a work of Tom&rsquo;s imagination,
      which he was wont to extemporise, to the extreme terror of much enduring
      Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Dr. May had called Mary, he next summoned Norman, who found him in
      the hall, putting on his hat, and looking very stern and determined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Norman!&rdquo; said he hastily, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t say a word&mdash;it must be done&mdash;Hoxton
      must hear of this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norman&rsquo;s face expressed utter consternation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not your doing. It is no concern of yours,&rdquo; said Dr. May, walking
      impetuously into the garden. &ldquo;I find my boy ill, broken down, shattered&mdash;it
      is the usage of this crew of fellows&mdash;what right have I to conceal it&mdash;leave
      other people&rsquo;s sons to be so served?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe they did so to Tom out of ill-will to me,&rdquo; said Norman, &ldquo;and
      because they thought he had ratted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! don&rsquo;t argue against it,&rdquo; said Dr. May, almost petulantly. &ldquo;I have
      stood a great deal to oblige you, but I cannot stand this. When it is a
      matter of corruption, base cruelty&mdash;no, Norman, it is not right&mdash;not
      another word!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norman&rsquo;s words had not been many, but he felt a conviction that, in spite
      of the dismay and pain to himself, Dr. May ought to meet with submission
      to his judgment, and he acquiesced by silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; continued the doctor, &ldquo;if they act thus, when your back
      is turned, what is to happen next half? &lsquo;Tis not for Tom&rsquo;s sake, but how
      could we justify it to ourselves, to expose other boys to this usage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Norman, not without a sigh. &ldquo;I suppose it must be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is right,&rdquo; said Dr. May, as if much relieved. &ldquo;I knew you must see
      it in that light. I do not mean to abuse your confidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed,&rdquo; answered Norman warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you see yourself, that where the welfare of so many is at stake, it
      would be wickedness&mdash;yes, wickedness&mdash;to be silent. Could I see
      that little fellow prostrated, trembling in my arms, and think of those
      scamps inflicting the same on other helpless children&mdash;away from
      their homes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see, I see!&rdquo; said Norman, carried along by the indignation and
      tenderness that agitated his father&rsquo;s voice in his vehemence&mdash;&ldquo;it is
      the only thing to be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be sharing the guilt to hide it,&rdquo; said Dr. May.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Norman, still reluctantly. &ldquo;What do you wish me to do?
      You see, as dux, I know nothing about it. It happened while I was away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, true,&rdquo; said his father. &ldquo;You have learned it as brother, not as
      senior boy. Yes, we had better have you out of the matter. It is I who
      complain of their usage of my son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Norman, with gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have not told me the names of these fellows! No, I had best not know
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it might make a difference,&rdquo; hesitated Norman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, I will not hear them. It ought to make none. The fact is the
      same, be they who they may.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor let himself out at the garden gate, and strode off at a rapid
      pace, conscious perhaps, in secret, that if he did not at once yield to
      the impulse of resentment, good nature would overpower the sense of
      justice. His son returned to the house with a heavy sigh, yet honouring
      the generosity that had respected his scruples, when merely his own
      worldly loss was involved, but set them aside when the good of others was
      concerned. By-and-by Dr. May reappeared. The head-master had been
      thoroughly roused to anger, and had begged at once to examine May junior,
      for whom his father was now come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom was quite unprepared for such formidable consequences of his
      confession, and began by piteous tears and sobs, and when these had, with
      some difficulty, been pacified, he proved to be really so unwell and
      exhausted, that his father could not take him to Minster Street, and was
      obliged to leave him to his brother&rsquo;s keeping, while he returned to the
      school.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon this, Dr. Hoxton came himself, and the sisters were extremely excited
      and alarmed by the intelligence that he was in the study with papa and
      Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then away went the gentlemen; and Mary was again called to comfort Tom,
      who, broken down into the mere longing for sympathy, sobbed out all his
      troubles to her, while her eyes expanded more and more in horror, and her
      soft heart giving way, she cried quite as pitifully, and a great deal more
      loudly; and so the other sisters learned the whole, and Margaret was ready
      for her father when he came in, in the evening, harassed and sorrowful.
      His anger was all gone now, and he was excessively grieved at finding that
      the ringleaders, Samuel Axworthy and Edward Anderson, could, in Dr.
      Hoxton&rsquo;s opinion, receive no sentence but expulsion, which was to be
      pronounced on them on Monday.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam Axworthy was the son of a low, uneducated man, and his best chance had
      been the going to this school; but he was of a surly, obstinate temper,
      and showed so little compunction, that even such superabundant kindness as
      Dr. May&rsquo;s could not find compassion for him; especially since it had
      appeared that Tom had been by no means the only victim, and that he had
      often been the promoter of the like malpractices, which many boys were
      relieved to be forced to expose.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Edward Anderson, however, or rather for his mother, Dr. May was very
      sorry, and had even interceded for his pardon; but Dr. Hoxton, though slow
      to be roused, was far less placable than the other doctor, and would not
      hear of anything but the most rigorous justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Mrs. Anderson, with her pride in her children!&rdquo; Flora spoke it with
      a shade of contemptuous pity, but it made her father groan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall never be able to look in her face again! I shall never see that
      boy without feeling that I have ruined him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He needed nobody to do that for him,&rdquo; said Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With every disadvantage!&rdquo; continued Dr. May; &ldquo;unable even to remember his
      father! Why could I not be more patient and forbearing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, papa!&rdquo; was the general cry&mdash;Norman&rsquo;s voice giving decision to
      the sisters&rsquo; exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;the shock may be the best thing for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right, Margaret,&rdquo; said her father. &ldquo;Sometimes such a thing is the first
      that shows what a course of evil really is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are an affectionate family too,&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;and his mother&rsquo;s
      grief may have an effect on him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she does not treat him as an injured hero,&rdquo; said Flora; &ldquo;besides, I
      see no reason for regret. These are but two, and the school is not to be
      sacrificed to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Norman; &ldquo;I believe that Ashe will be able to keep much better
      order without Axworthy. It is much better as it is, but Harry will be very
      sorry to hear it, and I wish this half was over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor Mrs. Anderson! her shower of notes rent the heart of the one doctor,
      but were tossed carelessly aside by the other. On that Sunday, Norman held
      various conversations with his probable successor, Ashe, a gentle,
      well-disposed boy, hitherto in much dread of the post of authority, but
      owning that, in Axworthy&rsquo;s absence, the task would be comparatively easy,
      and that Anderson would probably originate far less mischief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward Anderson himself fell in Norman&rsquo;s way in the street, and was
      shrinking aside, when a word, of not unfriendly greeting, caused him to
      quicken his steps, and say, hesitatingly, &ldquo;I say, how is August?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better, thank you; he will be all right in a day or two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, we would not have bullied him so, if he had not been in such a
      fright at nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not mean it all, but that sort of thing makes a fellow go on,&rdquo;
       continued Edward, hanging down his head, very sorrowful and downcast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it had only been fair bullying; but to take him to that place&mdash;to
      teach him falsehood&mdash;&rdquo; said Norman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward&rsquo;s eyes were full of tears; he almost owned the whole. He had not
      thought of such things, and then Axworthy&mdash;It was more evident from
      manner than words that the boy did repent and was greatly overcome, both
      by his own disgrace and his mother&rsquo;s distress, wishing earnestly to redeem
      his character, and declaring, from the bottom of his heart, that he would
      avoid his former offences. He was emboldened at last to say, with
      hesitation, &ldquo;Could not you speak to Dr. Hoxton for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father has said all he could in your behalf.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edward&rsquo;s eye glanced towards Norman in wonder, as he recollected that the
      Mays must know that a word from him would have saved Norman from unjust
      punishment and the loss of the scholarship, and he said, &ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; and
      turned aside to his own home, with a heavy sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norman took another turn, looked up at the sky, twisted his hands together
      in perplexity, mumbled something about hating to do a thing when it was
      all for no use, and then marched off towards Minster Street, with a pace
      like his father&rsquo;s the day before.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he came forth again from Dr. Hoxton&rsquo;s study, he did not believe that
      his intercession had produced the least effect, and there was a sense of
      vexation at the position which he had assumed. He went home, and said
      nothing on the subject; but when, on Monday, the school was assembled, and
      the judgment announced, it was Axworthy alone whose friends had been
      advised to remove him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anderson received a severe punishment, as did all those who had shared in
      the revel at the Green Man. Even Tom, and another little boy, who had been
      likewise drawn in, were obliged to stay within narrow bounds, and to learn
      heavy impositions; and a stern reprimand and exhortation were given to the
      school collectively. Anderson, who had seen from the window that turn
      towards Minster Street, drew his own conclusions, and was not insensible
      to the generosity that had surpassed his hopes, though to his faltering
      attempt at thanks, Norman replied that he did not believe it was owing to
      him, and never exposed himself to Flora&rsquo;s wonder by declaring at home what
      he had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the last weeks of the half-year passed away with the boys in a subdued,
      but hopeful manner, and the reformation, under Norman&rsquo;s auspices,
      progressed so well, that Ashe might fairly expect to reap the benefit of
      the discipline, established at so much cost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wilmot had looked on, and given his help, but he was preparing to
      leave Stoneborough, and there was great concern at the parting with such a
      friend. Ethel, especially, mourned the loss to Cocksmoor, and, for though
      hers had been the executive part, his had been the head, and he was almost
      equally grieved to go from the newly-begun work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret lamented the loss of her kind counsellor, and the ready hearer of
      her anxieties for the children. Writing could ill supply the place of
      their conversations, and she feared likewise that her father would feel
      the want of his companionship. The promise of visits, and the intercourse
      kept up by Tom&rsquo;s passing to and fro, was the best consolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Margaret had begun to flag, both in strength and spirits, as winter
      approached, but there came a revival in the shape of &ldquo;Ship Letters!&rdquo; Alan
      wrote cheerfully and graphically, with excellent accounts of Harry, who,
      on his side, sent very joyous and characteristic despatches, only wishing
      that he could present Mary with all the monkeys and parrots he had seen at
      Rio, as well as the little ruby-crested humming-birds, that always
      reminded him of Miss Rivers.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the Christmas holidays, Hector Ernescliffe came from Eton, as to a
      home, and was received by Margaret as a sort of especial charge. It was
      pretty to see how he turned to her as something peculiarly his own, and
      would sit on a footstool by her, letting himself be drawn into confidence,
      and dwelling on his brother&rsquo;s past doings, and on future schemes for
      Maplewood. For the rest, he restored to the house the atmosphere of boy,
      which had somewhat departed with Harry. Mary, who had begun to be tamed
      down, ran more wild than ever, to the utter despair of Miss Winter; and
      Tom, now that his connection with the Whichcote foundation was over, and
      he was no more cowed by the sight of his tyrants, came out in a new light.
      He put on his boy-nature, rioted like the rest, acquired colour in his
      cheeks, divested his jacket of perpetual dust, had his hair cut, brushed
      up a crest on his head, and ran about no longer a little abject, but a
      merry lad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel said it was a change from Horrid-locks to Harfagre; Margaret said
      little, but, like her father, she blessed Norman in her heart for having
      given back the boy to his father&rsquo;s confidence, and saved him so far from
      the terrible course of deceit and corruption. She could not much take to
      heart the mad exploits of the so-called boys, even though she spent three
      hours in heart-beatings on Christmas Eve, when Hector, Mary, Tom, Blanche,
      and the dog Toby, were lost the whole day. However, they did come back at
      six o&rsquo;clock, having been deluded by an old myth of George Larkins, into
      starting for a common, three miles beyond Cocksmoor, in search of
      mistletoe, with scarlet berries, and yellow holly, with leaves like a
      porcupine! Failing these wonders, they had been contenting themselves with
      scarlet holly, in the Drydale plantations, when a rough voice exclaimed,
      &ldquo;Who gave you leave to take that?&rdquo; whereupon Tom had plunged into a
      thicket, and nearly &ldquo;scratched out both his eyes&rdquo;; but Hector boldly
      standing his ground, with Blanche in his hand, the woodman discovered that
      here was the Miss Mary, of whom his little girls talked so much, thereupon
      cut down the choicest boughs, and promised to leave a full supply at Dr.
      May&rsquo;s. Margaret could have been angry at the taking the young ladies on so
      mad a scheme, but then Mary was so happy, and as to Hector, how scold him,
      when he had lifted Blanche over every ditch, and had carried her home one
      mile on his back, and another, queen&rsquo;s-cushion fashion, between him and
      Mary?
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora, meanwhile, went her own way. The desire of compensating for what
      had passed with Norman, led to great civilities from Dr. and Mrs. Hoxton,
      which nobody was at liberty to receive except Flora. Pretty, graceful, and
      pleasing, she was a valuable companion to a gentle little, inane lady,
      with more time and money than she knew what to do with; and Mrs. Hoxton,
      who was of a superior grade to the Stoneborough ladies in general, was
      such a chaperon as Flora was glad to secure. Dr. May&rsquo;s old loyal feelings
      could not help regarding her notice of his daughter as a favour and
      kindness, and Margaret could find no tangible objections, nor any
      precedent from her mother&rsquo;s conduct, even had any one had the power to
      interfere with one so quiet, reasonable, and determined as Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the intimacy became closer and closer, and as the winter passed on,
      Flora gradually became established as the dear friend and assistant,
      without whom Mrs. Hoxton could give no party. Further, Flora took the
      grand step of setting up a copper-plate and cards of &ldquo;Miss Flora May,&rdquo;
       went out frequently on morning calls with Mrs. Hoxton and her bay horses,
      and when Dr. May refused his share of invitations to dinner with the
      neighbours in the county, Flora generally found that she could go under
      the Hoxtons&rsquo; guardianship.

    <p>
      &ldquo;That is better!&rdquo; said Margaret, contemplating a butterfly of the penwiper
      class, whose constitution her dexterous needle had been rendering less
      rickety than Blanche had left it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret still lay on the sofa, and her complexion had assumed the dead
      white of habitual ill-health. There was more languor of manner, and her
      countenance, when at rest, and not under the eye of her father, had a
      sadness of expression, as if any hopes that she might once have
      entertained were fading away. The years of Alan Ernescliffe&rsquo;s absence that
      had elapsed had rather taken from her powers than added to them.
      Nevertheless, the habit of cheerfulness and sympathy had not deserted her,
      and it was with a somewhat amused glance that she turned towards Ethel, as
      she heard her answer by a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      These years had dealt more kindly with Etheldred&rsquo;s outward appearance.
      They had rounded her angles, softened her features, and tinged her cheeks
      with a touch of red, that took off from the surrounding sallowness. She
      held herself better, had learned to keep her hair in order, and the more
      womanly dress, plain though it was, improved her figure more than could
      have been hoped in the days of her lank, gawky girlhood. No one could call
      her pretty, but her countenance had something more than ever pleasing in
      the animated and thoughtful expression on those marked features. She was
      sitting near the window, with a book, a dictionary, and pencil, as she
      replied to Margaret, with the sigh that made her sister smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Ethel! I condole with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I wonder at you!&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;especially as Flora and Mrs. Hoxton
      say it is all for your sake;&rdquo; then, nettled by Margaret&rsquo;s laugh, &ldquo;Such a
      nice occupation for her, poor thing, as if you were Mrs. Hoxton, and had
      no resource but fancy-work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know I am base enough to be so amused,&rdquo; said Margaret; &ldquo;but,
      seriously, Ethel dear, I cannot bear to see you so much hurt by it. I did
      not know you were really grieved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grieved! I am ashamed&mdash;sickened!&rdquo; cried Ethel vehemently. &ldquo;Poor
      Cocksmoor! As soon as anything is done there, Flora must needs go about
      implying that we have set some grand work in hand, and want only means&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, Ethel; Flora does not boast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she does not boast. I wish she did! That would be straightforward and
      simple; but she has too good taste for that&mdash;so she does worse&mdash;she
      tells a little, and makes that go a long way, as if she were keeping back
      a great deal! You don&rsquo;t know how furious it makes me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ethel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So,&rdquo; said Ethel, disregarding, &ldquo;she stirs up all Stoneborough to hear
      what the Miss Mays are doing at Cocksmoor. So the Ladies&rsquo; Committee must
      needs have their finger in! Much they cared for the place when it was wild
      and neglected! But they go to inspect Cherry and her school&mdash;Mrs.
      Ledwich and all&mdash;and, back they come, shocked&mdash;no system, no
      order, the mistress untrained, the school too small, with no apparatus!
      They all run about in despair, as if we had ever asked them to help us.
      And so Mrs. Hoxton, who cares for poor children no more than for
      puppy-dogs, but who can&rsquo;t live without useless work, and has filled her
      house as full of it as it can hold, devises a bazaar&mdash;a field for her
      trumpery, and a show-off for all the young ladies; and Flora treats it
      like an inspiration! Off they trot, to the old Assembly Rooms. I trusted
      that the smallness of them would have knocked it on the head; but, still
      worse, Flora&rsquo;s talking of it makes Mr. Rivers think it our pet scheme; so,
      what does he do but offer his park, and so we are to have a regular fancy
      fair, and Cocksmoor School will be founded in vanity and frivolity! But I
      believe you like it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not sure of my own feeling,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;It has been settled
      without our interposition, and I have never been able to talk it over
      calmly with you. Papa does not seem to disapprove.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;He will only laugh, and say it will spare him a great
      many of Mrs. Hoxton&rsquo;s nervous attacks. He thinks of it nearly as I do, at
      the bottom, but I cannot get him to stop it, nor even to say he does not
      wish Flora to sell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not understand that you really had such strong objections,&rdquo; said
      Margaret. &ldquo;I thought it was only as a piece of folly, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And interference with my Cocksmoor?&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;I had better own to
      what may be wrong personal feeling at first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can hardly call it wrong,&rdquo; said Margaret tenderly, &ldquo;considering what
      Cocksmoor is to you, and what the Ladies&rsquo; Committee is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Margaret, if the lawful authority&mdash;if a good clergyman would
      only come, how willingly would I work under him! But Mrs. Ledwich and&mdash;it
      is like having all the Spaniards and savages spoiling Robinson Crusoe&rsquo;s
      desert island!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not come to that yet,&rdquo; said Margaret; &ldquo;but about the fancy fair. We
      all know that the school is very much wanted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but I hoped to wait in patience and perseverance, and do it at
      last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Margaret! you know I was glad of Alan&rsquo;s help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think so!&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;You need not make a favour of that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but, don&rsquo;t you see, that came as almsgiving, in the way which brings
      a blessing. We want nothing to make us give money and work to Cocksmoor.
      We do all we can already; and I don&rsquo;t want to get a fine bag or a
      ridiculous pincushion in exchange!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not you, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, for the rest. If they like to offer their money, well and good, the
      better for them; but why must they not give it to Cocksmoor&mdash;but for
      that unnatural butterfly of Blanche&rsquo;s, with black pins for horns, that
      they will go and sell at an extortionate rate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The price will be given for Cocksmoor&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh! Margaret. Do you think it is for Cocksmoor&rsquo;s sake that Lady Leonora
      Langdale and her fine daughter come down from London? Would Mrs. Hoxton
      spend the time in making frocks for Cocksmoor children that she does in
      cutting out paper, and stuffing glass bottles with it? Let people be
      honest&mdash;alms, or pleasure, or vanity! let them say which they mean;
      but don&rsquo;t make charity the excuse for the others; and, above all, don&rsquo;t
      make my poor Cocksmoor the victim of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is very severe,&rdquo; said Margaret, pausing, almost confounded. &ldquo;Do you
      think no charity worth having but what is given on unmixed motives? Who,
      then, could give?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Margaret&mdash;we see much evil arise in the best-planned institutions;
      nay, in what are not human. Don&rsquo;t you think we ought to do our utmost to
      have no flaw in the foundation? Schools are not such perfect places that
      we can build them without fear, and, if the means are to be raised by a
      bargain for amusement&mdash;if they are to come from frivolity instead of
      self-denial, I am afraid of them. I do not mean that Cocksmoor has not
      been the joy of my life, and of Mary&rsquo;s, but that was not because we did it
      for pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; said Margaret, sighing, &ldquo;you found pleasure by the way. But why did
      you not say all this to Flora?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is of no use to talk to Flora,&rdquo; said Ethel; &ldquo;she would say it was
      high-flown and visionary. Oh! she wants it for the bazaar&rsquo;s own sake, and
      that is one reason why I hate it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Ethel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do believe it was very unfortunate for Flora that the Hoxtons took to
      patronising her, because Norman would not be patronised. Ever since it
      began, her mind has been full of visitings, and parties, and county
      families, and she has left off the home usefulness she used to care
      about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are old enough for that,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;It would be hard to
      keep Flora at home, now that you can take her place, and do not care for
      going out. One of us must be the representative Miss May, you know, and
      keep up the civilities; and you may think yourself lucky it is not you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it was only that, I should not care, but I may as well tell you,
      Margaret, for it is a weight to me. It is not the mere pleasure in
      gaieties&mdash;Flora cares for them, in themselves, as little as I do&mdash;nor
      is it neighbourliness, as a duty to others, for, you may observe, she
      always gets off any engagement to the Wards, or any of the town folk, to
      whom it would be a gratification to have her&mdash;she either eludes them,
      or sends me. The thing is, that she is always trying to be with the great
      people, the county set, and I don&rsquo;t think that is the safe way of going
      on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret mused sadly. &ldquo;You frighten me, Ethel! I cannot say it is not so,
      and these are so like the latent faults that dear mamma&rsquo;s letter spoke of&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel sat meditating, and at last said, &ldquo;I wish I had not told you! I
      don&rsquo;t always believe it myself, and it is so unkind, and you will make
      yourself unhappy too. I ought not to have thought it of her! Think of her
      ever-ready kindness and helpfulness; her pretty courteous ways to the very
      least; her obligingness and tact!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;she is one of the kindest people there is, and I am
      sure that she thought the gaining funds for Cocksmoor was the best thing
      to be done, that you would be pleased, and a great deal of pleasant
      occupation provided for us all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the bright side, the surface side,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And not an untrue one,&rdquo; said Margaret; &ldquo;Meta will not be vain, and will
      work the more happily for Cocksmoor&rsquo;s sake. Mary and Blanche, poor Mrs.
      Boulder, and many good ladies who hitherto have not known how to help
      Cocksmoor, will do so now with a good will, and though it is not what we
      should have chosen, I think we had better take it in good part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed I do. If you go about with that dismal face and strong
      disapproval, it will really seem as if it was the having your dominion
      muddled with that you dislike. Besides, it is putting yourself forward to
      censure what is not absolutely wrong in itself, and that cannot be
      desirable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;but I cannot help being sorry for Cocksmoor. I thought
      patience would prepare the way, and the means be granted in good time,
      without hastiness&mdash;only earnestness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had made a picture for yourself,&rdquo; said Margaret gently. &ldquo;Yes, we all
      make pictures for ourselves, and we are the foremost figures in them; but
      they are taken out of our hands, and we see others putting in rude
      touches, and spoiling our work, as it seems; but, by-and-by, we shall see
      that it is all guided.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel sighed. &ldquo;Then having protested to my utmost against this concern,
      you think I ought to be amiable about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to let poor Mary enjoy it. She would be so happy, if you would not
      bewilder her by your gloomy looks, and keep her to the hemming of your
      endless glazed calico bonnet strings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor old Mary! I thought that was by her own desire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only her dutiful allegiance to you; and, as making pincushions is nearly
      her greatest delight, it is cruel to make her think it, in some mysterious
      way, wrong and displeasing to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel laughed, and said, &ldquo;I did not think Mary was in such awe of me. I&rsquo;ll
      set her free, then. But, Margaret, do you really think I ought to give up
      my time to it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could you not just let them have a few drawings, or a little bit of your
      company work&mdash;just enough for you not to annoy every one, and seem to
      be testifying against them? You would not like to vex Meta.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will go hard, if I do not tell Meta my mind. I cannot bear to see her
      deluded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think she is,&rdquo; said Margaret; &ldquo;but she does not set her face
      against what others wish. As papa says of his dear little humming-bird,
      she takes the honey, and leaves the poison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; amid all that enjoyment, she is always choosing the good, and
      leaving the evil; always sacrificing something, and then being happy in
      the sacrifice!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one would guess it was a sacrifice, it is so joyously done&mdash;least
      of all Meta herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her coming home from London was exactly a specimen of that sacrifice&mdash;and
      no sacrifice,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; said Norman, who had come up to the window unobserved,
      and had been listening to their few last sentences.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did not you hear of it? It was a sort of material turning away from
      vanity that made me respect the little rival Daisy, as much as I always
      admired her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; said Norman. &ldquo;When was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Last spring. You know Mr. Rivers is always ill in London: indeed, papa
      says it would be the death of him; but Lady Leonora Langdale thinks it
      dreadful that Meta should not go to all the gaieties; and last year, when
      Mrs. Larpent was gone, she insisted on her coming to stay with her for the
      season. Now Meta thought it wrong to leave her father alone, and wanted
      not to have gone at all, but, to my surprise, Margaret advised her to
      yield, and go for some short fixed time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Margaret; &ldquo;as all her elders thought it right, I did not think
      we could advise her to refuse absolutely. Besides, it was a promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She declared she would only stay three weeks, and the Langdales were
      satisfied, thinking that, once in London, they should keep her. They
      little knew Meta, with her pretty ways of pretending that her resolution
      is only spoiled-child wilfulness. None of you quite trusted her, did you,
      Margaret? Even papa was almost afraid, though he wanted her very much to
      be at home; for poor Mr. Rivers was so low and forlorn without her, though
      he would not let her know, because Lady Leonora had persuaded him to think
      it was all for her good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did they do with her in London?&rdquo; asked Norman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They did their utmost,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;They made engagements for her, and
      took her to parties and concerts&mdash;those she did enjoy very much and
      she had lessons in drawing and music, but whenever she wanted to see any
      exhibitions, or do anything, they always said there was time to spare. I
      believe it was very charming, and she would have been very glad to stay,
      but she never would promise, and she was always thinking of her positive
      duty at home. She seemed afterwards to think of her wishes to remain
      almost as if they had been a sin; but she said&mdash;dear little Meta&mdash;that
      nothing had ever helped her so much as that she used to say to herself,
      whenever she was going out, &lsquo;I renounce the world.&rsquo; It came to a crisis at
      last, when Lady Leonora wanted her to be presented&mdash;the Drawing-Room
      was after the end of her three weeks&mdash;and she held out against it;
      though her aunt laughed at her, and treated her as if she was a silly, shy
      child. At last, what do you think Meta did? She went to her uncle, Lord
      Cosham, and appealed to him to say whether there was the least necessity
      for her to go to court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then she gained the day?&rdquo; said Norman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was delighted with that spirited, yet coaxing way of hers, and admired
      her determination. He told papa so himself&mdash;for you must know, when
      he heard all Meta had to say, he called her a very good girl, and said he
      would take her home himself on the Saturday she had fixed, and spend
      Sunday at Abbotstoke. Oh! he was perfectly won by her sweet ways. Was not
      it lucky? for before this Lady Leonora had written to Mr. Rivers, and
      obtained from him a letter, which Meta had the next day, desiring her to
      stay for the Drawing-Room. But Meta knew well enough how it was, and was
      not to be conquered that way; so she said she must go home to entertain
      her uncle, and that if her papa really wished it, she would return on
      Monday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Knowing well that Mr. Rivers would be only too glad to keep her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so. How happy they both did look, when they came in here on their
      way from the station where he had met her! How she danced in, and how she
      sparkled with glee!&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;and poor Mr. Rivers was quite
      tremulous with the joy of having her back, hardly able to keep from
      fondling her every minute, and coming again into the room after they had
      taken leave, to tell me that his little girl had preferred her home, and
      her poor old father, to all the pleasures in London. Oh, I was so glad
      they came! That was a sight that did one good! And then, I fancy Mr.
      Rivers is a wee bit afraid of his brother-in-law, for he begged papa and
      Flora to come home and dine with them, but Flora was engaged to Mrs.
      Hoxton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! Flora!&rdquo; said Norman, as if he rather enjoyed her losing something
      through her going to Mrs. Hoxton. &ldquo;I suppose she would have given the
      world to go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was so sorry,&rdquo; said Ethel; &ldquo;but I had to go instead, and it was
      delightful. Papa made great friends with Lord Cosham, while Mr. Rivers
      went to sleep after dinner, and I had such a delightful wandering with
      Meta, listening to the nightingales, and hearing all about it. I never
      knew Meta so well before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there was no more question of her going back?&rdquo; said Norman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed! She said, when her uncle asked in joke, on Monday morning,
      whether she had packed up to return with him, Mr. Rivers was quite
      nervously alarmed the first moment, lest she should intend it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That little Meta,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;Her wishes for substantial use have
      been pretty well realised!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um!&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; said Norman sharply. &ldquo;I should call her present
      position the perfection of feminine usefulness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So perhaps it is,&rdquo; said Ethel; &ldquo;but though she does it beautifully, and
      is very valuable, to be the mistress of a great luxurious house like that
      does not seem to me the subject of aspirations like Meta&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think of the contrast with what she used to be,&rdquo; said Margaret gently,
      &ldquo;the pretty, gentle, playful toy that her father brought her up to be,
      living a life of mere accomplishments and self-indulgence; kind certainly,
      but never so as to endure any disagreeables, or make any exertion. But as
      soon as she entered into the true spirit of our calling, did she not begin
      to seek to live the sterner life, and train herself in duty? The quiet way
      she took always seemed to me the great beauty of it. She makes duties of
      her accomplishments by making them loving obedience to her father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that they are not pleasant to her?&rdquo; interposed Norman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;but it gives them the zest, and confidence
      that they are right, which one could not have in such things merely for
      one&rsquo;s own amusement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;she does more; she told me one day that one reason she
      liked sketching was, that looking into nature always made psalms and hymns
      sing in her ears, and so with her music and her beautiful copies from the
      old Italian devotional pictures. She says our papa taught her to look at
      them so as to see more than the mere art and beauty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think how diligently she measures out her day,&rdquo; said Margaret; &ldquo;getting
      up early, to be sure of time for reading her serious books, and working
      hard at her tough studies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what I care for still more,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;her being bent on learning
      plain needlework and doing it for her poor people. She is so useful
      amongst the cottagers at Abbotstoke!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a famous little mistress of the house,&rdquo; added Margaret. &ldquo;When the old
      housekeeper went away two years ago, she thought she ought to know
      something about the government of the house; so she asked me about it, and
      proposed to her father that the new one should come to her for orders, and
      that she should pay the wages and have the accounts in her hands. Mr.
      Rivers thought it was only a freak, but she has gone on steadily; and I
      assure you, she has had some difficulties, for she has come to me about
      them. Perhaps Ethel does not believe in them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I was only thinking how I should hate ordering those fanciful dinners
      for Mr. Rivers. I know what you mean, and how she had difficulties about
      sending the maids to church, and in dealing with the cook, who did harm to
      the other servants, and yet sent up dinners that he liked, and how puzzled
      she was to avoid annoying him. Oh! she has got into a peck of troubles by
      making herself manager.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And had she not been the Meta she is, she would either have fretted, or
      thrown it all up, instead of humming briskly through all. She never was
      afraid to speak to any one,&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;that is one thing; I believe
      every difficulty makes the spirit bound higher, till she springs over it,
      and finds it, as she says, only a pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She need not be afraid to speak,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;for she always does it
      well and winningly. I have seen her give a reproof in so firm and kind a
      way, and so bright in the instant of forgiveness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;she does those disagreeable things as well as Flora
      does in her way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;doing things well does not seem to be a snare to
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; whispered Margaret, &ldquo;she fulfils more than almost any one&mdash;the&mdash;&lsquo;Whatsoever
      ye do, do all to the glory of God.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; said Norman suddenly, &ldquo;the derivation of Margarita?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No further than those two pretty meanings, the pearl and the daisy,&rdquo; said
      Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is from the Persian Mervarid, child of light,&rdquo; said Norman; and, with
      a sudden flush of colour, he returned to the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fit meaning for one who carries sunshine with her,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;I
      feel in better tune for a whole day after her bright eyes have been
      smiling on me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want no one to put you in tune,&rdquo; said Ethel fondly&mdash;&ldquo;you, our
      own pearl of light.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, call me only an old faded daisy,&rdquo; said Margaret sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit, only our moon, la gran Margarita&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear the real Daisy coming!&rdquo; exclaimed Margaret, her face lighting up
      with pleasure as the two youngest children entered, and, indeed, little
      Gertrude&rsquo;s golden hair, round open face, fresh red and white complexion,
      and innocent looks, had so much likeness to the flower, as to promote the
      use of the pet name, though protests were often made in favour of her
      proper appellation. Her temper was daisy-like too, serene and loving, and
      able to bear a great deal of spoiling, and resolve as they might, who was
      not her slave?
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Winter no longer ruled the schoolroom. Her sway had been brought to a
      happy conclusion by a proposal from a widowed sister to keep house with
      her; and Ethel had reason to rejoice that Margaret had kept her submissive
      under authority, which, if not always judicious, was both kind and
      conscientious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the change, Ethel had thought that the lessons could easily be
      managed by herself and Flora; while Flora was very anxious for a finishing
      governess, who might impart singing to herself, graces to Ethel, and
      accomplishments to Mary and Blanche.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. May, however, took them both by surprise. He met with a family of
      orphans, the eldest of whom had been qualifying herself for a governess,
      and needed nothing but age and finish; and in ten minutes after the
      project had been conceived, he had begun to put it in execution, in spite
      of Flora&rsquo;s prudent demurs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Bracy was a gentle, pleasing young person, pretty to look at, with
      her soft olive complexion, and languid pensive eyes, obliging and
      intelligent; and the change from the dry, authoritative Miss Winter was so
      delightful, that unedifying contrasts were continually being drawn.
      Blanche struck up a great friendship for her at once; Mary, always docile,
      ceased to be piteous at her lessons, and Ethel moralised on the
      satisfaction of having sympathy needed instead of repelled, and did her
      utmost to make Miss Bracy feel at home&mdash;and like a friend&mdash;in
      her new position.
    </p>
    <p>
      For herself, Ethel had drawn up a beautiful time-table, with all her
      pursuits and duties most carefully balanced, after the pattern of that
      which Margaret Rivers had made by her advice, on the departure of Mrs.
      Larpent, who had been called away by the ill-health of her son. Meta had
      adhered to hers in an exemplary manner, but she was her own mistress in a
      manner that could hardly be the lot of one of a large family.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret had become subject to languor and palpitations, and the head of
      the household had fallen entirely upon Flora, who, on the other hand, was
      a person of multifarious occupations, and always had a great number of
      letters to write, or songs to copy and practise, which, together with her
      frequent visits to Mrs. Hoxton, made her glad to devolve, as much as she
      could, upon her younger sister; and, &ldquo;Oh, Ethel, you will not mind just
      doing this for me,&rdquo; was said often enough to be a tax upon her time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, Ethel perceived that Aubrey&rsquo;s lessons were in an unsatisfactory
      state. Margaret could not always attend to them, and suffered from them
      when she did; and he was bandied about between his sisters and Miss Bracy
      in a manner that made him neither attentive nor obedient.
    </p>
    <p>
      On her own principle, that to embrace a task heartily renders it no longer
      irksome, she called on herself to sacrifice her studies and her
      regularity, as far as was needful, to make her available for home
      requirements. She made herself responsible for Aubrey, and, after a few
      battles with his desultory habits, made him a very promising pupil,
      inspiring so much of herself into him, that he was, if anything, overfull
      of her classical tastes. In fact, he had such an appetite for books, and
      dealt so much in precocious wisdom, that his father was heard to say, &ldquo;Six
      years old! It is a comfort that he will soon forget the whole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gertrude was also Ethel&rsquo;s pupil, but learning was not at all in her line;
      and the sight of &ldquo;Cobwebs to catch Flies,&rdquo; or of the venerated &ldquo;Little
      Charles,&rdquo; were the most serious clouds, that made the Daisy pucker up her
      face, and infuse a whine into her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, to-day, as usual, she was half dragged, half coaxed, through her
      day&rsquo;s portion of the discipline of life, and then sent up for her sleep,
      while Aubrey&rsquo;s two hours were spent in more agreeable work, such as
      Margaret could not but enjoy hearing&mdash;so spirited was Ethel&rsquo;s mode of
      teaching&mdash;so eager was her scholar.
    </p>
    <p>
      His play afterwards consisted in fighting o&rsquo;er again the siege of Troy on
      the floor, with wooden bricks, shells, and the survivors of a Noah&rsquo;s ark,
      while Ethel read to Margaret until Gertrude&rsquo;s descent from the nursery,
      when the only means of preventing a dire confusion in Aubrey&rsquo;s camp was
      for her elder sisters to become her playfellows, and so spare Aubrey&rsquo;s
      temper. Ethel good-humouredly gave her own time, till their little tyrant
      trotted out to make Norman carry her round the garden on his back.
    </p>
    <p>
      So sped the morning till Flora came home, full of the intended bazaar, and
      Ethel would fain have taken refuge in puzzling out her Spanish, had she
      not remembered her recent promise to be gracious.
    </p>
    <p>
      The matter had been much as she had described it. Flora had a way of
      hinting at anything she thought creditable, and thus the Stoneborough
      public had become aware of the exertions of the May family on behalf of
      Cocksmoor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plan of a fancy fair was started. Mrs. Hoxton became more interested
      than was her wont, and Flora was enchanted at the opening it gave for
      promoting the welfare of the forlorn district. She held a position which
      made her hope to direct the whole. As she had once declared, with truth,
      it only had depended on themselves, whether she and her sisters should
      sink to the level of the Andersons and their set, or belong to the county
      society; and her tact had resulted in her being decidedly&mdash;as the
      little dressmaker&rsquo;s apprentice amused Ethel by saying&mdash;&ldquo;One of our
      most distinguished patronesses&rdquo;&mdash;a name that had stuck by her ever
      since.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret looked on passively, inclined to admire Flora in everything, yet
      now and then puzzled; and her father, in his simple-hearted way, felt only
      gratitude and exultation in the kindness that his daughter met with. As to
      the bazaar, if it had been started in his own family, he might have
      weighed the objections, but, as it was not his daughter&rsquo;s own concern, he
      did not trouble himself about it, only regarding it as one of the many
      vagaries of the ladies of Stoneborough.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the scheme had been further developed, till now Flora came in with much
      to tell. The number of stalls had been finally fixed. Mrs. Hoxton
      undertook one, with Flora as an aide-de-camp, and some nieces to assist;
      Lady Leonora was to chaperon Miss Rivers; and a third, to Flora&rsquo;s regret,
      had been allotted to Miss Cleveland, a good-natured, merry, elderly
      heiress, who would, Flora feared, bring on them the whole &ldquo;Stoneborough
      crew.&rdquo; And then she began to reckon up the present resources&mdash;drawings,
      bags, and pincushions. &ldquo;That chip hat you plaited for Daisy, Margaret, you
      must let us have that. It will be lovely, trimmed with pink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you wish for this?&rdquo; said Ethel, heaving up a mass of knitting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Flora; &ldquo;so ornamental, especially the original
      performance in the corner, which you would perpetrate, in spite of my best
      efforts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not be offended if you despise it. I only thought you might have
      no more scruple in robbing Granny Hall than in robbing Daisy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, send it. Papa will buy it as your unique performance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; you shall tell me what I am to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does she mean it?&rdquo; said Flora, turning to Margaret. &ldquo;Have you converted
      her? Well done! Then, Ethel, we will get some pretty batiste, and you and
      Mary shall make some of those nice sun-bonnets, which you really do to
      perfection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. That is a more respectable task than I expected. People may
      have something worth buying,&rdquo; said Ethel, who, like all the world, felt
      the influence of Flora&rsquo;s tact.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean to study the useful,&rdquo; said Flora. &ldquo;The Cleveland set will be sure
      to deal in frippery, and I have been looking over Mrs. Hoxton&rsquo;s stores,
      where I see quite enough for mere decoration. There are two splendid vases
      in potichomanie, in an Etruscan pattern, which are coming for me to
      finish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Taylor, at Cocksmoor, could do that for you,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;Her two
      phials, stuffed with chintz patterns and flour, are quite as original and
      tasteful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silly work,&rdquo; said Flora, &ldquo;but it makes a fair show.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The essence of Vanity Fair,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do to be satirical over much,&rdquo; said Flora. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t get on
      without humouring your neighbours&rsquo; follies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to get on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you want&mdash;or, at least, I want&mdash;Cocksmoor to get on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel saw Margaret looking distressed, and, recalling her resolution she
      said, &ldquo;Well, Flora, I don&rsquo;t mean to say any more about it. I see it can&rsquo;t
      be helped, and you all think you intend it for good; so there&rsquo;s an end of
      the matter, and I&rsquo;ll do anything for you in reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor old King Ethel!&rdquo; said Flora, smiling in an elder-sisterly manner.
      &ldquo;You will see, my dear, your views are very pretty, but very
      impracticable, and it is a work-a-day world after all&mdash;even papa
      would tell you so. When Cocksmoor school is built, then you may thank me.
      I do not look for it before.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER II.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Knowledge is second, not the first;
     A higher Hand must make her mild,
     If all be not in vain, and guide
     Her footsteps, moving side by side,
     With wisdom; like the younger child,
     For she is earthly of the mind,
     But knowledge heavenly of the soul.&mdash;In Memoriam.
</pre>
    <p>
      Etheldred had not answered her sister, but she did not feel at all secure
      that she should have anything to be thankful for, even if the school were
      built.
    </p>
    <p>
      The invasion of Cocksmoor was not only interference with her own field of
      action, but it was dangerous to the improvement of her scholars. Since the
      departure of Mr. Wilmot, matters at Stoneborough National School had not
      improved, though the Misses Anderson talked a great deal about progress,
      science, and lectures.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Ladies&rsquo; Committee were constantly at war with the mistresses, and that
      one was a veteran who endured them, or whom they could endure beyond her
      first half-year. No mistress had stayed a year within the memory of any
      girl now at school. Perpetual change prevented any real education, and, as
      each lady held different opinions and proscribed all books not agreeing
      thereto, everything &ldquo;dogmatical&rdquo; was excluded; and, as Ethel said, the
      children learned nothing but facts about lions and steam-engines, while
      their doctrine varied with that of the visitor for the week. If the ten
      generals could only have given up to Miltiades, but, alas! there was no
      Miltiades. Mr. Ramsden&rsquo;s health was failing, and his neglect told upon the
      parish in the dreadful evils reigning unchecked, and engulfing many a
      child whom more influential teaching might have saved. Mental arithmetic,
      and the rivers of Africa, had little power to strengthen the soul against
      temptation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scanty attendance at the National School attested the indifference
      with which it was regarded, and the borderers voluntarily patronised
      Cherry Elwood, and thus had, perhaps, first aroused the emulation that led
      Mrs. Ledwich on a visit of inspection, to what she chose to consider as an
      offshoot of the National School.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day she called upon the Misses May. It was well that Ethel was
      not at home. Margaret received the lady&rsquo;s horrors at the sight of the mere
      crowded cottage kitchen, the stupid untrained mistress, without an idea of
      method, and that impertinent woman, her mother! Miss Flora and Miss Ethel
      must have had a great deal to undergo, and she would lose no time in
      convening the Ladies&rsquo; Committee, and appointing a successor to &ldquo;that
      Elwood,&rdquo; as soon as a fit room could be erected for her use. If Margaret
      had not known that Mrs. Ledwich sometimes threatened more than she could
      accomplish, she would have been in despair. She tried to say a good word
      for Cherry, but was talked down, and had reason to believe that Mrs.
      Elwood had mortally offended Mrs. Ledwich.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sisters had heard the other side of the story at Cocksmoor. Mrs.
      Elwood would not let them enter the school till she had heard how that
      there Mrs. Ledwich had come in, and treated them all as if it was her own
      place&mdash;how she had found fault with Cherry before all the children,
      and as good as said she was not fit to keep a school. She had even laid
      hands on one of the books, and said that she should take it home, and see
      whether it were a fit one for them to use; whereupon Mrs. Elwood had burst
      out in defence&mdash;it was Miss Ethel May&rsquo;s book, and should not be taken
      away&mdash;it was Miss Ethel as she looked to; and when it seemed that
      Mrs. Ledwich had said something disparaging of Miss Ethel, either as to
      youth, judgment, or doctrine, Mrs. Elwood had fired up into a declaration
      that &ldquo;Miss Ethel was a real lady&mdash;that she was! and that no real lady
      would ever come prying into other folk&rsquo;s work and finding fault with what
      wasn&rsquo;t no business of theirs,&rdquo; with more of a personal nature, which Flora
      could not help enjoying, even while she regretted it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cherry was only too meek, as her mother declared. She had said not a word,
      except in quiet reply, and being equally terrified by the attack and
      defence, had probably seemed more dull than was her wont. Her real
      feelings did not appear till the next Sunday, when, in her peaceful
      conference with Margaret, far from the sound of storms, she expressed that
      she well knew that she was a poor scholar, and that she hoped the young
      ladies would not let her stand in the children&rsquo;s light, when a better
      teacher could be found for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure!&rdquo; cried Ethel, as she heard of this, &ldquo;it would be hard to find
      such a teacher in humility! Cherry bears it so much better than I, that it
      is a continual reproof!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As to the dullness, against which Ethel used to rail, the attacks upon it
      had made her erect it into a positive merit; she was always comparing the
      truth, honesty, and respectful demeanour of Cherry&rsquo;s scholars with the
      notorious faults of the National School girls, as if these defects had
      been implanted either by Mrs. Ledwich, or by geography. It must be
      confessed that the violence of partisanship did not make her a pleasant
      companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the interest of the bazaar began somewhat to divert the current
      of the ladies&rsquo; thoughts, and Ethel found herself walking day after day to
      Cocksmoor, unmolested by further reports of Mrs. Ledwich&rsquo;s proceedings.
      Richard was absent, preparing for ordination, but Norman had just returned
      home for the Long Vacation, and, rather than lose the chance of a
      conversation with her, had joined her and Mary in a walk to Cocksmoor.
    </p>
    <p>
      His talk was chiefly of Settlesham, old Mr. Wilmot&rsquo;s parish, where he had
      been making a visit to his former tutor, and talking over the removal to
      Eton of Tom, who had well responded to the care taken of him, and with his
      good principles confirmed, and his character strengthened, might be, with
      less danger, exposed to trial.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been a visit such as to leave a deep impression on Norman&rsquo;s mind.
      Sixty years ago, old Mr. Wilmot had been what he now was himself&mdash;an
      enthusiastic and distinguished Balliol man, and he had kept up a warm,
      clear-sighted interest in Oxford throughout his long life. His anecdotes,
      his recollections, and comments on present opinions had been listened to
      with great eagerness, and Norman had felt it an infinite honour to give
      the venerable old man his arm, as to be shown by him his curious
      collection of books. His parish, carefully watched for so many years, had
      been a study not lost upon Norman, who detailed particulars of the doings
      there, which made Ethel sigh to think of the contrast with Stoneborough.
      In such conversation they came to the entrance of the hamlet, and Mary,
      with a scream of joy, declared that she really believed that he was going
      to help them! He did not turn away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo; said Ethel, in a low voice, from the bottom of her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      She used him mercifully, and made the lessons shorter than usual, but when
      they reached the open air again, he drew a long breath; and when Mary
      eagerly tried for a compliment to their scholars, asked if they could not
      be taught the use of eyelids.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did they stare?&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s one advantage of being blind. No one
      can stare me out of countenance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why were you answering all your questions yourself?&rdquo; asked Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because no one else would,&rdquo; said Norman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You used such hard words,&rdquo; replied Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! I thought I was very simple.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Mary, &ldquo;there were derive, and instruction, and implicate, and&mdash;oh,
      so many.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said Ethel, seeing him disconcerted. &ldquo;It is better for them
      to be drawn up, and you will soon learn their language. If we only had Una
      M&rsquo;Carthy here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t like it?&rdquo; said Mary, disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is time to learn not to be fastidious,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;So, if you will
      help me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Norman, I am so glad!&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Norman, &ldquo;I see now that these things that puff us up, and seem
      the whole world to us now, all end in nothing but such as this! Think of
      old Mr. Wilmot, once carrying all before him, but deeming all his powers
      well bestowed in fifty years&rsquo; teaching of clowns!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Ethel, very low. &ldquo;One soul is worth&mdash;&rdquo; and she paused
      from the fullness of thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And these things, about which we are so elated, do not render us so fit
      to teach&mdash;as you, Mary, or as Richard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They do,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;The ten talents were doubled. Strength tells in
      power. The more learning, the fitter to teach the simplest thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You remind me of old Mr. Wilmot saying that the first thing he learned at
      his parish was, how little his people knew; the second, how little he
      himself knew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Norman persevered in the homely discipline that he had chosen for
      himself, which brought out his deficiency in practical work in a manner
      which lowered him in his own eyes, to a degree almost satisfactory to
      himself. He was not, indeed, without humility, but his nature was
      self-contemplative and self-conscious enough to perceive his superiority
      of talent, and it had been the struggle of his life to abase this
      perception, so that it was actually a relief not to be obliged to fight
      with his own complacency in his powers. He had learned not to think too
      highly of himself&mdash;he had yet to learn to &ldquo;think soberly.&rdquo; His aid
      was Ethel&rsquo;s chief pleasure through this somewhat trying summer, it might
      be her last peaceful one at Cocksmoor.
    </p>
    <p>
      That bazaar! How wild it had driven the whole town, and even her own home!
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret herself, between good nature and feminine love of pretty things,
      had become ardent in the cause. In her unvaried life, it was a great
      amusement to have so many bright elegant things exhibited to her, and
      Ethel was often mortified to find her excited about some new device, or
      drawn off from &ldquo;rational employments,&rdquo; to complete some trifle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary and Blanche were far worse. From the time that consent had been given
      to the fancy-work being carried on in the schoolroom, all interest in
      study was over. Thenceforth, lessons were a necessary form, gone through
      without heart or diligence. These were reserved for paste-board boxes,
      beplastered with rice and sealing-wax, for alum baskets, dressed dolls,
      and every conceivable trumpery; and the governess was as eager as the
      scholars.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Ethel remonstrated, she hurt Miss Bracy&rsquo;s feelings, and this was a very
      serious matter to both parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      The governess was one of those morbidly sensitive people, who cannot be
      stopped when once they have begun arguing that they are injured. Two women
      together, each with the last-word instinct, have no power to cease; and,
      when the words are spent in explaining&mdash;not in scolding&mdash;conscience
      is not called in to silence them, and nothing but dinner or a
      thunder-storm can check them. All Ethel&rsquo;s good sense was of no avail; she
      could not stop Miss Bracy, and, though she might resolve within herself
      that real kindness would be to make one reasonable reply, and then quit
      the subject, yet, on each individual occasion, such a measure would have
      seemed mere impatience and cruelty. She found that if Miss Winter had been
      too dry, Miss Bracy went to the other extreme, and demanded a
      manifestation of sympathy, and return to her passionate attachment that
      perplexed Ethel&rsquo;s undemonstrative nature. Poor good Miss Bracy, she little
      imagined how often she added to the worries of her dear Miss Ethel, all
      for want of self-command.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, as the lessons were less and less attended to, and the needs of
      the stall became more urgent, Dr. May and Margaret concurred in a
      decision, that it was better to yield to the mania, and give up the
      studies till they could be pursued with a willing mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel submitted, and only laughed with Norman at the display of treasures,
      which the girls went over daily, like the &ldquo;House that Jack built,&rdquo; always
      starting from &ldquo;the box that Mary made.&rdquo; Come when Dr. May would into the
      drawing-room, there was always a line of penwipers laid out on the floor,
      bags pendent to all the table-drawers, antimacassars laid out everywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel hoped that the holidays would create a diversion, but Mary was too
      old to be made into a boy, and Blanche drew Hector over to the feminine
      party, setting him to gum, gild, and paste all the contrivances which, in
      their hands, were mere feeble gimcracks, but which now became fairly
      sound, or, at least, saleable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys also constructed a beautiful little ship from a print of the
      Alcestis, so successfully, that the doctor promised to buy it; and Ethel
      grudged the very sight of it to the bazaar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom, who, in person, was growing like a little shadow or model of Norman,
      had, unlike him, a very dexterous pair of hands, and made himself
      extremely useful in all such works. On the other hand, the Cleveland stall
      seemed chiefly to rely for brilliance on the wit of Harvey Anderson, who
      was prospering at his college, and the pride of his family. A great
      talker, and extremely gallant, he was considered a far greater acquisition
      to a Stoneborough drawing-room than was the silent, bashful Norman May,
      and rather looked down on his brother Edward, who, having gone steadily
      through the school, was in the attorney&rsquo;s office, and went on quietly and
      well, colouring up gratefully whenever one of the May family said a kind
      word to him.

      CHAPTER III.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       Any silk, any thread,
       Any toys for your head,
     Of the newest and finest wear-a?
       Come to the pedlar,
       Money&rsquo;s a medlar.
     That doth utter all men&rsquo;s ware-a.
                                Winter&rsquo;s Tale.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This one day and it will be over, and we shall be rational again,&rdquo;
       thought Ethel, as she awoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora was sleeping at the Grange, to be ready for action in the morning,
      and Ethel was to go early with Mary and Blanche, who were frantic to have
      a share in the selling. Norman and the boys were to walk at their own
      time, and the children to be brought later by Miss Bracy. The doctor would
      be bound by no rules.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a pattern day, bright, clear, warm, and not oppressive, perfect for
      an out-of-doors fete; and Ethel had made up her mind to fulfil her promise
      to Margaret of enjoying herself. In the brilliant sunshine, and between
      two such happy sisters, it would have been surly, indeed, not to enter
      into the spirit of the day; and Ethel laughed gaily with them, and at
      their schemes and hopes; Blanche&rsquo;s heart being especially set on knowing
      the fate of a watch-guard of her own construction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hearing that the ladies were in the gardens, they repaired thither at
      once. The broad, smooth bowling-green lay before them; a marquee, almost
      converted into a bower, bounding it on either side, while in the midst
      arose, gorgeous and delicious, a pyramid of flowers&mdash;contributions
      from all the hot-houses in the neighbourhood&mdash;to be sold for the
      benefit of the bazaar. Their freshness and fragrance gave a brightness to
      the whole scene, while shrinking from such light, as only the beauteous
      works of nature could bear, was the array accomplished by female fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the wreathed canopies were the stalls, piled up with bright colours,
      most artistically arranged. Ethel, with her over-minute knowledge of every
      article, could hardly believe that yonder glowing Eastern pattern of
      scarlet, black, and blue, was, in fact, a judicious mosaic of penwipers
      that she remembered, as shreds begged from the tailor, that the delicate
      lace-work consisted of Miss Bracy&rsquo;s perpetual antimacassars, and that the
      potichomanie could look so dignified and Etruscan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here you are!&rdquo; cried Meta Rivers, springing to meet them. &ldquo;Good girls, to
      come early. Where&rsquo;s my little Daisy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coming in good time,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;How pretty it all looks!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where&rsquo;s Flora?&mdash;where&rsquo;s my watch-guard?&rdquo; anxiously asked
      Blanche.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was here just now,&rdquo; said Meta, looking round. &ldquo;What a genius she is,
      Ethel! She worked wonders all yesterday, and let the Miss Hoxtons think it
      was all their own doing, and she was out before six this morning, putting
      finishing touches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this your stall?&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but it will not bear a comparison with hers. It has a lady&rsquo;s-maid
      look by the side of hers. In fact, Bellairs and my aunt&rsquo;s maid did it
      chiefly, for papa was rather ailing yesterday, and I could not be out
      much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is he now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better; he will walk round by-and-by. I hope it will not be too much for
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, what beautiful things!&rdquo; cried Mary, in ecstasy, at what she was
      forced to express by the vague substantive, for her imagination had never
      stretched to the marvels she beheld.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, we have been lazy, you see, and so Aunt Leonora brought down all
      these smart concerns. It is rather like Howell and James&rsquo;s, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In fact, Lady Leonora&rsquo;s marquee was filled with costly knick-knacks,
      which, as Meta justly said, had not half the grace and appropriate air
      that reigned where Flora had arranged, and where Margaret had worked, with
      the peculiar freshness and finish that distinguished everything to which
      she set her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Cleveland&rsquo;s counter was not ill set-out, but it wanted the air of
      ease and simplicity, which was even more noticeable than the perfect taste
      of Flora&rsquo;s wares. If there had been nothing facetious, the effect would
      have been better, but there was nothing to regret, and the whole was very
      bright and gay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blanche could hardly look; so anxious was she for Flora to tell her the
      locality of her treasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There she is,&rdquo; said Meta at last. &ldquo;George is fixing that branch of
      evergreen for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flora! I did not know her,&rdquo; cried each sister amazed; while Mary added,
      &ldquo;Oh, how nice she looks!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the first time of seeing her in the white muslin, and broad chip
      hat&mdash;which all the younger saleswomen of the bazaar had agreed to
      wear. It was a most becoming dress, and she did, indeed, look strikingly
      elegant and well dressed. It occurred to Ethel, for the first time, that
      Flora was decidedly the reigning beauty of the bazaar&mdash;no one but
      Meta Rivers could be compared to her, and that little lady was on so small
      a scale of perfect finish, that she seemed fit to act the fairy, where
      Flora was the enchanted princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora greeted her sisters eagerly, while Meta introduced her brother&mdash;a
      great contrast to herself, though not without a certain comeliness, tall
      and large, with ruddy complexion, deep lustreless black eyes, and a heavy
      straight bush of black moustache, veiling rather thick lips. Blanche
      reiterated inquiries for her watch-guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo;&mdash;said Flora. &ldquo;Somewhere among the rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Blanche was in despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may look for it,&rdquo; said Flora, who, however hurried, never failed in
      kindness, &ldquo;if you will touch nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Blanche ran from place to place in restless dismay, that caused Mr.
      George Rivers to ask what was the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The guards! the guards!&rdquo; cried Blanche; whereupon he fell into a fit of
      laughter, which disconcerted her, because she could not understand him,
      and made Ethel take an aversion to him on the spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, he was very good-natured; he took Blanche&rsquo;s reluctant hand, and
      conducted her all along the stall, even proceeding to lift her up where
      she could not command a view of the whole, thus exciting her extreme
      indignation. She shook herself out when he set her down, surveyed her
      crumpled muslin, and believed he took her for a little girl! She ought to
      have been flattered when the quest was successful, and he insisted on
      knowing which was the guard, and declared that he should buy it. She
      begged him to do no such thing, and he desired to know why&mdash;insisting
      that he would give five shillings&mdash;fifteen&mdash;twenty-five for that
      one! till she did not know whether he was in earnest, and she doing an
      injury to the bazaar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, the hour had struck, and Flora had placed Mrs. Hoxton in a
      sheltered spot, where she could take as much or as little trouble as she
      pleased. Lady Leonora and Miss Langdale came from the house, and, with the
      two ladies&rsquo;-maids in the background, took up their station with Miss
      Rivers. Miss Cleveland called her party to order, and sounds of carriages
      were heard approaching.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary and Blanche disbursed the first money spent in the &ldquo;fancy fair;&rdquo;
       Mary, on a blotting-book for Harry, to be placed among the presents, to
      which she added on every birthday, while Blanche bought a sixpenny gift
      for every one, with more attention to the quantity than the quality. Then
      came a revival of her anxieties for the guards, and while Mary was simply
      desirous of the fun of being a shopwoman, and was made happy by Meta
      Rivers asking her help, Blanche was in despair, till she had sidled up to
      their neighbourhood, and her piteous looks had caused good-natured Mrs.
      Hoxton to invite her to assist, when she placed herself close to the
      precious object.
    </p>
    <p>
      A great fluttering of heart went to that manoeuvre, but still felicity
      could not be complete. That great troublesome Mr. George Rivers had
      actually threatened to buy nothing but that one watch-chain, and Blanche&rsquo;s
      eye followed him everywhere with fear, lest he should come that way. And
      there were many other gentlemen&mdash;what could they want but
      watch-guards, and of them&mdash;what&mdash;save this paragon?
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Blanche; what did she not undergo whenever any one cast his eye over
      her range of goods? and this was not seldom, for there was an attraction
      in the pretty little eager girl, glowing and smiling. One old gentleman
      actually stopped, handled the guards themselves, and asked their price.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eighteen-pence,&rdquo; said Blanche, colouring and faltering, as she held up
      one in preference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! is not this the best?&rdquo; said he, to the lady on his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! please, take that instead?&rdquo; exclaimed Blanche, in extremity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why?&rdquo; asked the gentleman, amused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I made this,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that the reason I must not have it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t tease her,&rdquo; the lady said kindly; and the other was taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder for what it is reserved!&rdquo; the lady could not help saying, as she
      walked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us watch her for a minute or two. What an embellishment children are!
      Ha! don&rsquo;t you see&mdash;the little maid is fluttering and reddening&mdash;now!
      How pretty she looks! Ah! I see! here&rsquo;s the favoured! Don&rsquo;t you see that
      fine bronzed lad&mdash;Eton&mdash;one can see at a glance! It is a little
      drama. They are pretending to be strangers. He is turning over the goods
      with an air, she trying to look equally careless, but what a pretty
      carnation it is! Ha! ha! he has come to it&mdash;he has it! Now the acting
      is over, and they are having their laugh out! How joyously! What next! Oh!
      she begs off from keeping shop&mdash;she darts out to him, goes off in his
      hand&mdash;I declare that is the prettiest sight in the whole fair! I
      wonder who the little demoiselle can be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The great event of the day was over now with Blanche, and she greatly
      enjoyed wandering about with Hector and Tom. There was a post-office at
      Miss Cleveland&rsquo;s stall, where, on paying sixpence, a letter could be
      obtained to the address of the inquirer. Blanche had been very anxious to
      try, but Flora had pronounced it nonsense; however, Hector declared that
      Flora was not his master, tapped at the sliding panel, and charmed Blanche
      by what she thought a most witty parody of his name as Achilles Lionsrock,
      Esquire. When the answer came from within, &ldquo;Ship letter, sir, double
      postage,&rdquo; they thought it almost uncanny; and Hector&rsquo;s shilling was
      requited by something so like a real ship letter, that they had some idea
      that the real post had somehow transported itself thither. The interior
      was decidedly oracular, consisting of this one line, &ldquo;I counsel you to
      persevere in your laudable undertaking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hector said he wished he had any laudable undertaking, and Blanche tried
      to persuade Tom to try his fortune, but he pronounced that he did not care
      to hear Harvey Anderson&rsquo;s trash&mdash;he knew his writing, though
      disguised, and had detected his shining boots below the counter. There Mr.
      George Rivers came up, and began to tease Blanche about the guards, asking
      her to take his fifteen shillings&mdash;or five-and-twenty, and who had
      got that one, which alone he wanted; till the poor child, after standing
      perplexed for some moments, looked up with spirit, and said, &ldquo;You have no
      business to ask,&rdquo; and, running away, took refuge in the back of Mrs.
      Hoxton&rsquo;s marquee, where she found Ethel packing up for Miss Hoxton&rsquo;s
      purchasers, and confiding to her that Mr. George Rivers was a horrid man,
      she ventured no more from her protection. She did, indeed, emerge, when
      told that papa was coming with Aubrey and Daisy and Miss Bracy, and she
      had the pleasure of selling to them some of her wares. Dr. May bargaining
      with her to her infinite satisfaction; and little Gertrude&rsquo;s blue eyes
      opened to their full width, not understanding what could have befallen her
      sisters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is Ethel doing?&rdquo; asked the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Packing up parcels, papa,&rdquo; and Ethel&rsquo;s face was raised, looking very
      merry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Packing parcels! How long will they last tied up?&rdquo; said Dr. May,
      laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lasting is the concern of nothing in the fair, papa,&rdquo; answered she, in
      the same tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Ethel was noted as the worst packer in the house; but, having offered
      to wrap up a pincushion, sold by a hurried Miss Hoxton, she became
      involved in the office for the rest of the day&mdash;the same which
      Bellairs and her companion performed at the Langdale counter. Flora was
      too ready and dexterous to need any such aid, but the Misses Hoxton were
      glad to be spared the trouble; and Blanche, whose fingers were far neater
      than Ethel&rsquo;s, made the task much easier, and was kept constant to it by
      her dread of the dark moustache, which was often visible near their tent,
      searching, she thought, for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their humble employment was no sinecure; for this was the favourite stall
      with the purchasers of better style, since the articles were, in general,
      tasteful, and fairly worth the moderate price set on them. At Miss
      Cleveland&rsquo;s counter there was much noisy laughter&mdash;many jocular
      cheats&mdash;tricks for gaining money, and refusals to give change; and it
      seemed to be very popular with the Stoneborough people, and to carry on a
      brisk trade. The only languor was in Lady Leonora&rsquo;s quarter&mdash;the
      articles were too costly, and hung on hand; nor were the ladies
      sufficiently well known, nor active enough, to gain custom, excepting
      Meta, who drove a gay traffic at her end of the stall, which somewhat
      redeemed the general languor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes were, all the time, watching for her father, and, suddenly
      perceiving him, she left her trade in charge of the delighted and
      important Mary, and hastened to walk round with him, and show him the
      humours of the fair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary, in her absence, had the supreme happiness of obtaining Norman as a
      customer. He wanted a picture for his rooms at Oxford, and water-coloured
      drawings were, as Tom had observed, suitable staple commodities for Miss
      Rivers. Mary tried to make him choose a brightly-coloured pheasant, with a
      pencil background; and, then, a fine foaming sea-piece, by some unknown
      Lady Adelaide, that much dazzled her imagination; but nothing would serve
      him but a sketch of an old cedar tree, with Stoneborough Minster in the
      distance, and the Welsh hills beyond, which Mary thought a remarkable
      piece of bad taste, since&mdash;could he not see all that any day of his
      life? and was it worth while to give fourteen shillings and sixpence for
      it? But he said it was all for the good of Cocksmoor, and Mary was only
      too glad to add to her hoard of coin; so she only marvelled at his
      extravagance, and offered to take care of it for him; but, to this, he
      would not consent. He made her pack it up for him, and had just put the
      whitey-brown parcel under his arm, when Mr. Rivers and his daughter came
      up, before he was aware. Mary proudly advertised Meta that she had sold
      something for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! What was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your great picture of Stoneborough!&rdquo; said Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that gone? I am sorry you have parted with that, my dear; it was one
      of your best,&rdquo; said Mr. Rivers, in his soft, sleepy, gentle tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, papa, I can do another. But, I wonder! I put that extortionate price
      on it, thinking no one would give it, and so that I should keep it for
      you. Who has it, Mary?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Norman, there. He would have it, though I told him it was very dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norman, pressed near them by the crowd, had been unable to escape, and
      stood blushing, hesitating, and doubting whether he ought to restore the
      prize, which he had watched so long, and obtained so eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! it is you?&rdquo; said Mr. Rivers politely. &ldquo;Oh, no, do not think of
      exchanging it. I am rejoiced that one should have it who can appreciate
      it. It was its falling into the hands of a stranger that I disliked. You
      think with me, that it is one of her best drawings?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do,&rdquo; said Norman, still rather hesitating. &ldquo;She did that with C&mdash;,
      when he was here last year. He taught her very well. Have you that other
      here, that you took with him, my dear? The view from the gate, I mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, dear papa. You told me not to sell that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I remember; that is right. But there are some very pretty copies from
      Prout here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While he was seeking them, Meta contrived to whisper, &ldquo;If you could
      persuade him to go indoors&mdash;this confusion of people is so bad for
      him, and I must not come away. I was in hopes of Dr. May, but he is with
      the little ones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norman signed comprehension, and Meta said, &ldquo;Those copies are not worth
      seeing, but you know, papa, you have the originals in the library.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Rivers looked pleased, but was certain that Norman could not prefer
      the sketches to this gay scene. However, it took very little persuasion to
      induce him to do what he wished, and he took Norman&rsquo;s arm, crossed the
      lawn, and arrived in his own study, where it was a great treat to him to
      catch any one who would admire his accumulation of prints, drawings,
      coins, etc.; and his young friend was both very well amused and pleased to
      be setting Miss Rivers&rsquo;s mind at ease on her father&rsquo;s account. It was not
      till half-past four that Dr. May knocked at the door, and stood surprised
      at finding his son there. Mr. Rivers spoke warmly of the young Oxonian&rsquo;s
      kindness in leaving the fair for an old man, and praised Norman&rsquo;s taste in
      art. Norman rose to take leave, but still thought it incumbent on him to
      offer to give up the picture, if Mr. Rivers set an especial value on it.
      But Mr. Rivers went to the length of being very glad that it was in his
      possession, and added to it a very pretty drawing of the same size, by a
      noted master, which had been in the water-colour exhibition, and, while
      Norman walked away, well pleased, Mr. Rivers began to extol him to his
      father, as a very superior and sensible young man, of great promise, and
      began to wish George had the same turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norman, on returning to the fancy fair, found the world in all the ardour
      of raffles. Lady Leonora&rsquo;s contributions were the chief prizes, which
      attracted every one, and, of course, the result was delightfully
      incongruous. Poor Ethel, who had been persuaded to venture a shilling to
      please Blanche, who had spent all her own, obtained the two jars in
      potichomanie, and was regarding them with a face worth painting. Harvey
      Anderson had a doll, George Rivers a wooden monkey, that jumped over a
      stick; and, if Hector Ernescliffe was enchanted at winning a beautiful
      mother-of-pearl inlaid workbox, which he had vainly wished to buy for
      Margaret, Flora only gained a match-box of her own, well known always to
      miss fire, but which had been decided to be good enough for the bazaar.
    </p>
    <p>
      By fair means or foul, the commodities were cleared off, and, while the
      sunbeams faded from the trodden grass, the crowds disappeared, and the
      vague compliment, &ldquo;a very good bazaar,&rdquo; was exchanged between the
      lingering sellers and their friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora was again to sleep at the Grange, and return the next day, for a
      committee to be held over the gains, which were not yet fully ascertained.
      So Dr. May gathered his flock together, and packed them, boys and all,
      into the two conveyances, and Ethel bade Meta good-night, almost wondering
      to hear her merry voice say, &ldquo;It has been a delightful day, has it not? It
      was so kind of your brother to take care of papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it was delightful!&rdquo; echoed Mary, &ldquo;and I took one pound fifteen and
      sixpence!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope it will do great good to Cocksmoor,&rdquo; added Meta, &ldquo;but, if you want
      real help, you know, you must come to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel smiled, but hurried her departure, for she saw Blanche again
      tormented by Mr. George Rivers, to know what had become of the guard,
      telling her that, if she would not say, he should be furiously jealous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blanche hid her face on Ethel&rsquo;s arm, when they were in the carriage, and
      almost cried with indignant &ldquo;shamefastness.&rdquo; That long-desired day had not
      been one of unmixed happiness to her, poor child, and Ethel doubted
      whether it had been so to any one, except, indeed, to Mary, whose desires
      never soared so high but that they were easily fulfilled, and whose placid
      content was not easily wounded. All she was wishing now was, that Harry
      were at home to receive his paper-case.
    </p>
    <p>
      The return to Margaret was real pleasure. The narration of all that had
      passed was an event to her. She was so charmed with her presents, of every
      degree; things, unpleasant at the time, could, by drollery in the
      relating, be made mirthful fun ever after; Dr. May and the boys were so
      comical in their observations&mdash;Mary&rsquo;s wonder and simplicity came in
      so amazingly&mdash;and there was such merriment at Ethel&rsquo;s two precious
      jars, that she could hardly wish they had not come to her. On one head
      they were all agreed, in dislike of George Rivers, whom Mary pronounced to
      be a detestable man, and, when gently called to order by Margaret,
      defended it, by saying that Miss Bracy said it was better to detest than
      to hate, while Blanche coloured up to the ears, and hid herself behind the
      arm-chair; and Dr. May qualified the censure by saying, he believed there
      was no great harm in the youth, but that he was shallow-brained and
      extravagant, and, having been born in the days when Mr. Rivers had been
      working himself up in the world, had not had so good an education as his
      little half-sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what are you thinking of?&rdquo; said her father, laying his hand on
      Ethel&rsquo;s arm, as she was wearily and pensively putting together the
      scattered purchases before going up to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was thinking, papa, that there is a great deal of trouble taken in this
      world for a very little pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The trouble is the pleasure, in most cases, most misanthropical miss!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that is true; but, if so, why cannot it be taken for some good?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They meant it to be good,&rdquo; said Dr. May. &ldquo;Come, I cannot have you severe
      and ungrateful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I have been telling myself, papa, all along; but, now that the day has
      come, and I have seen what jealousies, and competitions, and vanities, and
      disappointments it has produced&mdash;not even poor little Blanche allowed
      any comfort&mdash;I am almost sick at heart with thinking Cocksmoor was
      the excuse!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spectators are more philosophical than actors, Ethel. Others have not
      been tying parcels all day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had rather do that than&mdash;But that is the &lsquo;Fox and the Grapes,&rsquo;&rdquo;
       said Ethel, smiling. &ldquo;What I mean is, that the real gladness of life is
      not in these great occasions of pleasure, but in the little side delights
      that come in the midst of one&rsquo;s work, don&rsquo;t they, papa? Why is it worth
      while to go and search for a day&rsquo;s pleasuring?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ethel, my child! I don&rsquo;t like to hear you talk so,&rdquo; said Dr. May, looking
      anxiously at her. &ldquo;It may be too true, but it is not youthful nor hopeful.
      It is not as your mother or I felt in our young days, when a treat was a
      treat to us, and gladdened our hearts long before and after. I am afraid
      you have been too much saddened with loss and care&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, papa!&rdquo; said Ethel, rousing herself, though speaking huskily. &ldquo;You
      know I am your merry Ethel. You know I can be happy enough&mdash;only at
      home&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Ethel, though she had tried to be cheerful, leaned against his arm,
      and shed a few tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is, she is tired out,&rdquo; said Dr. May soothingly, yet half
      laughing. &ldquo;She is not a beauty or a grace, and she is thoughtful and
      quiet, and so she moralises, instead of enjoying, as the world goes by. I
      dare say a night&rsquo;s rest will make all the difference in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! but there is more to come. That Ladies&rsquo; Committee at Cocksmoor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are not there yet, Ethel. Good-night, you tired little cynic.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER IV.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Back then, complainer...
     Go, to the world return, nor fear to cast
     Thy bread upon the waters, sure at last
        In joy to find it after many days.&mdash;Christian Year.
</pre>
    <p>
      The next day Ethel had hoped for a return to reason, but behold, the world
      was cross! The reaction of the long excitement was felt, Gertrude fretted,
      and was unwell; Aubrey was pettish at his lessons; and Mary and Blanche
      were weary, yawning and inattentive; every straw was a burden, and Miss
      Bracy had feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel had been holding an interminable conversation with her in the
      schoolroom, interrupted at last by a summons to speak to a Cocksmoor woman
      at the back door, and she was returning from the kitchen, when the doctor
      called her into his study.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ethel! what is all this? Mary has found Miss Bracy in floods of tears in
      the schoolroom, because she says you told her she was ill-tempered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure you will be quite as much surprised,&rdquo; said Ethel, somewhat
      exasperated, &ldquo;when you hear that you lacerated her feelings yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? Why, what did I do?&rdquo; exclaimed Dr. May.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You showed your evident want of confidence in her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? What can I have done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You met Aubrey and Gertrude in her charge, and you took them away at once
      to walk with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that was it. She saw you had no confidence in her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ethel, what on earth can you mean? I saw the two children dragging on
      her, and I thought she would see nothing that was going on, and would be
      glad to be released; and I wanted them to go with me and see Meta&rsquo;s gold
      pheasants.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was the offence. She has been breaking her heart all this time,
      because she was sure, from your manner, that you were displeased to see
      them alone with her&mdash;eating bon-bons, I believe, and therefore took
      them away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daisy is the worse for her bon-bons, I believe, but the overdose of them
      rests on my shoulders. I do not know how to believe you, Ethel. Of course
      you told her nothing of the kind crossed my mind, poor thing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told her so, over and over again, as I have done forty times before but
      her feelings are always being hurt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor thing, poor thing! no doubt it is a trying situation, and she is
      sensitive. Surely you are all forbearing with her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope we are,&rdquo; said Ethel; &ldquo;but how can we tell what vexes her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is this, of your telling her she was ill-tempered?&rdquo; asked Dr.
      May incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, papa,&rdquo; said Ethel, softened, yet wounded by his thinking it so
      impossible. &ldquo;I had often thought I ought to tell her that these sensitive
      feelings of hers were nothing but temper; and perhaps&mdash;indeed I know
      I do&mdash;I partake of the general fractiousness of the house to-day, and
      I did not bear it so patiently as usual. I did say that I thought it wrong
      to foster her fancies; for if she looked at them coolly, she would find
      they were only a form of pride and temper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It did not come well from you, Ethel,&rdquo; said the doctor, looking vexed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I know it did not,&rdquo; said Ethel meekly; &ldquo;but oh! to have these
      janglings once a week, and to see no end to them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once a week?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is really as often, or more often,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;If any of us
      criticise anything the girls have done, if there is a change in any
      arrangement, if she thinks herself neglected&mdash;I can&rsquo;t tell you what
      little matters suffice; she will catch me, and argue with me, till&mdash;oh,
      till we are both half dead, and yet cannot stop ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you argue?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I could only help it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bad management,&rdquo; said the doctor, in a low, musing tone. &ldquo;You want a
      head!&rdquo; and he sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, papa, I did not mean to distress you. I would not have told you if I
      had remembered&mdash;but I am worried to-day, and off my guard&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ethel, I thought you were the one on whom I could depend for bearing
      everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These were such nonsense!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What may seem nonsense to you is not the same to her. You must be
      forbearing, Ethel. Remember that dependence is prone to morbid
      sensitiveness, especially in those who have a humble estimate of
      themselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me that touchiness is more pride than humility,&rdquo; said Ethel,
      whose temper, already not in the smoothest state, found it hard that,
      after having long borne patiently with these constant arguments, she
      should find Miss Bracy made the chief object of compassion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. May&rsquo;s chivalrous feeling caused him to take the part of the weak, and
      he answered, &ldquo;You know nothing about it. Among our own kith and kin we can
      afford to pass over slights, because we are sure the heart is right&mdash;we
      do not know what it is to be among strangers, uncertain of any claim to
      their esteem or kindness. Sad! sad!&rdquo; he continued, as the picture wrought
      on him. &ldquo;Each trifle seems a token one way or the other! I am very sorry I
      grieved the poor thing yesterday. I must go and tell her so at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put Ethel aside, and knocked at the schoolroom door, while Ethel stood,
      mortified. &ldquo;He thinks I have been neglecting, or speaking harshly to her!
      For fifty times that I have borne with her maundering, I have, at last,
      once told her the truth; and for that I am accused of want of forbearance!
      Now he will go and make much of her, and pity her, till she will think
      herself an injured heroine, and be worse than ever; and he will do away
      with all the good of my advice, and want me to ask her pardon for it&mdash;but
      that I never will. It was only the truth, and I will stick to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ethel!&rdquo; cried Mary, running up to her, then slackening her pace, and
      whispering, &ldquo;you did not tell Miss Bracy she was ill-tempered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;not exactly. How could you tell papa I did?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She said so. She was crying, and I asked what was the matter, and she
      said my sister Ethel said she was ill-tempered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She made a great exaggeration then,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure she was very cross all day,&rdquo; said Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that is no business of yours,&rdquo; said Ethel pettishly. &ldquo;What now?
      Mary, don&rsquo;t look out at the street window.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is Flora&mdash;the Grange carriage,&rdquo; whispered Mary, as the two
      sisters made a precipitate retreat into the drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Dr. May had been in the schoolroom. Miss Bracy had ceased her
      tears before he came&mdash;they had been her retort on Ethel, and she had
      not intended the world to know of them. Half disconcerted, half angry, she
      heard the doctor approach. She was a gentle, tearful woman, one of those
      who are often called meek, under an erroneous idea that meekness consists
      in making herself exceedingly miserable under every kind of grievance; and
      she now had a sort of melancholy satisfaction in believing that the young
      ladies had fabricated an exaggerated complaint of her temper, and that she
      was going to become injured innocence. To think herself accused of a great
      wrong, excused her from perceiving herself guilty of a lesser one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Bracy,&rdquo; said Dr. May, entering with his frank, sweet look, &ldquo;I am
      concerned that I vexed you by taking the children to walk with me
      yesterday. I thought such little brats would be troublesome to any but
      their spoiling papa, but they would have been in safer hands with you. You
      would not have been as weak as I was, in regard to sugar-plums.&rdquo; Such
      amends as these confused Miss Bracy, who found it pleasanter to be
      lamentable with Ethel, than to receive a full apology for her imagined
      offence from the master of the house. Feeling both small and absurd, she
      murmured something of &ldquo;oh, no,&rdquo; and &ldquo;being sure,&rdquo; and hoped he was going,
      so that she might sit down to pity herself, for those girls having made
      her appear so ridiculous.
    </p>
    <p>
      No such thing! Dr. May put a chair for her, and sat down himself, saying,
      with a smile, &ldquo;You see, you must trust us sometimes, and overlook it, if
      we are less considerate than we might be. We have rough, careless habits
      with each other, and forget that all are not used to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Bracy exclaimed, &ldquo;Oh, no, never, they were most kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We wish to be,&rdquo; said Dr. May, &ldquo;but there are little neglects&mdash;or you
      think there are. I will not say there are none, for that would be
      answering too much for human nature, or that they are fanciful&mdash;for
      that would be as little comfort as to tell a patient that the pain is only
      nervous&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Bracy smiled, for she could remember instances when, after suffering
      much at the time, she had found the affront imaginary.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was glad of that smile, and proceeded. &ldquo;You will let me speak to you,
      as to one of my own girls? To them, I should say, use the only true cure.
      Don&rsquo;t brood over vexations, small or great, but think of them as trials
      that, borne bravely, become blessings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! but Dr. May!&rdquo; she exclaimed, shocked; &ldquo;nothing in your house could
      call for such feelings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope we are not very savage,&rdquo; he said, smiling; &ldquo;but, indeed, I still
      say it is the safest rule. It would be the only one if you were really
      among unkind people; and, if you take so much to heart an unlucky neglect
      of mine, what would you do if the slight were a true one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right; but my feelings were always over-sensitive;&rdquo; and this she
      said with a sort of complacency.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we must try to brace them,&rdquo; said Dr. May, much as if prescribing
      for her. &ldquo;Will not you believe in our confidence and esteem, and harden
      yourself against any outward unintentional piece of incivility?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She felt as if she could at that moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or at least, try to forgive and forget them. Talking them over only
      deepens the sense of them, and discussions do no good to any one. My
      daughters are anxious to be your best friends, as I hope you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! they are most kind&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, you see, I must say this,&rdquo; added Dr. May, somewhat hesitating, &ldquo;as
      they have no mother to&mdash;to spare all this,&rdquo; and then, growing
      clearer, he proceeded, &ldquo;I must beg you to be forbearing with them, and not
      perplex yourself and them with arguing on what cannot be helped. They have
      not the experience that could enable them to finish such a discussion
      without unkindness; and it can only waste the spirits, and raise fresh
      subjects of regret. I must leave you&mdash;I hear myself called.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Bracy began to be sensible that she had somewhat abused Ethel&rsquo;s
      patience; and the unfortunate speech about the source of her sensitiveness
      did not appear to her so direfully cruel as at first. She hoped every one
      would forget all about it, and resolved not to take umbrage so easily
      another time, or else be silent about it, but she was not a person of much
      resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor found that Meta Rivers and her brother had brought Flora home,
      and were in the drawing-room, where Margaret was hearing another edition
      of the history of the fair, and a by-play was going on, of teasing Blanche
      about the chain.
    </p>
    <p>
      George Rivers was trying to persuade her to make one for him; and her
      refusal came out at last, in an almost passionate key, in the midst of the
      other conversation&mdash;&ldquo;No! I say-no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another no, and that will be yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! I won&rsquo;t! I don&rsquo;t like you well enough!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret gravely sent Blanche and the other children away to take their
      walk, and the brother and sister soon after took leave, when Flora called
      Ethel to hasten to the Ladies&rsquo; Committee, that they might arrange the
      disposal of the one hundred and fifty pounds, the amount of their gains.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To see the fate of Cocksmoor,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I cannot manage the Stoneborough folk?&rdquo; said Flora, looking
      radiant with good humour, and conscious of power. &ldquo;Poor Ethel! I am doing
      you good against your will! Never mind, here is wherewith to build the
      school, and the management will be too happy to fall into our hands. Do
      you think every one is as ready as you are, to walk three miles and back
      continually?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was sense in this; there always was sense in what Flora said, but it
      jarred on Ethel; and it seemed almost unsympathising in her to be so gay,
      when the rest were wearied or perturbed. Ethel would have been very glad
      of a short space to recollect herself, and recover her good temper; but it
      was late, and Flora hurried her to put on her bonnet, and come to the
      committee. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take care of your interests,&rdquo; she said, as they set out.
      &ldquo;You look as doleful as if you thought you should be robbed of Cocksmoor;
      but that is the last thing that will happen, you will see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would not be acting fairly to let them build for us, and then for us
      to put them out of the management,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, they want importance, not action. They will leave the real power
      to us of themselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You like to build Cocksmoor with such instruments,&rdquo; said Ethel, whose
      ruffled condition made her forget her resolution not to argue with Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bricks are made of clay!&rdquo; said Flora. &ldquo;There, that was said like Norman
      himself! On your plan, we might have gone on for forty years, saving seven
      shillings a year, and spending six, whenever there was an illness in the
      place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, who used to dislike these people more than even I did!&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was when I was an infant, my dear, and did not know how to deal with
      them. I will take care&mdash;I will even save Cherry Elwood for you, if I
      can. Alan Ernescliffe&rsquo;s ten pounds is a noble weapon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You always mean to manage everything, and then you have no time!&rdquo; said
      Ethel, sensible all the time of her own ill-humour, and of her sister&rsquo;s
      patience and amiability, yet propelled to speak the unpleasant truths that
      in her better moods were held back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still Flora was good-tempered, though Ethel would almost have preferred
      her being provoked; &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I have been using you ill, and
      leaving the world on your shoulders, but it was all in your service and
      Cocksmoor&rsquo;s; and now we shall begin to be reasonable and useful again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, Ethel, to comfort you, I think I shall send you with Norman to
      dine at Abbotstoke Grange on Wednesday. Mr. Rivers begged us to come; he
      is so anxious to make it lively for his son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, I do not think Mr. George Rivers and I should be likely to get
      on together. What a bad style of wit! You heard what Mary said about him?
      and Ethel repeated the doubt between hating and detesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young men never know how to talk to little girls,&rdquo; was Flora&rsquo;s reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment they came up with one of the Miss Andersons, and Flora
      began to exchange civilities, and talk over yesterday&rsquo;s events with great
      animation. Her notice always gave pleasure, brightened as it was by the
      peculiarly engaging address which she had inherited from her father, and
      which, therefore, was perfectly easy and natural. Fanny Anderson was
      flattered and gratified, rather by the manner than the words, and, on
      excellent terms, they entered the committee-room, namely, the
      schoolmistress&rsquo;s parlour.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were nine ladies on the committee&mdash;nine muses, as the doctor
      called them, because they produced anything but harmony. Mrs. Ledwich was
      in the chair; Miss Rich was secretary, and had her pen and ink, and
      account-book ready. Flora came in, smiling and greeting; Ethel, grave,
      earnest, and annoyed, behind her, trying to be perfectly civil, but not at
      all enjoying the congratulations on the successful bazaar. The ladies all
      talked and discussed their yesterday&rsquo;s adventures, gathering in little
      knots, as they traced the fate of favourite achievements of their skill,
      while Ethel, lugubrious and impatient, beside Flora, the only one not
      engaged, and, therefore, conscious of the hubbub of clacking tongues.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Mrs. Ledwich glanced at the mistress&rsquo;s watch, in its pasteboard
      tower, in Gothic architecture, and insisted on proceeding to business. So
      they all sat down round a circular table, with a very fine red, blue, and
      black oilcloth, whose pattern was inseparably connected, in Ethel&rsquo;s mind,
      with absurdity, tedium, and annoyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The business was opened by the announcement of what they all knew before,
      that the proceeds of the fancy fair amounted to one hundred and forty-nine
      pounds fifteen shillings and tenpence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came a pause, and Mrs. Ledwich said that next they had to consider
      what was the best means of disposing of the sum gained in this most
      gratifying manner. Every one except Flora, Ethel, and quiet Mrs. Ward,
      began to talk at once. There was a great deal about Elizabethan
      architecture, crossed by much more, in which normal, industrial, and
      common things, most often met Ethel&rsquo;s ear, with some stories, second-hand,
      from Harvey Anderson, of marvellous mistakes; and, on the opposite side of
      the table, there was Mrs. Ledwich, impressively saying something to the
      silent Mrs. Ward, marking her periods with emphatic beats with her pencil,
      and each seemed to close with &ldquo;Mrs. Perkinson&rsquo;s niece,&rdquo; whom Ethel knew to
      be Cherry&rsquo;s intended supplanter. She looked piteously at Flora, who only
      smiled and made a sign with her hand to her to be patient. Ethel fretted
      inwardly at that serene sense of power; but she could not but admire how
      well Flora knew how to bide her time, when, having waited till Mrs.
      Ledwich had nearly wound up her discourse on Mrs. Elwood&rsquo;s impudence, and
      Mrs. Perkinson&rsquo;s niece, she leaned towards Miss Boulder, who sat between,
      and whispered to her, &ldquo;Ask Mrs. Ledwich if we should not begin with some
      steps for getting the land.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Boulder, having acted as conductor, the president exclaimed, &ldquo;Just
      so, the land is the first consideration. We must at once take steps for
      obtaining it.&rdquo; Thereupon Mrs. Ledwich, who &ldquo;always did things
      methodically,&rdquo; moved, and Miss Anderson seconded, that the land requisite
      for the school must be obtained, and the nine ladies held up their hands,
      and resolved it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Rich duly recorded the great resolution, and Miss Boulder suggested
      that, perhaps, they might write to the National Society, or Government, or
      something; whereat Miss Rich began to flourish one of the very long goose
      quills which stood in the inkstand before her, chiefly as insignia of
      office, for she always wrote with a small, stiff metal pen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora here threw in a query, whether the National Society, or Government,
      or something, would give them a grant, unless they had the land to build
      upon?
    </p>
    <p>
      The ladies all started off hereupon, and all sorts of instances of
      hardness of heart were mentioned, the most relevant of which was, that the
      Church Building Society would not give a grant to Mr. Holloway&rsquo;s
      proprietary chapel at Whitford, when Mrs. Ledwich was suddenly struck with
      the notion that dear Mr. Holloway might be prevailed on to come to
      Stoneborough to preach a sermon in the Minster, for the benefit of
      Cocksmoor, when they would all hold plates at the door. Flora gave Ethel a
      tranquillising pat, and, as Mrs. Ledwich turned to her, asking whether she
      thought Dr. May, or Dr. Hoxton, would prevail on him to come, she said,
      with her winning look, &ldquo;I think that consideration had better wait till we
      have some more definite view. Had we not better turn to this land
      question?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite true!&rdquo; they all agreed, but to whom did the land belong?&mdash;and
      what a chorus arose! Miss Anderson thought it belonged to Mr. Nicolson,
      because the wagons of slate had James Nicolson on them, and, if so, they
      had no chance, for he was an old miser&mdash;and six stories illustrative
      thereof ensued. Miss Rich was quite sure some Body held it, and Bodies
      were slow of movement. Mrs. Ledwich remembered some question of enclosing,
      and thought all waste lands were under the Crown; she knew that the
      Stoneborough people once had a right to pasture their cattle, because Mr.
      Southron&rsquo;s cow had tumbled down a loam-pit when her mother was a girl. No,
      that was on Far-view down, out the other way! Miss Harrison was positive
      that Sir Henry Walkinghame had some right there, and would not Dr. May
      apply to him? Mrs. Grey thought it ought to be part of the Drydale estate,
      and Miss Boulder was certain that Mr. Bramshaw knew all about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora&rsquo;s gentle voice carried conviction that she knew what she was saying,
      when, at last, they left a moment for her to speak&mdash;(Ethel would have
      done so long ago). &ldquo;If I am not mistaken, the land is a copyhold of Sir
      Henry Walkinghame, held under the manor of Drydale, which belongs to M&mdash;&mdash;
      College, and is underlet to Mr. Nicolson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Everybody, being partially right, was delighted, and had known it all
      before; Miss Boulder agreed with Miss Anderson that Miss May had stated it
      as lucidly as Mr. Bramshaw could. The next question was, to whom to apply?
      and, after as much as was expedient had been said in favour of each, it
      was decided that, as Sir Henry Walkinghame was abroad, no one knew exactly
      where, it would be best to go to the fountain-head, and write at once to
      the principal of the college. But who was to write? Flora proposed Mr.
      Ramsden as the fittest person, but this was negatived. Every one declared
      that he would never take the trouble, and Miss Rich began to agitate her
      pens. By this time, however, Mrs. Ward, who was opposite to the Gothic
      clock-tower, began to look uneasy, and suggested, in a nervous manner,
      that it was half-past five, and she was afraid Mr. Ward would be kept
      waiting for his dinner. Mrs. Grey began to have like fears, that Mr. Grey
      would be come in from his ride after banking hours. The other ladies began
      to think of tea, and the meeting decided on adjourning till that day next
      week, when the committee would sit upon Miss Rich&rsquo;s letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Miss Flora!&rdquo; began Miss Rich, adhering to her as they parted with
      the rest at the end of the street, &ldquo;how am I to write to a principal? Am I
      to begin Reverend Sir, or My Lord, or is he Venerable, like an archdeacon?
      What is his name, and what am I to say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it is not a correspondence much in my line,&rdquo; said Flora, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! but you are so intimate with Dr. Hoxton, and your brothers at Oxford!
      You must know&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take advice,&rdquo; said Flora good-naturedly. &ldquo;Shall I come, and call
      before Friday, and tell you the result?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, pray! It will be a real favour! Good-morning&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; said Flora, as the sisters turned homewards, &ldquo;Cherry is not going
      to be turned out just yet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could you, Flora? Now they will have that man from Whitford, and you
      said not a word against it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was the use of adding to the hubbub? A little opposition would make
      them determined on having him. You will see, Ethel, we shall get the
      ground on our own terms, and then it will be time to settle about the
      mistress. If the harvest holidays were not over, we would try to send
      Cherry to a training-school, so as to leave them no excuse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate all this management and contrivance. It would be more honest to
      speak our minds, and not pretend to agree with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Ethel! have I spoken a word contrary to my opinion? It is not fit
      for me, a girl of twenty, to go disputing and dragooning as you would have
      me; but a little savoir faire, a grain of common sense, thrown in among
      the babble, always works. Don&rsquo;t you remember how Mrs. Ward&rsquo;s sister told
      us that a whole crowd of tottering Chinese ladies would lean on her,
      because they felt her firm support, though it was out of sight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel did not answer; she had self-control enough left not to retort upon
      Flora&rsquo;s estimate of herself, but the irritation was strong; she felt as if
      her cherished views for Cocksmoor were insulted, as well as set aside, by
      the place being made the occasion of so much folly and vain prattle, the
      sanctity of her vision of self-devotion destroyed by such interference,
      and Flora&rsquo;s promises did not reassure her. She doubted Flora&rsquo;s power, and
      had still more repugnance to the means by which her sister tried to
      govern; they did not seem to her straightforward, and she could not endure
      Flora&rsquo;s complacency in their success. Had it not been for her real love
      for the place and people, as well as the principle which prompted that
      love, she could have found it in her heart to throw up all concern with
      it, rather than become a fellow-worker with such a conclave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such were Ethel&rsquo;s feelings as the pair walked down the street; the one
      sister bright and smiling with the good humour that had endured many
      shocks all that day, all good nature and triumph, looking forward to
      success, great benefit to Cocksmoor, and plenty of management, with credit
      and praise to herself; the other, downcast and irritable, with annoyance
      at the interference with her schemes, at the prospects of her school, and
      at herself for being out of temper, prone to murmur or to reply tartly,
      and not able to recover from her mood, but only, as she neared the house,
      lapsing into her other trouble, and preparing to resist any misjudged,
      though kind attempt of her father, to make her unsay her rebuke to Miss
      Bracy. Pride and temper! Ah! Etheldred! where were they now?
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. May was at his study door as his daughters entered the hall, and Ethel
      expected the order which she meant to question; but, instead of this,
      after a brief inquiry after the doings of the nine muses, which Flora
      answered, so as to make him laugh, he stopped Ethel, as she was going
      upstairs, by saying, &ldquo;I do not know whether this letter is intended for
      Richard, or for me. At any rate, it concerns you most.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The envelope was addressed to the Reverend Richard May, D. D., Market
      Stoneborough, and the letter began, &ldquo;Reverend Sir.&rdquo; So far Ethel saw, and
      exclaimed, with amusement, then, with a long-drawn &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; and an
      interjection, &ldquo;My poor dear Una!&rdquo; she became absorbed, the large tears&mdash;yes,
      Ethel&rsquo;s reluctant tears gathering slowly and dropping.
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter was from a clergyman far away in the north of England, who said
      he could not, though a stranger, resist the desire to send to Dr. May an
      account of a poor girl, who seemed to have received great benefits from
      him, or from some of his family, especially as she had shown great
      eagerness on his proposing to write.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said it was nearly a year since there had come into his parish a troop
      of railwaymen and their families. For the most part, they were completely
      wild and rude, unused to any pastoral care; but, even on the first Sunday,
      he had noticed a keen-looking, freckled, ragged, unmistakably Irish girl,
      creeping into church with a Prayer-book in her hand, and had afterwards
      found her hanging about the door of the school. &ldquo;I never saw a more
      engaging, though droll, wild expression, than that with which she looked
      up to me.&rdquo; (Ethel&rsquo;s cry of delight was at that sentence&mdash;she knew
      that look too well, and had yearned after it so often!) &ldquo;I found her far
      better instructed than her appearance had led me to expect, and more truly
      impressed with the spirit of what she had learned than it has often been
      my lot to find children. She was perfect in the New Testament history&rdquo;&mdash;(&ldquo;Ah!
      that she was not, when she went away!&rdquo;)&mdash;&ldquo;and was in the habit of
      constantly attending church, and using morning and evening prayers.&rdquo; (&ldquo;Oh!
      how I longed, when she went away, to beg her to keep them up! Dear Una.&rdquo;)
      &ldquo;On my questions, as to how she had been taught, she always replied, &lsquo;Mr.
      Richard May,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Miss Athel.&rsquo; You must excuse me if I have not correctly
      caught the name from her Irish pronunciation.&rdquo; (&ldquo;I am afraid he thinks my
      name is Athaliah! But oh! this dear girl! How I have wished to hear of
      her!&rdquo;) &ldquo;Everything was answered with &lsquo;Mr. Richard,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Miss Athel&rsquo;; and,
      if I inquired further, her face would light up with a beam of gratitude,
      and she would run on, as long as I could listen, with instances of their
      kindness. It was the same with her mother, a wild, rude specimen of an
      Irishwoman, whom I never could bring to church herself, but who ran on
      loudly with their praises, usually ending with &lsquo;Heavens be their bed,&rsquo; and
      saying that Una had been quite a different girl since the young ladies and
      gentleman found her out, and put them parables in her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my own part, I can testify that, in the seven months that she
      attended my school, I never had a serious fault to find with her, but far
      more often to admire the earnestness and devout spirit, as well as the
      kindness and generosity apparent in all her conduct. Bad living, and an
      unwholesome locality, have occasioned a typhus fever among the poor
      strangers in this place, and Una was one of the first victims. Her mother,
      almost from the first, gave her up, saying she knew she was one marked for
      glory; and Una has been lying, day after day, in a sort of half-delirious
      state, constantly repeating hymns and psalms, and generally, apparently
      very happy, except when one distress occurred again and again, whether
      delirious or sensible, namely, that she had never gone to wish Miss May
      good-bye, and thank her; and that maybe she and Mr. Richard thought her
      ungrateful; and she would sometimes beg, in her phraseology, to go on her
      bare knees to Stoneborough, only to see Miss Athel again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her mother, I should say, told me the girl had been half mad at not being
      allowed to go and take leave of Miss May; and she had been sorry herself,
      but her husband had come home suddenly from the search for work, and,
      having made his arrangements, removed them at once, early the next morning&mdash;too
      early to go to the young lady; though, she said, Una did&mdash;as they
      passed through Stoneborough&mdash;run down the street before she was
      aware, and she found her sobbing, fit to break her heart, before the
      house.&rdquo; (&ldquo;Oh, why, why was I not up, and at the window! Oh, my Una! to
      think of that!&rdquo;) &ldquo;When I spoke of writing to let Miss May hear how it was,
      the poor girl caught at the idea with the utmost delight. Her weakness was
      too great to allow her to utter many words distinctly, when I asked her
      what she would have me say, but these were as well as I could understand:&mdash;&lsquo;The
      blessing of one, that they have brought peace unto. Tell them I pray, and
      will pray, that they may walk in the robe of glory&mdash;and tell Mr.
      Richard that I mind what he said to me, of taking hold on the sure hope.
      God crown all their crosses unto them, and fulfil all their desires unto
      everlasting life.&rsquo; I feel that I am not rendering her words with all their
      fervour and beauty of Irish expression, but I would that I could fully
      retain and transmit them, for those who have so led her must, indeed, be
      able to feel them precious. I never saw a more peaceful frame of penitence
      and joy. She died last night, sleeping herself away, without more apparent
      suffering, and will be committed to the earth on Sunday next, all her
      fellow-scholars attending; and, I hope, profiting by the example she has
      left.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have only to add my most earnest congratulations to those whose labour
      of love has borne such blessed fruit; and, hoping you will pardon the
      liberty, etc.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Etheldred finished the letter through blinding tears, while rising sobs
      almost choked her. She ran away to her own room, bolted the door, and
      threw herself on her knees, beside her bed&mdash;now confusedly giving
      thanks for such results&mdash;now weeping bitterly over her own
      unworthiness. Oh! what was she in the sight of Heaven, compared with what
      this poor girl had deemed her&mdash;with what this clergyman thought her?
      She, the teacher, taught, trained, and guarded, from her infancy, by her
      wise mother, and by such a father! She, to have given way all day to
      pride, jealousy, anger, selfish love of her own will; when this poor girl
      had embraced, and held fast, the blessed hope, from the very crumbs they
      had brought her! Nothing could have so humbled the distrustful spirit that
      had been working in Ethel, which had been scotched into silence&mdash;not
      killed&mdash;when she endured the bazaar, and now had been indemnifying
      itself by repining at every stumbling-block. Her own scholar&rsquo;s blessing
      was the rebuke that went most home to her heart, for having doubted
      whether good could be worked in any way, save her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was interrupted by Mary trying to open the door, and, admitting her,
      heard her wonder at the traces of her tears, and ask what there was about
      Una. Ethel gave her the letter, and Mary&rsquo;s tears showered very fast&mdash;they
      always came readily. &ldquo;Oh, Ethel, how glad Richard will be!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; it is all Richard&rsquo;s doing. So much more good, and wise, and humble,
      as he is. No wonder his teaching&mdash;&rdquo; and Ethel sat down and cried
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary pondered. &ldquo;It makes me very glad,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and yet I don&rsquo;t know
      why one cries. Ethel, do you think&rdquo;&mdash;she came near, and whispered&mdash;&ldquo;that
      Una has met dear mamma there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel kissed her. It was almost the first time Mary had spoken of her
      mother; and she answered, &ldquo;Dear Mary, we cannot tell&mdash;we may think.
      It is all one communion, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary was silent, and, next time she spoke, it was to hope that Ethel would
      tell the Cocksmoor children about Una.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel was obliged to dress, and go downstairs to tea. Her father seemed to
      have been watching for her, with his study door open, for he came to meet
      her, took her hand, and said, in a low voice, &ldquo;My dear child, I wish you
      joy. This will be a pleasant message, to bid poor Ritchie good speed for
      his ordination, will it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That it will, papa&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Ethel, have you been crying over it all this time?&rdquo; said he, struck
      by the sadness of her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Many other things, papa. I am so unworthy&mdash;but it was not our doing&mdash;but
      the grace&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but thankful you may be, to have been the means of awakening the
      grace!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel&rsquo;s lips trembled. &ldquo;And oh, papa! coming to-day, when I have been
      behaving so ill to you, and Miss Bracy, and Flora, and all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you? I did not know you had behaved ill to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About Miss Bracy&mdash;I thought wrong things, if I did not say them. To
      her, I believe, I said what was true, though it was harsh of me to say it,
      and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? about pride and temper? It was true, and I hope it will do her
      good. Cure a piping turkey with a peppercorn sometimes. I have spoken to
      her, and told her to pluck up a little spirit; not fancy affronts, and not
      to pester you with them. Poor child! you have been sadly victimised to-day
      and yesterday. No wonder you were bored past patience, with that absurd
      rabble of women!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was all my own selfish, distrustful temper, wanting to have Cocksmoor
      taken care of in my own way, and angry at being interfered with. I see it
      now&mdash;and here this poor girl, that I thought thrown away&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, Ethel, you will often see the like. The main object may fail or fall
      short, but the earnest painstaking will always be blessed some way or
      other, and where we thought it most wasted, some fresh green shoot will
      spring up, to show it is not we that give the increase. I suppose you will
      write to Richard with this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I shall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you may send this with it. Tell him my arm is tired and stiff
      to-day, or I would have said more. He must answer the clergyman&rsquo;s letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. May gave Ethel his sheet not folded. His written words were now so few
      as to be cherished amongst his children.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Richard,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May all your ministerial works be as blessed as this, your first labour
      of love. I give you hearty joy of this strengthening blessing. Mine goes
      with it&mdash;&lsquo;Only be strong and of a good courage!&rsquo;
    </p>

      CHAPTER V.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     As late, engaged by fancy&rsquo;s dream,
     I lay beside a rapid stream,
     I saw my first come gliding by,
     Its airy form soon caught my eye;
     Its texture frail, and colour various,
     Like human hopes, and life precarious.
     Sudden, my second caught my ear,
     And filled my soul with constant fear;
     I quickly rose, and home I ran,
     My whole was hissing in the pan.&mdash;Riddle.
</pre>
    <p>
      Flora revised the letter to the principal, and the Ladies&rsquo; Committee
      approved, after having proposed seven amendments, all of which Flora
      caused to topple over by their own weakness.
    </p>
    <p>
      After interval sufficient to render the nine ladies very anxious, the
      principal wrote from Scotland, where he was spending the Long Vacation,
      and informed them that their request should be laid before the next
      college meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the committee had sat upon this letter, the two sisters walked home
      in much greater harmony than after the former meeting. Etheldred had
      recovered her candour, and was willing to own that it was not art, but
      good sense, that gave her sister so much ascendancy. She began to be
      hopeful, and to declare that Flora might yet do something even with the
      ladies. Flora was gratified by the approval that no one in the house could
      help valuing; &ldquo;Positively,&rdquo; said Flora, &ldquo;I believe I may in time. You see
      there are different ways of acting, as an authority, or as an equal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The authority can move from without, the equal must from within,&rdquo; said
      Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so. We must circumvent their prejudices, instead of trying to beat
      them down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you only could have the proper catechising restored!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait; you will see. Let me feel my ground.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or if we could only abdicate into the hands of the rightful power!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The rightful power would not be much obliged to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the worst of it,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;It is sad to hear the sick people
      say that Dr. May is more to them than any parson; it shows that they have
      so entirely lost the notion of what their clergyman should be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. May is the man most looked up to in this town,&rdquo; said Flora, &ldquo;and that
      gives weight to us in the committee, but it is all in the using.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ethel hesitatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, we have the prestige of better birth, and better education, as
      well as of having the chief property in the town, and of being the largest
      subscribers, added to his personal character,&rdquo; said Flora; &ldquo;so that
      everything conspires to render us leaders, and our age alone prevented us
      from assuming our post sooner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were at home by this time, and entering the hall, perceived that the
      whole party were in the lawn. The consolation of the children for the
      departure of Hector and Tom, was a bowl of soap-suds and some tobacco
      pipes, and they had collected the house to admire and assist, even
      Margaret&rsquo;s couch being drawn close to the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bubbles is one of the most fascinating of sports. There is the soft foamy
      mass, like driven snow, or like whipped cream. Blanche bends down to blow
      &ldquo;a honeycomb,&rdquo; holding the bowl of the pipe in the water; at her gurgling
      blasts there slowly heaves upwards the pile of larger, clearer bubbles,
      each reflecting the whole scene, and sparkling with rainbow tints, until
      Aubrey ruthlessly dashes all into fragments with his hand, and Mary
      pronounces it stiff enough, and presents a pipe to little Daisy, who,
      drawing the liquid into her mouth, throws it away with a grimace, and
      declares that she does not like bubbles! But Aubrey stands with swelled
      cheeks, gravely puffing at the sealing-waxed extremity. Out pours a
      confused assemblage of froth, but the glassy globe slowly expands the
      little branching veins, flowing down on either side, bearing an enlarging
      miniature of the sky, the clouds, the tulip-tree. Aubrey pauses to
      exclaim! but where is it? Try again! A proud bubble, as Mary calls it, a
      peacock, in blended pink and green, is this transparent sphere, reflecting
      and embellishing house, wall, and shrubs! It is too beautiful! It is gone!
      Mary undertakes to give a lesson, and blows deliberately without the
      slightest result. Again! She waves her disengaged hand in silent
      exultation as the airy balls detach themselves, and float off on the
      summer breeze, with a tardy, graceful, uncertain motion. Daisy rushes
      after them, catches at them, and looks at her empty fingers with a puzzled
      &ldquo;All gone!&rdquo; as plainly expressed by Toby, who snaps at them, and shakes
      his head with offended dignity at the shock of his meeting teeth, while
      the kitten frisks after them, striking at them with her paw, amazed at
      meeting vacancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even the grave Norman is drawn in. He agrees with Mary that bubbles used
      to fly over the wall, and that one once went into Mrs. Richardson&rsquo;s garret
      window, when her housemaid tried to catch it with a pair of tongs, and
      then ran downstairs screaming that there was a ghost in her room; but that
      was in Harry&rsquo;s time, the heroic age of the May nursery.
    </p>
    <p>
      He accepts a pipe, and his greater height raises it into a favourable
      current of air&mdash;the glistening balloon sails off. It flies, it soars;
      no, it is coming down! The children shout at it, as if to drive it up, but
      it wilfully descends&mdash;they rush beneath, they try to waft it on high
      with their breath&mdash;there is a collision between Mary and Blanche&mdash;Aubrey
      perceives a taste of soapy water&mdash;the bubble is no more&mdash;it is
      vanished in his open mouth!
    </p>
    <p>
      Papa himself has taken a pipe, and the little ones are mounted on chairs,
      to be on a level with their tall elders. A painted globe is swimming
      along, hesitating at first, but the dancing motion is tending upwards, the
      rainbow tints glisten in the sunlight&mdash;all rush to assist it; if
      breath of the lips can uphold it, it should rise, indeed! Up! above the
      wall! over Mrs. Richardson&rsquo;s elm, over the topmost branch&mdash;hurrah!
      out of sight! Margaret adds her voice to the acclamations. Beat that if
      you can, Mary! That doubtful wind keeps yours suspended in a graceful
      minuet; its pace is accelerated&mdash;but earthwards! it has committed
      self-destruction by running foul of a rose-bush. A general blank!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You here, Ethel?&rdquo; said Norman, as the elders laughed at each other&rsquo;s
      baffled faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am more surprised to find you here,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excitement!&rdquo; said Norman, smiling; &ldquo;one cause is as good as another for
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very pretty sport,&rdquo; said Dr. May. &ldquo;You should write a poem on it,
      Norman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is an exhausted subject,&rdquo; said Norman; &ldquo;bubble and trouble are too
      obvious a rhyme.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! there it goes! It will be over the house! That&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; Every one
      joined in the outcry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whose is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blanche&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurrah for Blanche! Well done, white Mayflower, there!&rdquo; said the doctor,
      &ldquo;that is what I meant. See the applause gained by a proud bubble that
      flies! Don&rsquo;t we all bow down to it, and waft it up with the whole force of
      our lungs, air as it is; and when it fairly goes out of sight, is there
      any exhilaration or applause that surpasses ours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The whole world being bent on making painted bubbles fly over the house,&rdquo;
       said Norman, far more thoughtfully than his father. &ldquo;It is a fair pattern
      of life and fame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was thinking,&rdquo; continued Dr. May, &ldquo;what was the most unalloyed
      exultation I remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harry&rsquo;s, when you were made dux,&rdquo; whispered Ethel to her brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not mine,&rdquo; said Norman briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; said Dr. May, &ldquo;I never knew such glorification as when Aubrey
      Spencer climbed the poor old market-cross. We all felt ourselves made
      illustrious for ever in his person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, papa, when you got that gold medal must have been the grandest
      time?&rdquo; said Blanche, who had been listening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. May laughed, and patted her. &ldquo;I, Blanche? Why, I was excessively
      amazed, that is all, not in Norman&rsquo;s way, but I had been doing next to
      nothing to the very last, then fell into an agony, and worked like a
      horse, thinking myself sure of failure, and that my mother and my uncle
      would break their hearts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But when you heard that you had it?&rdquo; persisted Blanche.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then I found I must be a much cleverer fellow than I thought for!&rdquo;
       said he, laughing; &ldquo;but I was ashamed of myself, and of the authorities,
      for choosing such an idle dog, and vexed that other plodding lads missed
      it, who deserved it more than I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Norman, in a low voice, &ldquo;that is what one always feels.
      I had rather blow soap-bubbles!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where was Dr. Spencer?&rdquo; asked Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not competing. He had been ready a year before, and had gained it, or I
      should have had no chance. Poor Spencer! what would I not give to see him,
      or hear of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The last was&mdash;how long ago?&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Six years, when he was setting off, to return from Poonshedagore,&rdquo; said
      Dr. May, sighing. &ldquo;I gave him up; his health was broken, and there was no
      one to look after him. He was the sort of man to have a nameless grave,
      and a name too blessed for fame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel would have asked further of her father&rsquo;s dear old friend, but there
      were sounds, denoting an arrival, and Margaret beckoned to them as Miss
      Rivers and her brother were ushered into the drawing-room; and Blanche
      instantly fled away, with her basin, to hide herself in the schoolroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meta skipped out, and soon was established on the grass, an attraction to
      all the live creatures, as it seemed; for the kitten came, and was
      caressed till her own graceful Nipen was ready to fight with the uncouth
      Toby for the possession of a resting-place on the skirt of her habit,
      while Daisy nestled up to her, as claiming a privilege, and Aubrey kept
      guard over the dogs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meta inquired after a huge doll&mdash;Dr. Hoxton&rsquo;s gift to Daisy, at the
      bazaar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is in Margaret&rsquo;s wardrobe,&rdquo; was the answer, &ldquo;because Aubrey tied her
      hands behind her, and was going to offer her up on the nursery grate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Aubrey, that was too cruel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; returned Aubrey; &ldquo;she was Iphigenia, going to be sacrificed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary unconsciously acted Diana,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;and bore the victim away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, was Daisy a willing Clytemnestra?&rdquo; asked Meta.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, she liked it,&rdquo; said Aubrey, while Meta looked discomfited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never could get proper respect paid to dolls,&rdquo; said Margaret; &ldquo;we deal
      too much in their natural enemies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;my only doll was like a heraldic lion, couped in all
      her parts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harry and Tom once made a general execution,&rdquo; said Flora; &ldquo;there was a
      doll hanging to every baluster&mdash;the number made up with rag.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      George Rivers burst out laughing&mdash;his first sign of life; and Meta
      looked as if she had heard of so many murders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help feeling for a doll!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They used to be like sisters
      to me. I feel as if they were wasted on children, that see no character in
      them, and only call them Dolly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I agree with you,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;If there had been no live dolls,
      Richard and I should have reared our doll family as judiciously as
      tenderly. There are treasures of carpentry still extant, that he made for
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am so glad!&rdquo; cried Meta, as if she had found another point of
      union. &ldquo;If I were to confess&mdash;there is a dear old Rose in the secret
      recesses of my wardrobe. I could as soon throw away my sister&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; cried her brother, laying hold of the child, &ldquo;here, little Daisy,
      will you give your doll to Meta?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Gertrude Margaret May,&rdquo; said the little round mouth. The fat
      arm was drawn back, with all a baby&rsquo;s dignity, and the rosy face was
      hidden in Dr. May&rsquo;s breast, at the sound of George Rivers&rsquo;s broad laugh
      and &ldquo;Well done, little one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. May put his arm round her, turned aside from him, and began talking to
      Meta about Mr. Rivers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora and Norman made conversation for the brother; and he presently asked
      Norman to go out shooting with him, but looked so amazed on hearing that
      Norman was no sportsman that Flora tried to save the family credit by
      mentioning Hector&rsquo;s love of a gun, which caused their guest to make a
      general tender of sporting privileges; &ldquo;Though,&rdquo; added he, with a drawl,
      &ldquo;shooting is rather a nuisance, especially alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meta told Ethel, a little apart, that he was so tired of going out alone,
      that he had brought her here, in search of a companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He comes in at eleven o&rsquo;clock, poor fellow, quite tired with solitude,&rdquo;
       said she, &ldquo;and comes to me to be entertained.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; exclaimed Ethel. &ldquo;What can you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I can,&rdquo; said Meta, laughing. &ldquo;Whatever is not &lsquo;a horrid nuisance&rsquo; to
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be a horrid nuisance to me,&rdquo; said Ethel bluntly, &ldquo;if my brothers
      wanted me to amuse them all the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your brothers, oh!&rdquo; said Meta, as if that were very different; &ldquo;besides,
      you have so much more to do. I am only too glad and grateful when George
      will come to me at all. You see I have always been too young to be his
      companion, or find out what suited him, and now he is so very kind and
      good-natured to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what becomes of your business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I get time, one way or another. There is the evening, very often, when I
      have sung both him and papa to sleep. I had two hours, all to myself,
      yesterday night,&rdquo; said Meta, with a look of congratulation, &ldquo;and I had a
      famous reading of Thirlwall&rsquo;s &lsquo;Greece.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think that such evenings were as bad as the mornings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Ethel, don&rsquo;t make me naughty. Large families, like yours, may have
      merry, sociable evenings; but, I do assure you, ours are very pleasant. We
      are so pleased to have George at home; and we really hope that he is
      taking a fancy to the dear Grange. You can&rsquo;t think how delighted papa is
      to have him content to stay quietly with us so long. I must call him to go
      back now, though, or papa will be kept waiting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Ethel had watched the tall, ponderous brother help the bright fairy
      sister to fly airily into her saddle, and her sparkling glance, and wave
      of the hand, as she cantered off, contrasting with his slow bend, and
      immobility of feature, she could not help saying that Meta&rsquo;s life
      certainly was not too charming, with her fanciful, valetudinarian father,
      and that stupid, idealess brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is very amiable and good-natured,&rdquo; interposed Norman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! Norman, you are quite won by his invitation to shoot! How he despised
      you for refusing&mdash;as much as you despised him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak for yourself,&rdquo; said Norman. &ldquo;You fancy no sensible man likes
      shooting, but you are all wrong. Some of our best men are capital
      sportsmen. Why, there is Ogilvie&mdash;you know what he is. When I bring
      him down here, you will see that there is no sort of sport that he is not
      keen after.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This poor fellow will never be keen after anything,&rdquo; said Dr. May. &ldquo;I
      pity him! Existence seems hard work to him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall have baby calling him &lsquo;the detestable&rsquo; next,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;What
      a famous set down she gave him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is a thorough lady, and allows no liberties,&rdquo; said Dr. May.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;it is a proof of what I want to impression you. We
      really must leave off calling her Daisy when strangers are there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is so much nicer,&rdquo; pleaded Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The very reason,&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;fondling names should be kept for our
      innermost selves, not spread abroad, and made common. I remember when I
      used to be called Peg-top&mdash;and Flora, Flossy&mdash;we were never
      allowed to use the names when any visitor was near; and we were asked if
      we could not be as fond of each other by our proper names. I think it was
      felt that there was a want of reserve in publishing our pet words to other
      people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite true,&rdquo; said Dr. May; &ldquo;baby-names never ought to go beyond home. It
      is the fashion to use them now; and, besides the folly, it seems, to me,
      an absolute injury to a girl, to let her grow up, with a nickname attached
      to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay!&rdquo; chimed in Norman, &ldquo;I hear men talking of Henny, and Loo, and the
      like; and you can&rsquo;t think how glad I have been that my sisters could not
      be known by any absurd word!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a case where self-respect would make others behave properly,&rdquo; said
      Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Dr. May; &ldquo;but if girls won&rsquo;t keep up their own dignity, their
      friends&rsquo; duty is to do it for them. The mischief is in the intimate
      friends, who blazon the words to every one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then they call one formal, for trying to protect the right name,&rdquo;
       said Flora. &ldquo;It is, one-half of it, silliness, and, the other, affectation
      of intimacy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, I know,&rdquo; said Mary, &ldquo;why you are so careful to call Meta Miss
      Rivers, to all the people here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should hope so!&rdquo; cried Norman indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, Mary,&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;I should hope lady-like feelings would
      prevent you from calling her Meta before&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Andersons!&rdquo; cried Ethel, laughing. &ldquo;Margaret was just going to say
      it. We only want Harry, to exact the forfeit! Poor dear little
      humming-bird! It gives one an oppression on the chest, to think of her
      having that great do-nothing brother on her hands all day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Norman, &ldquo;I shall know where I am not to look when I want
      a sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;when you come yawning to me to find amusement for you,
      you will see what I shall do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand over me with a stick while I print A B C for Cocksmoor, I suppose,&rdquo;
       said Norman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! why not? People are much better doing something than nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, you won&rsquo;t even let me blow bubbles!&rdquo; said Norman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is too intellectual, as papa makes it,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;By the bye,
      Norman,&rdquo; she added, as she had now walked with him a little apart, &ldquo;it
      always was a bubble of mine that you should try for the Newdigate prize.
      Ha!&rdquo; as the colour rushed into his cheeks, &ldquo;you really have begun!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not help it, when I heard the subject given out for next year.
      Our old friend, Decius Mus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you finished?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By no means, but it brought a world of notions into my head, such as I
      could not but set down. Now, Ethel, do oblige me, do write another, as we
      used in old times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had better not,&rdquo; said Ethel, standing thoughtful. &ldquo;If I throw myself
      into it, I shall hate everything else, and my wits will be woolgathering.
      I have neither time nor poetry enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You used to write English verse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was cured of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanted money for Cocksmoor, and after persuading papa, I got leave to
      send a ballad about a little girl and a white rose to that school
      magazine. I don&rsquo;t think papa liked it, but there were some verses that
      touched him, and one had seen worse. It was actually inserted, and I was
      in high feather, till, oh, Norman! imagine Richard getting hold of this
      unlucky thing, without a notion where it came from! Margaret put it before
      him, to see what he would say to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid it was not like a young lady&rsquo;s anonymous composition in a
      story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By no means. Imagine Ritchie picking my poor metaphors to pieces, and
      weighing every sentimental line! And all in his dear old simplicity,
      because he wanted to understand it, seeing that Margaret liked it. He had
      not the least intention of hurting my feelings, but never was I so
      annihilated! I thought he was doing it on purpose, till I saw how
      distressed he was when he found it out; and worse than all was, his saying
      at the end that he supposed it was very fine, but he could not understand
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some time or other; but let me see Decius.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you give up verses because Richard could not understand them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; because I had other fish to fry. And I have not given them up
      altogether. I do scrabble down things that tease me by running in my head,
      when I want to clear my brains, and know what I mean; but I can&rsquo;t do it
      without sitting up at night, and that stupefies me before breakfast. And
      as to making bubbles of them, Ritchie has cured me of that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a pity!&rdquo; said Norman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, let me see Decius. I know he is splendid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you would have tried, for all my best ideas are stolen from you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel prevailed by following her brother to his room, and perching herself
      on the window-sill, while he read his performance from many slips of
      paper. The visions of those boyish days had not been forgotten, the
      Vesuvius scenery was much as Ethel had once described it, but with far
      more force and beauty; there was Decius&rsquo;s impassioned address to the
      beauteous land he was about to leave, and the remembrances of his Roman
      hearth, his farm, his children, whom he quitted for the pale shadows of an
      uncertain Elysium. There was a great hiatus in the middle, and Norman had
      many more authorities to consult, but the summing-up was nearly complete,
      and Ethel thought the last lines grand, as they spoke of the noble
      consul&rsquo;s name living for evermore, added to the examples that nerve ardent
      souls to devote life, and all that is precious, to the call of duty. Fame
      is not their object. She may crown their pale brows, but for the good of
      others, not their own, a beacon light to the world. Self is no object of
      theirs, and it is the casting self behind that wins&mdash;not always the
      visible earthly strife, but the combat between good and evil. They are the
      true victors, and, whether chronicled or forgotten, true glory rests on
      their heads, the sole true glory that man can attain, namely, the
      reflected beams that crown them as shadowy types of Him whom Decius knew
      not&mdash;the Prince who gave Himself for His people, and thus rendered
      death, for Truth&rsquo;s sake, the highest boon to mortal man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Norman, you must finish it! When will it be given in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Next spring, if at all, but keep the secret, Ethel. I cannot have my
      father&rsquo;s hopes raised.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you of a motto,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;Do you remember Mrs. Hemans&rsquo;
      mention of a saying of Sir Walter Scott&mdash;&lsquo;Never let me hear that
      brave blood has been shed in vain. It sends a roaring voice down through
      all time.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If,&rdquo; said Norman, rather ashamed of the enthusiasm which, almost
      approaching to the so-called &ldquo;funny state&rdquo; of his younger days, had
      trembled in his voice, and kindled his eye&mdash;&ldquo;if you won&rsquo;t let me put
      &lsquo;nascitur ridiculus mus.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too obvious,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;Depend upon it, every undergraduate has
      thought of it already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel was always very happy over Norman&rsquo;s secrets, and went about smiling
      over Decius, and comparing her brother with such a one as poor Meta was
      afflicted with; wasting some superfluous pity and contempt on the weary
      weight that was inflicted on the Grange.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of me?&rdquo; said Margaret, one afternoon. &ldquo;I have had Mr.
      George Rivers here for two hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alone! what could bring him here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told him that every one was out, but he chose to sit down, and seemed
      to be waiting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could you get on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! we asked a few questions, and brought out remarks, with great
      difficulty, at long intervals. He asked me if lying here was not a great
      nuisance, and, at last, he grew tired of twisting his moustache, and went
      away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trust it was a call to take leave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he thinks he shall sell out, for the army is a great nuisance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to have got into his confidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he said he wanted to settle down, but living with one&rsquo;s father was
      such a nuisance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the bye,&rdquo; cried Ethel, laughing, &ldquo;Margaret, it strikes me that this is
      a Dumbiedikes&rsquo; courtship!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of yourself?&rdquo; said Margaret slyly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, of Flora. You know, she has often met him at the Grange and other
      places, and she does contrive to amuse him, and make him almost animated.
      I should not think he found her a great nuisance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor man! I am sorry for him!&rdquo; said Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! rejection will be very good for him, and give him something to think
      of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flora will never let it come to that,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;But not one word
      about it, Ethel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret and Etheldred kept their eyes open, and sometimes imagined,
      sometimes laughed at themselves for their speculations, and so October
      began; and Ethel laughed, as she questioned whether the Grange would feel
      the Hussar&rsquo;s return to his quarters, as much as home would the departure
      of their scholar for Balliol.

      CHAPTER VI.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     So, Lady Flora, take my lay,
       And if you find a meaning there,
     Oh! whisper to your glass, and say,
       What wonder, if he thinks me fair.&mdash;Tennyson.
</pre>
    <p>
      Flora and Norman were dining with one of their county acquaintance, and
      Dr. May had undertaken to admit them on their return. The fire shone red
      and bright, as it sank calmly away, and the timepiece and clock on the
      stairs had begun their nightly duet of ticking, the crickets chirped in
      the kitchen, and the doctor sat alone. His book lay with unturned pages,
      as he sat musing, with eyes fixed on the fire, living over again his own
      life, the easy bright days of his youth, when, without much pains on his
      own part, the tendencies of his generous affectionate disposition, and the
      influences of a warm friendship, and an early attachment, had guarded him
      from evil&mdash;then the period when he had been perfectly happy, and the
      sobering power of his position had been gradually working on him; but
      though always religious and highly principled, the very goodness of his
      natural character preventing him from perceiving the need of self-control,
      until the shock that changed the whole tenor of his life, and left him,
      for the first time, sensible of his own responsibility, but with
      inveterate habits of heedlessness and hastiness that love alone gave him
      force to combat. He was now a far gentler man. His younger children had
      never seen, his elder had long since forgotten, his occasional bursts of
      temper, but he suffered keenly from their effects, especially as regarded
      some of his children. Though Richard&rsquo;s timidity had been overcome, and
      Tom&rsquo;s more serious failures had been remedied, he was not without anxiety,
      and had a strange unsatisfactory feeling as regarded Flora. He could not
      feel that he fathomed her! She reminded him of his old Scottish
      father-in-law, Professor Mackenzie, whom he had never understood, nor, if
      the truth were known, liked. Her dealings with the Ladies&rsquo; Committee were
      so like her grandfather&rsquo;s canny ways in a public meeting, that he laughed
      over them&mdash;but they were not congenial to him. Flora was a most
      valuable person; all that she undertook prospered, and he depended
      entirely on her for household affairs, and for the care of Margaret; but,
      highly as he esteemed her, he was a little afraid of her cool prudence;
      she never seemed to be in any need of him, nor to place any confidence in
      him, and seemed altogether so much older and wiser than he could feel
      himself&mdash;pretty girl as she was&mdash;and very pretty were her fine
      blue eyes and clear skin, set off by her dark brown hair. There arose the
      vision of eyes as blue, skin as clear, but of light blonde locks, and
      shorter, rounder, more dove-like form, open, simple, loving face, and
      serene expression, that had gone straight to his heart, when he first saw
      Maggie Mackenzie making tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard the wheels, and went out to unbolt the door. Those were a pair
      for a father to be proud of&mdash;Norman, of fine stature and noble looks,
      with his high brow, clear thoughtful eye, and grave intellectual eagle
      face, lighting into animation with his rare, sweet smile; and Flora, so
      tall and graceful, and in her white dress, picturesquely half concealed by
      her mantle, with flowers in her hair, and a deepened colour in her cheek,
      was a fair vision, as she came in from the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! was it a pleasant party?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norman related the circumstances, while his sister remained silently
      leaning against the mantel-piece, looking into the fire, until he took up
      his candle, and bade them good-night. Dr. May was about to do the same,
      when she held out her hand. &ldquo;One moment, if you please, dear papa,&rdquo; she
      said; &ldquo;I think you ought to know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, my dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. George Rivers, papa&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; said Dr. May, beginning to smile. &ldquo;So that is what he is at, is it?
      But what an opportunity to take.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was in the conservatory,&rdquo; said Flora, a little hurt, as her father
      discovered by her tone. &ldquo;The music was going on, and I don&rsquo;t know that
      there could have been&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A better opportunity, eh?&rdquo; said Dr. May, laughing; &ldquo;well, I should have
      thought it awkward; was he very much discomposed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought,&rdquo; said Flora, looking down and hesitating, &ldquo;that he had better
      come to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! so you shifted the ungracious office to me. I am very glad to
      spare you, my dear; but it was hard on him to raise his hopes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought,&rdquo; faltered Flora, &ldquo;that you could not disapprove&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flora&mdash;&rdquo; and he paused, completely confounded, while his daughter
      was no less surprised at the manner in which her news was received. Each
      waited for the other to speak, and Flora turned away, resting her head
      against the mantel-piece.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; said he, laying his hand on her shoulder, &ldquo;you do not mean that
      you like this man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not think that you would be against it,&rdquo; said Flora, in a choked
      voice, her face still averted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven knows, I would not be against anything for your happiness, my
      dear,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;but have you considered what it would be to spend
      your life with a man that has not three ideas! not a resource for
      occupying himself&mdash;a regular prey to ennui&mdash;one whom you could
      never respect!&rdquo; He had grown more and more vehement, and Flora put her
      handkerchief to her eyes, for tears of actual disappointment were flowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; he said, touched, but turning it off by a smile, &ldquo;we will
      not talk of it any more to-night. It is your first offer, and you are
      flattered, but we know
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
             &ldquo;&lsquo;Colours seen by candle-light,
              Will not bear the light of day.&rsquo;
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, good-night, Flora, my dear&mdash;we will have a-tete-a-tete in the
      study before breakfast, when you have had time to look into your own
      mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He kissed her affectionately, and went upstairs with her, stopping at her
      door to give her another embrace, and to say &ldquo;Bless you, my dear child,
      and help you to come to a right decision&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flora was disappointed. She had been too highly pleased at her conquest to
      make any clear estimation of the prize, individually considered. Her
      vanity magnified her achievement, and she had come home in a flutter of
      pleasure, at having had such a position in society offered to her, and
      expecting that her whole family would share her triumph. Gratified by
      George Rivers&rsquo;s admiration, she regarded him with favour and complacency;
      and her habit of considering herself as the most sensible person in her
      sphere made her so regard his appreciation of her, that she was blinded to
      his inferiority. It must be allowed that he was less dull with her than
      with most others.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, in the midst of her glory, when she expected her father to be
      delighted and grateful&mdash;to be received as a silly girl, ready to
      accept any proposal, her lover spoken of with scorn, and the advantages of
      the match utterly passed over, was almost beyond endurance. A physician,
      with eleven children dependent on his practice, to despise an offer from
      the heir of such a fortune! But that was his customary romance! She
      forgave him, when it occurred to her that she was too important, and
      valuable, to be easily spared; and a tenderness thrilled through her, as
      she looked at the sleeping Margaret&rsquo;s pale face, and thought of
      surrendering her and little Daisy to Ethel&rsquo;s keeping. And what would
      become of the housekeeping? She decided, however, that feelings must not
      sway her&mdash;out of six sisters some must marry, for the good of the
      rest. Blanche and Daisy should come and stay with her, to be formed by the
      best society; and, as to poor dear Ethel, Mrs. Rivers would rule the
      Ladies&rsquo; Committee for her with a high hand, and, perhaps, provide
      Cocksmoor with a school at her sole expense. What a useful, admirable
      woman she would be! The doctor would be the person to come to his senses
      in the morning, when he remembered Abbotstoke, Mr. Rivers, and Meta.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Flora met her father, the next morning, with all her ordinary
      composure, in which he could not rival her, after his sleepless, anxious
      night. His looks of affectionate solicitude disconcerted what she had
      intended to say, and she waited, with downcast eyes, for him to begin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Flora,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;have you thought?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know any cause against it?&rdquo; said Flora, still looking down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know almost nothing of him. I have never heard anything of his
      character or conduct. Those would be a subject of inquiry, if you wish to
      carry this on&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see you are averse,&rdquo; said Flora. &ldquo;I would do nothing against your
      wishes&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My wishes have nothing to do with it,&rdquo; said Dr. May. &ldquo;The point is&mdash;that
      I must do right, as far as I can, as well as try to secure your happiness;
      and I want to be sure that you know what you are about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know he is not clever,&rdquo; said Flora; &ldquo;but there may be many solid
      qualities without talent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am the last person to deny it; but where are these solid qualities? I
      cannot see the recommendation!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I place myself in your hands,&rdquo; said Flora, in a submissive tone, which
      had the effect of making him lose patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flora, Flora! why will you talk as if I were sacrificing you to some
      dislike or prejudice of my own! Don&rsquo;t you think I should only rejoice to
      have such a prosperous home offered to you, if only the man were worthy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you do not think him so, of course there is an end of it,&rdquo; said Flora,
      and her voice showed suppressed emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not what I think, in the absence of proof, but what you think,
      Flora. What I want you to do is this&mdash;to consider the matter fairly.
      Compare him with&mdash;I&rsquo;ll not say with Norman&mdash;but with Richard,
      Alan, Mr. Wilmot. Do you think you could rely on him&mdash;come to him for
      advice?&rdquo; (Flora never did come to any one for advice.) &ldquo;Above all&mdash;do
      you think him likely to be a help, or a hindrance, in doing right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you underrate him,&rdquo; said Flora steadily; &ldquo;but, of course, if you
      dislike it&mdash;though, I think, you would change your mind if you knew
      him better&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, as if to himself, &ldquo;it is not always the most worthy;&rdquo;
       then continued, &ldquo;I have no dislike to him. Perhaps I may find that you are
      right. Since your mind is made up, I will do this: first, we must be
      assured of his father&rsquo;s consent, for they may very fairly object, since
      what I can give you is a mere nothing to them. Next, I shall find out what
      character he bears in his regiment, and watch him well myself; and, if
      nothing appear seriously amiss, I will not withhold my consent. But,
      Flora, you should still consider whether he shows such principle and right
      feeling as you can trust to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, papa. I know you will do all that is kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mind, you must not consider it an engagement, unless all be
      satisfactory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do as you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel perceived that something was in agitation, but the fact did not
      break upon her till she came to Margaret, after the schoolroom reading,
      and heard Dr. May declaiming away in the vehement manner that always
      relieved him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such a cub!&rdquo; These were the words that met her ear; and she would have
      gone away, but he called her. &ldquo;Come in, Ethel; Margaret says you guessed
      at this affair!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At what affair!&rdquo; exclaimed Ethel. &ldquo;Oh, it is about Flora. Poor man; has
      he done it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor! He is not the one to be pitied!&rdquo; said her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that she likes him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She does though! A fellow with no more brains than a turnip lantern!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She does not mean it?&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she does! Very submissive, and proper spoken, of course, but bent on
      having him; so there is nothing left for me but to consent&mdash;provided
      Mr. Rivers does, and he should turn out not to have done anything
      outrageous; but there&rsquo;s no hope of that&mdash;he has not the energy. What
      can possess her? What can she see to admire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is good-natured,&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;and rather good-looking&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flora has more sense. What on earth can be the attraction?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid it is partly the grandeur&mdash;&rdquo; said Ethel. She broke off
      short, quite dismayed at the emotion she had excited. Dr. May stepped
      towards her, almost as if he could have shaken her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ethel,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t have such motives ascribed to your sister!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel tried to recollect what she had said that was so shocking, for the
      idea of Flora&rsquo;s worldly motives was no novelty to her. They had appeared
      in too many instances; and, though frightened at his anger, she stood
      still, without unsaying her words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret began to explain away. &ldquo;Ethel did not mean, dear papa&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Dr. May, his passionate manner giving way to dejection. &ldquo;The
      truth is, that I have made home so dreary, that my girls are ready to take
      the first means of escaping.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor Margaret&rsquo;s tears sprang forth, and, looking up imploringly, she
      exclaimed, &ldquo;Oh, papa, papa! it was no want of happiness! I could not help
      it. You know he had come before&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Any reproach to her had been entirely remote from his thoughts, and he was
      at once on his knee beside her, soothing and caressing, begging her
      pardon, and recalling whatever she could thus have interpreted. Meanwhile,
      Ethel stood unnoticed and silent, making no outward protestation, but with
      lips compressed, as in her heart of hearts she passed the resolution&mdash;that
      her father should never feel this pain on her account. Leave him who
      might, she would never forsake him; nothing but the will of Heaven should
      part them. It might be hasty and venturesome. She knew not what it might
      cost her; but, where Ethel had treasured her resolve to work for
      Cocksmoor, there she also laid up her secret vow&mdash;that no earthly
      object should be placed between her and her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ebullition of feeling seemed to have restored Dr. May&rsquo;s calmness, and
      he rose, saying, &ldquo;I must go to my work; the man is coming here this
      afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where shall you see him?&rdquo; Margaret asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my study, I suppose. I fear there is no chance of Flora&rsquo;s changing her
      mind first. Or do you think one of you could talk to her, and get her
      fairly to contemplate the real bearings of the matter?&rdquo; And, with these
      words, he left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret and Ethel glanced at each other; and both felt the
      impenetrability of Flora&rsquo;s nature, so smooth, that all thrusts glided off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be of no use,&rdquo; said Ethel; &ldquo;and, what is more, she will not have
      it done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray try; a few of your forcible words would set it in a new light.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why! Do you think she will attend to me, when she has not chosen to heed
      papa?&rdquo; said Ethel, with an emphasis of incredulity. &ldquo;No; whatever Flora
      does, is done deliberately, and unalterably.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still, I don&rsquo;t know whether it is not our duty,&rdquo; said Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More yours than mine,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret flushed up. &ldquo;Oh, no, I cannot!&rdquo; she said, always timid, and
      slightly defective in moral courage. She looked so nervous and shaken by
      the bare idea of a remonstrance with Flora, that Ethel could not press
      her; and, though convinced that her representation would be useless, she
      owned that her conscience would rest better after she had spoken. &ldquo;But
      there is Flora, walking in the garden with Norman,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;No doubt he
      is doing it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Ethel let it rest, and attended to the children&rsquo;s lessons, during which
      Flora came into the drawing-room, and practised her music, as if nothing
      had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the morning was over, Ethel contrived to visit Norman in the
      dining-room, where he was wont to study, and asked him whether he had made
      any impression on Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What impression do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, about this concern,&rdquo; said Ethel; &ldquo;this terrible man, that makes papa
      so unhappy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa unhappy! Why, what does he know against him? I thought the Riverses
      were his peculiar pets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Riverses! As if, because one liked the sparkling stream, one must
      like a muddy ditch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What harm do you know of him?&rdquo; said Norman, with much surprise and
      anxiety, as if he feared that he had been doing wrong, in ignorance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harm! Is he not a regular oaf?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Ethel, if you wait to marry till you find some one as clever as
      yourself, you will wait long enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it right for a woman to marry a man decidedly her
      inferior.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have all learned to think much too highly of talent,&rdquo; said Norman
      gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care for mere talent&mdash;people are generally more sensible
      without it; but, one way or other, there ought to be superiority on the
      man&rsquo;s side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, who says there is not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Norman! Why, this George Rivers is really below the average! you
      cannot deny that! Did you ever meet any one so stupid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really!&rdquo; said Norman, considering; and, speaking very innocently, &ldquo;I
      cannot see why you think so. I do not see that he is at all less capable
      of sustaining a conversation than Richard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel sat down, perfectly breathless with amazement and indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norman saw that he had shocked her very much. &ldquo;I do not mean,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;that we have not much more to say to Richard; all I meant to say was,
      merely as to the intellect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;it is not the intellect. Richard! why, you know
      how we respect, and look up to him. Dear old Ritchie! with his goodness,
      and earnestness, and right judgment&mdash;to compare him to that man!
      Norman, Norman, I never thought it of you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not understand me, Ethel. I only cited Richard, as a person who
      proves how little cleverness is needed to insure respect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, I tell you, that cleverness is not the point.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the only objection you have put forward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did wrong,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;It is not the real one. It is earnest goodness
      that one honours in Richard. Where do we find it in this man, who has
      never done anything but yawn over his self indulgence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Ethel, you are working yourself up into a state of foolish
      prejudice. You and papa have taken a dislike to him; and you are
      overlooking a great deal of good safe sense and right thinking. I know his
      opinions are sound, and his motives right. He has been undereducated, we
      all see, and is not very brilliant or talkative; but I respect Flora for
      perceiving his solid qualities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very solid and weighty, indeed!&rdquo; said Ethel ironically. &ldquo;I wonder if she
      would have seen them in a poor curate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ethel, you are allowing yourself to be carried, by prejudice, a great
      deal too far. Are such imputations to be made, wherever there is
      inequality of means? It is very wrong! very unjust!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So papa said,&rdquo; replied Ethel, as she looked sorrowfully down. &ldquo;He was
      very angry with me for saying so. I wish I could help feeling as if that
      were the temptation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought,&rdquo; said Norman. &ldquo;You will be sorry, if you set yourself, and
      him, against it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only wish you to know what I feel; and, I think, Margaret and papa do,&rdquo;
       said Ethel humbly; &ldquo;and then you will not think us more unjust than we
      are. We cannot see anything so agreeable or suitable in this man as to
      account for Flora&rsquo;s liking, and we do not feel convinced of his being good
      for much. That makes papa greatly averse to it, though he does not know
      any positive reason for refusing; and we cannot feel certain that she is
      doing quite right, or for her own happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be convinced,&rdquo; said Norman cheerfully. &ldquo;You will find out the
      good that is under the surface when you have seen more of him. I have had
      a good deal of talk with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A good deal of talk to him would have been more correct, if Norman had but
      been aware of it. He had been at the chief expense of the conversation
      with George Rivers, and had taken the sounds of assent, which he obtained,
      as evidences of his appreciation of all his views. Norman had been
      struggling so long against his old habit of looking down on Richard, and
      exalting intellect; and had seen, in his Oxford life, so many ill-effects
      of the knowledge that puffeth up, that he had come to have a certain
      respect for dullness, per se, of which George Rivers easily reaped the
      benefit, when surrounded by the halo, which everything at Abbotstoke
      Grange bore in the eyes of Norman.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was heartily delighted at the proposed connection, and his genuine
      satisfaction not only gratified Flora, and restored the equanimity that
      had been slightly disturbed by her father, but it also reassured Ethel and
      Margaret, who could not help trusting in his judgment, and began to hope
      that George might be all he thought him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel, finding that there were two ways of viewing the gentleman, doubted
      whether she ought to express her opinion. It was Flora&rsquo;s disposition, and
      the advantages of the match, that weighed most upon her, and, in spite of
      her surmise having been treated as so injurious, she could not rid herself
      of the burden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. May was not so much consoled by Norman&rsquo;s opinion as Ethel expected.
      The corners of his mouth curled up a little with diversion, and though he
      tried to express himself glad, and confident in his son&rsquo;s judgment, there
      was the same sort of involuntary lurking misgiving with which he had
      accepted Sir Matthew Fleet&rsquo;s view of Margaret&rsquo;s case.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no danger that Dr. May would not be kind and courteous to the
      young man himself. It was not his fault if he were a dunce, and Dr. May
      perceived that his love for Flora was real, though clumsily expressed. He
      explained that he could not sanction the engagement till he should be
      better informed of the young gentleman&rsquo;s antecedents; this was, as George
      expressed it, a great nuisance, but his father agreed that it was quite
      right, in some doubt, perhaps, as to how Dr. May might be satisfied.

      CHAPTER VII.

     Ye cumbrous fashions, crowd not on my head.
     Mine be the chip of purest white,
     Swan-like; and, as her feathers light,
     When on the still wave spread;
     And let it wear the graceful dress
     Of unadorned simpleness.
                            Catherine Fanshaw&rsquo;s &lsquo;Parody on Grey&rsquo;.
</pre>
    <p>
      Nothing transpired to the discredit of Lieutenant Rivers. He had spent a
      great deal of money, but chiefly for want of something else to do, and,
      though he was not a subject for high praise, there was no vice in him&mdash;no
      more than in an old donkey&mdash;as Dr. May declared, in his concluding
      paroxysm of despair, on finding that, though there was little to reconcile
      him to the engagement, there was no reasonable ground for thwarting his
      daughter&rsquo;s wishes. He argued the matter once more with her, and, finding
      her purpose fixed, he notified his consent, and the rest of the family
      were admitted to a knowledge of the secret which they had never suspected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Etheldred could not help being gratified with the indignation it excited.
      With one voice, Mary and Blanche declared that they would never give up
      the title of &ldquo;the detestable,&rdquo; and would not make him any presents;
      certainly not watch-chains! Miss Bracy, rather alarmed, lectured them just
      enough to make them worse; and Margaret, overhearing Blanche instructing
      Aubrey in her own impertinences, was obliged to call her to her sofa, and
      assure her that she was unkind to Flora, and that she must consider Mr.
      George Rivers as her brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never my brother like Harry!&rdquo; exclaimed Mary indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed; nor like Alan!&rdquo; exclaimed Blanche. &ldquo;And I won&rsquo;t call him
      George, I am determined, if it is ever so!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will not matter to him what such little girls call him,&rdquo; said
      Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blanche was so annihilated, that the sound of a carriage, and of the door
      bell, was a great satisfaction to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meta Rivers came flying into the room, her beautiful eyes dancing, and her
      cheeks glowing with pleasure, as, a little timidly, she kissed Margaret;
      while Ethel, in a confused way, received Mr. Rivers, in pain for her own
      cold, abrupt manner, in contrast with his gentle, congratulating
      politeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meta asked, blushing, and with a hesitating voice, for their dear Flora;
      Mary offered to call her, but Meta begged to go herself, and thus was
      spared the awkwardness that ensued. Ethel was almost vexed with herself,
      as ungrateful, when she saw Mr. Rivers so mildly kind, and so delighted,
      with the bland courtesy that seemed fully conscious of the favour that
      Flora had conferred on his son, and thankful to the Mays for accepting
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret answered with more expression of gratification than would have
      been sincere in Ethel; but it was a relief when Flora and Meta came in
      together, as pretty a contrast as could be seen; the little dark-eyed
      fairy, all radiant with joy, clinging to the slender waist of Flora, whose
      quiet grace and maidenly dignity were never more conspicuous than as, with
      a soft red mantling in her fair cheek, her eyes cast down, but with a
      simple, unaffected warmth of confidence and gratitude, she came forward to
      receive Mr. Rivers&rsquo;s caressing affectionate greeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stiffness was over when she came in, and Dr. May, who presently made his
      appearance, soon was much more at his ease than could have been hoped,
      after his previous declarations that he should never be able to be
      moderately civil about it to Mr. Rivers. People of ready sympathy, such as
      Dr. May and Margaret, have a great deal of difficulty with their sincerity
      spared them, by being carried along with the feelings of others. Ethel
      could not feel the same, and was bent on avoiding any expression of
      opinion; she hoped that Meta&rsquo;s ecstasies would all be bestowed upon her
      future sister-in-law; but Meta was eager for an interview with Ethel
      herself, and, as usual, gained her point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now then, you are property of my own!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;May I not take you all
      for sisters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel had not thought of this as a convenience of the connection, and she
      let Meta kiss her, and owned that it was very nice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ethel,&rdquo; said Meta, &ldquo;I see, and I wanted to talk to you. You don&rsquo;t think
      poor George good enough for Flora.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never meant to show it,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need not mind,&rdquo; said Meta, smiling. &ldquo;I was very much surprised
      myself, and thought it all a mistake. But I am so very glad, for I know it
      will make such a difference to him, poor fellow. I should like to tell you
      all about him, for no one else can very well, and you will like him
      better, perhaps. You know my grandfather made his own fortune, and you
      would think some of our relations very queer. My Aunt Dorothy once told me
      all about it&mdash;papa was made to marry the partner&rsquo;s daughter, and I
      fancy she could not have been much of a lady. I don&rsquo;t think he could have
      been very happy with her, but she soon died, and left him with this one
      son, whom those odd old aunts brought up their own way. By and by, you
      know, papa came to be in quite another line of society, but when he
      married again, poor George had been so spoiled by these aunts, and was so
      big, and old, that my mother did not know what to make of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A great lubberly boy,&rdquo; Ethel said, rather repenting the next moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is thirteen years older than I am,&rdquo; said Meta, &ldquo;and you see it has
      been hard on him altogether; he had not the education that papa would have
      given him if he had been born later: and he can&rsquo;t remember his mother, and
      has always been at a loss when with clever people. I never understood it
      till within the last two or three years, nor knew how trying it must be to
      see such a little chit as me made so much of&mdash;almost thrusting him
      aside. But you cannot think what a warm-hearted good fellow he is&mdash;he
      has never been otherwise than so very kind to me, and he was so very fond
      of his old aunt. Hitherto, he has had such disadvantages, and no real,
      sensible woman has taken him in hand; he does not care for papa&rsquo;s tastes,
      and I am so much younger, that I never could get on with him at all, till
      this time; but I do know that he has a real good temper, and all sorts of
      good qualities, and that he only needs to be led right, to go right. Oh!
      Flora may make anything of him, and we are so thankful to her for having
      found it out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you for telling me,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;It is much more satisfactory to
      have no shamming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meta laughed, for Ethel&rsquo;s sham was not too successful; she continued,
      &ldquo;Dear Dr. May, I thought he would think his beautiful Flora not exactly
      matched&mdash;but tell him, Ethel, for if he once is sorry for poor
      George, he will like him. And it will really be the making of George, to
      be thrown with him and your brothers. Oh! we are so glad! But I won&rsquo;t
      tease you to be so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can like it better now,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;You know Norman thinks very
      highly of your brother, and declares that it will all come out by and by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meta clapped her hands, and said that she should tell her father, and
      Ethel parted with her, liking her, at least, better than ever. There was a
      comical scene between her and the doctor, trying to define what relations
      they should become to each other, which Ethel thought did a good deal to
      mollify her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      The history of George&rsquo;s life did more; he took to pitying him, and pity
      was, indeed, akin to love in the good doctor&rsquo;s mind. In fact, George was a
      man who could be liked, when once regarded as a belonging&mdash;a
      necessity, not a choice; for it was quite true that there was no harm in
      him, and a great deal of good nature. His constant kindness, and evident
      liking for Margaret, stood him in good stead; he made her a sort of
      confidante, bestowing on her his immeasurable appreciation of Flora&rsquo;s
      perfections, and telling her how well he was getting on with &ldquo;the old
      gentleman&rdquo;&mdash;a name under which she failed to recognise her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to Tom, he wrote his congratulations to Ethel, that she might make a
      wedding present of her Etruscan vases, the Cupids on which must have been
      put there by anticipation. Richard heard none of the doubts, and gave
      kind, warm congratulations, promising to return home for the wedding; and
      Mary and Blanche no sooner heard a whisper about bride&rsquo;s-maids than all
      their opposition faded away, in a manner that quite scandalised Ethel,
      while it set Margaret on reminiscences of her having been a six-year-old
      bride&rsquo;s-maid to Flora&rsquo;s godmother, Mrs. Arnott.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the gossip in the town, Ethel quite dreaded the sight of every one
      without Flora to protect her, and certainly, Flora&rsquo;s unaffected, quiet
      manner was perfection, and kept off all too forward congratulations, while
      it gratified those whom she was willing to encourage.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no reason for waiting, and Mr. Rivers was as impatient as his
      son, so an understanding arose that the wedding, should take place near
      the end of the Christmas holidays.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora showed herself sensible and considerate. Always open-handed, her
      father was inclined to do everything liberally, and laid no restrictions
      on her preparations, but she had too much discretion to be profuse, and
      had a real regard for the welfare of the rest. She laughed with Ethel at
      the anticipations of the Stoneborough ladies that she must be going to
      London, and, at the requests, as a great favour, that they might be
      allowed the sight of her trousseau. Her wedding-dress, white silk, with a
      white cashmere mantle, was, indeed, ordered from Meta&rsquo;s London dressmaker;
      but, for the rest, she contented herself with an expedition to Whitford,
      accompanied by Miss Bracy and her two enchanted pupils, and there laid in
      a stock of purchases, unpretending and in good taste, aiming only at what
      could be well done, and not attempting the decorative wardrobe of a great
      lady. Ethel was highly amused when the Misses Anderson came for their
      inspection, to see their concealed disappointment at finding no under
      garments trimmed with Brussels lace, nor pocket-handkerchiefs all
      open-work, except a centre of the size of a crown-piece, and the only
      thing remarkable was Margaret&rsquo;s beautiful marking in embroidery. There was
      some compensation in the costly wedding presents&mdash;Flora had reaped a
      whole harvest from friends of her own, grateful patients of her father,
      and the whole Rivers and Langdale connection; but, in spite of the
      brilliant uselessness of most of these, the young ladies considered
      themselves ill-used, thought Dr. May never would have been shabby, and
      were of opinion that when Miss Ward had married her father&rsquo;s surgical
      pupil, her outfit had been a far more edifying spectacle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same moderation influenced Flora&rsquo;s other arrangements. Dr. May was
      resigned to whatever might be thought most proper, stipulating only that
      he should not have to make a speech; but Flora felt that, in their house,
      a grand breakfast would be an unsuccessful and melancholy affair. If the
      bride had been any one else, she could have enjoyed making all go off
      well, but, under present circumstances, it would be great pain to her
      father and Margaret, a misery to Ethel, and something she dared not think
      of to the guests. She had no difficulty in having it dispensed with.
      George was glad to avoid &ldquo;a great nuisance.&rdquo; Mr. Rivers feared the
      fatigue, and, with his daughter, admired Flora for her amiability, and, as
      to the home party, no words could express their gratitude to her for
      letting them off. Mary and Blanche did, indeed, look rather blank, but
      Blanche was consoled, by settling with Hector the splendours in store for
      Alan and Margaret, and Mary cared the less, as there would be no Harry to
      enjoy the fun.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bride-maiden&rsquo;s glory was theirs by right, though Ethel was an
      unsatisfactory chief for such as desired splendour. She protested against
      anything incongruous with January, or that could not be useful afterwards,
      and Meta took her part, laughing at the cruel stroke they were preparing
      for Bellairs. Ethel begged for dark silks and straw bonnets, and Flora
      said that she had expected to hear of brown stuff and gray duffle, but
      owned that they had better omit the ordinary muslin garb in the heart of
      winter. The baby bride&rsquo;s-maid was, at last, the chief consideration.
      Margaret suggested how pretty she and Blanche would look in sky-blue
      merino, trimmed with swan&rsquo;s-down. Meta was charmed with the idea, and
      though Ethel stuck out her shoulder-blades and poked out her head, and
      said she should look like the ugly duckling, she was clamorously reminded
      that the ugly duckling ended by being a swan, and promised that she should
      be allowed a bonnet of a reasonable size, trimmed with white, for Mr.
      Rivers&rsquo;s good taste could endure, as little as Dr. May&rsquo;s sense of
      propriety, the sight of a daughter without shade to her face, Ethel,
      finally, gave in, on being put in mind that her papa had a penchant for
      swan&rsquo;s-down, and on Margaret&rsquo;s promising to wear a dress of the same as
      theirs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel was pleased and satisfied by Flora&rsquo;s dislike of parade, and
      attention to the feelings of all. Passing over the one great fact, the two
      sisters were more of one mind than usual, probably because all latent
      jealousy of Ethel had ceased in Flora&rsquo;s mind. Hitherto, she had preferred
      the being the only practically useful person in the family, and had
      encouraged the idea of Ethel&rsquo;s gaucherie but now she desired to render her
      sister able to take her place, and did all in her power to put her in good
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Etheldred was terrified at the prospect of becoming responsible
      housekeeper. Margaret could only serve as an occasional reference. Her
      morning powers became too uncertain to be depended on for any regular,
      necessary duty, and it would have oppressed her so much to order the
      dinners, which she never saw, that, though she offered to resume the
      office, Flora would not hear of Ethel&rsquo;s consenting. If it were her proper
      business, Ethel supposed she could do it, but another hour of her leisure
      was gone, and what would become of them all, with her, a proverb for
      heedlessness, and ignorance of ordinary details. She did not know that
      these were more proverbial than actual, and, having a bad name, she
      believed in it herself. However, Flora made it her business to persuade
      her that her powers were as good for household matters, as for books, or
      Cocksmoor; instructed her in her own methodical plans, and made her keep
      house for a fortnight, with so much success that she began to be hopeful.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the attendance on Margaret, the other great charge, old nurse was the
      security; and Ethel, who had felt her self much less unhandy than before,
      was, to succeed to the abode, in her room&mdash;Blanche being promoted
      from the nursery to the old attic. &ldquo;And,&rdquo; said Flora consolingly, &ldquo;if dear
      Margaret ever should be ill, you may reckon on me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Flora May made her last appearance at the Ladies&rsquo; Committee to hear
      the reply from the principal of the college. It was a civil letter, but
      declined taking any steps in the matter without more certain intelligence
      of the wishes of the incumbent of the parish or of the holders of the land
      in question.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ladies abused all colleges&mdash;as prejudiced old Bodies, and feared
      that it would be impossible to ask Mrs. Perkinson&rsquo;s niece to take the
      school while there was neither room nor lodging. So Miss Rich recorded the
      correspondence, and the vote of censure, by which it was to be hoped the
      Ladies&rsquo; Committee of Market Stoneborough inflicted a severe blow on the
      principal and fellows of M&mdash;&mdash; College.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, Ethel,&rdquo; said Flora. &ldquo;I shall meet Sir Henry Walkinghame in
      London, and will talk to him. We shall yet astonish the muses. If we can
      get the land without them, we shall be able to manage it our own way,
      without obligations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forget the money!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will keep them from dissipating it&mdash;or that might be no harm! A
      hundred pounds will be easily found, and we should then have it in our own
      hands. Besides, you know, I don&rsquo;t mean to give up. I shall write a polite
      note to Mrs. Ledwich, begging to subscribe on my own account, and to
      retain my seat! and you will see what we shall do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean to come down with the external authority,&rdquo; said Ethel, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True! and though my driving in with a pair of horses may make little
      difference to you, Ethel, depend upon it, Mrs. Ledwich will be the more
      amenable. Whenever I want to be particularly impressive, I shall bring in
      that smelling-bottle, with the diamond stopper that won&rsquo;t come out, and
      you will find that carries all before it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A talisman!&rdquo; said Ethel, laughing. &ldquo;But I had rather they yielded to a
      sense of right!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So had I,&rdquo; said Flora. &ldquo;Perhaps you will rule them that way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I!&rdquo; cried Ethel, terrified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you must come to me, and secondary motives. Seriously&mdash;I do
      mean that George should do something for Stoneborough; and, in a position
      of influence, I hope to be able to be useful to my poor old town. Perhaps
      we shall have the minster restored.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flora did wish it. She did love Stoneborough, and was sincerely interested
      for Cocksmoor. She thought she worked earnestly for them, and that her
      situation would be turned to their profit; but there was something for
      which she worked more earnestly. Had Flora never heard of the two masters
      whom we cannot serve at the same time?
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard came home for &ldquo;a parson&rsquo;s week,&rdquo; so as to include the wedding. He
      looked very fresh and youthful; but his manner, though still gentle and
      retiring, had lost all that shrinking diffidence, and had, now, a very
      suitable grave composure. Everybody was delighted to have him; and Ethel,
      more than any one, except Margaret. What floods of Cocksmoor histories
      were poured upon him; and what comparing of notes about his present
      school-children! He could not enter into the refinements of her dread of
      the Ladies&rsquo; Committee, and thought she might be thankful if the school
      were built by any proper means; for, if Cherry Elwood were retained, and
      the ladies prevented from doing harm, he did not understand why Ethel
      should wish to reject all assistance that did not come in a manner she
      admired. He never would comprehend&mdash;so Ethel gave it up&mdash;feared
      she was again jealous and self-sufficient, and contented herself with the
      joy that his presence produced at Cocksmoor, where the children smiled,
      blushed, and tittered, with ecstasy, whenever he even looked at one of
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard was not allowed to have a Sunday of rest. His father apologised
      for having made an engagement for him&mdash;as Mr. Ramsden was unwell, and
      the school clergy were all absent, so that he could do no otherwise than
      assist in the service. Richard coloured, and said that he had brought no
      sermon; and he was, in fact, deprived of much of his sister&rsquo;s company, for
      composition was not easy to him, and the quantity of time he spent on it,
      quite alarmed Norman and Ethel, who both felt rather nervous on the Sunday
      morning, but agreed that preaching was not everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel could not see well as far as the reading-desk, but she saw her
      father glance up, take off his spectacles, wipe them, and put them away;
      and she could not be displeased, though she looked reproof at Blanche&rsquo;s
      breathless whisper, &ldquo;Oh, he looks so nice!&rdquo; Those white folds did truly
      suit well with the meek, serious expression of the young deacon&rsquo;s fair
      face, and made him, as his sisters afterwards said, like one of the
      solemnly peaceful angel-carvings of the earlier ages.
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice was sweet and clear, and his reading full of quiet simplicity
      and devotion, such as was not often heard by that congregation, who were
      too much used either to carelessness or to pomposity. The sermon made his
      brother and sister ashamed of their fears. It was an exposition of the
      Gospel for the day, practical and earnest, going deep, and rising high,
      with a clearness and soberness, yet with a beauty and elevation, such as
      Norman and Ethel had certainly not expected&mdash;or, rather, they forgot
      all their own expectations and Richard himself, and only recollected their
      own hearts and the great future before them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even Blanche and Aubrey told Margaret a great deal about it, and declared
      that, if Richard preached every Sunday, they should like going to church
      much better.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Dr. May came in, some time after, he was looking much pleased. &ldquo;So,
      Mr. Ritchie,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you have made quite a sensation&mdash;every one
      shaking me by the hand, and thanking me for my son&rsquo;s sermon. You will be a
      popular preacher at last!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard blushed distressfully, and quoted the saying, that it would be the
      true comfort to hear that people went home, thinking of themselves rather
      than of the sermon. This put an end to the subject; but the doctor went
      over it again, most thoroughly, with his other children, who were greatly
      delighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora&rsquo;s last home Sunday! She was pale and serious, evidently feeling
      much, though seeking no tete-a-tetes; and chiefly engrossed with waiting
      on Margaret, or fondling little Gertrude. No one saw the inside of her
      mind&mdash;probably, she did not herself. On the outside was a very
      suitable pensiveness, and affection for all that she was leaving. The only
      one in the family to whom she talked much was Norman, who continued to see
      many perfections in George, and contrived, by the force of his belief, to
      impress the same on the others, and to make them think his great talent
      for silence such a proof of his discretion, that they were not staggered,
      even by his shy blundering exclamation that his wedding would be a great
      nuisance&mdash;a phrase which, as Dr. May observed, was, to him, what
      Est-il-possible was to his namesake of Denmark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody wished for any misgivings, so Richard was never told of any, though
      there was a careful watch kept to see what were his first impressions.
      None transpired, except something about good nature, but it was shrewdly
      believed that Richard and George, being much alike in shy unwillingness to
      speak, had been highly satisfied with the little trouble they had caused
      to each other, and so had come to a tacit esteem.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was very little bustle of preparation. Excepting the packing,
      everything went on much as usual, till the Thursday morning, and then the
      children were up early, refreshing the Christmas hollies, and working up
      their excitement, only to have it damped by the suppressed agitation of
      their elders at the breakfast-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. May did not seem to know what he was about; and Flora looked paler and
      paler. She went away before the meal was over, and when Ethel went to the
      bedroom, shortly after, she found that she had fairly broken down, and was
      kneeling beside Margaret&rsquo;s sofa, resting her head on her sister&rsquo;s bosom,
      and sobbing&mdash;as Ethel had never seen her weep, except on that
      dreadful night, after their mother&rsquo;s death.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a person ordinarily of such self-command as Flora, weeping was a
      terrible thing, and Margaret was much distressed and alarmed; but the
      worst had passed before Ethel came up, and Flora was able to speak. &ldquo;Oh!
      Margaret! I cannot leave you! Oh! how happy we have been&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are going to be happier, we trust, dearest,&rdquo; said Margaret fondly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! what have I done? It is not worth it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel thought she caught those words, but no more. Mary&rsquo;s step was heard,
      and Flora was on her feet, instantly, composing herself rapidly. She shed
      no more tears, but her eyelids were very heavy, and her face softened, in
      a manner that, though she was less pretty than usual, was very becoming
      under her bridal veil. She recovered calmness and even cheerfulness, while
      reversing the usual order of things, and dressing her bride&rsquo;s-maids, who
      would never have turned out fit to be seen, but for the exertions of
      herself, Margaret, and Miss Bracy. Ethel&rsquo;s long Scotch bones and Mary&rsquo;s
      round, dumpy shapelessness were, in their different ways, equally hard to
      overcome; and the one was swelled out with a fabulous number of
      petticoats, and the other pinched in, till she gasped and screamed for
      mercy, while Blanche and Gertrude danced about, beautiful to behold, under
      their shady hats; and presently, with a light tap at the door, Meta Rivers
      stepped in, looking so pretty, that all felt that to try to attain to such
      an appearance was vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Timid in her affection, she hardly dared to do more than kiss them, and
      whisper her pretty caressing words to each. There was no more time&mdash;Dr.
      Hoxton&rsquo;s carriage was come to take up the bride.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel did as she was told, without much volition of her own; and she
      quitted the carriage, and was drawn into her place by Norman, trusting
      that Meta would not let her do wrong, and relieved that just in front of
      her were the little ones, over whose heads she could see her father, with
      Flora&rsquo;s veiled bending figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      That pause while the procession was getting into order, the slow movement
      up the centre aisle, the week-day atmosphere of the church, brought back
      to her thoughts a very different time, and one of those strange echoings
      on the mind repeated in her ears the words, &ldquo;For man walketh in a vain
      shadow, and disquieteth himself in vain&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a little pause&mdash;George did not seem to be forthcoming, and
      Meta turned round, rather uneasily, and whispered something about his
      having been so nervous. However, there he was, looking exceedingly red,
      and very sheepish, and disposed to fall back on his best man, Norman,
      whose countenance was at the brightest&mdash;and almost handsome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Hoxton performed the ceremony, &ldquo;assisted by&rdquo; Richard. It had been
      Flora&rsquo;s choice; and his loud sonorous voice was thought very impressive.
      Blanche stood the nearest, and looked happy and important, with Flora&rsquo;s
      glove. Gertrude held Mary&rsquo;s hand, and gazed straight up into the fretted
      roof, as if that were to her the chief marvel. Ethel stood and knelt, but
      did not seem, to herself, to have the power of thinking or feeling. She
      saw and heard&mdash;that was all; she could not realise.
    </p>
    <p>
      They drew her forward, when it was over, to sign her name, as witness. She
      took up the pen, looked at the Flora May, written for the last time, and
      found her hand so trembling, that she said, half smiling, that she could
      not write. Mary was only too well pleased to supply the deficiency. Dr.
      May looked at her anxiously, and asked whether she felt overcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, papa. I did not know my hand was shaky.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took it into his, and pressed it. Ethel knew, then, how much had been
      undeveloped in her own mind, catching it, as it were, from his touch and
      look. The thought of his past joy&mdash;the sad fading of hope for
      Margaret&mdash;the fear and doubt for their present bride&mdash;above all,
      the sense that the fashion of this world passeth away; and that it is not
      the outward scene, but our bearing in it, that is to last for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bells struck up, each peal ending with a crash that gave Ethel some
      vague idea of fatality; and they all came back to the house, where
      Margaret was ready, in the drawing-room, to receive them, looking very
      pretty, in her soft blue dress, which especially became her fair
      complexion and light brown hair. Ethel did not quite like the pink colour
      on her cheeks, and feared that she had been shaken by Flora&rsquo;s agitation in
      the morning; but she was very calm and bright, in the affectionate
      greeting with which she held out her hands to the bride and bridegroom, as
      they came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Rivers and Meta were the only guests, and, while Meta was seized by
      the children, Margaret lay talking to Mr. Rivers, George standing upright
      and silent behind her sofa, like a sentinel. Flora was gone to change her
      dress, not giving way, but nervous and hurried, as she reiterated parting
      directions about household comforts to Ethel, who stood by the
      toilette-table, sticking a pin into the pincushion and drawing it out
      again, as if solely intent on making it always fit into the same hole,
      while Mary dressed Flora, packed, flew about, and was useful.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they came downstairs, Ethel found that Flora was trembling from head to
      foot, and leaning on her; Dr. May stood at the foot of the stairs, and
      folded his daughter in a long embrace; Flora gave herself up to it as if
      she would never bear to leave it. Did a flash come over her then, what the
      father was, whom she had held cheaply? what was the worth of that for
      which she had exchanged such a home? She spoke not a word, she only clung
      tightly&mdash;if her heart failed her&mdash;it was too late. &ldquo;Bless you!
      my child!&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;Only be what your mother was!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A coming tread warned them to part. There was a tray of luncheon for the
      two who were about to depart, and the great snow-white cake was waiting
      for Flora to cut it. She smiled, accomplished that feat steadily, and
      Norman continuing the operation, Aubrey guided Gertrude in handing round
      the slices. George did full justice thereto, as well as to the more solid
      viands. Flora could taste nothing, but she contrived to smile and say it
      was too early. She was in haste to have it over now, and, as soon as
      George had finished, she rose up, still composed and resolved, the last
      kisses were given&mdash;Gertrude was lifted up to her, after she was in
      the carriage for the very last, when George proposed to run away with her
      also, whereupon Daisy kicked and screamed, and was taken back in haste.
      The door was shut, and they drove off, bound for the Continent, and then
      Mary, as if the contingency of losing Flora had only for the first time
      occurred to her as the consequence of the wedding, broke out into a
      piteous fit of sobbing&mdash;rather too unrestrained, considering her
      fourteen years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Mary, she was a very child still! They pulled her into the study, out
      of the way of Mr. Rivers, and Meta had no sooner said how Flora would soon
      come home and live at the Grange, and talked of the grand school-feast to
      which she was at once going to take her friends, than the round rosy face
      drew out of its melancholy puckers into smiles, as Mary began to tell the
      delight caused by the invitations which she had conveyed. That was to be a
      feast indeed&mdash;all the Abbotstoke children&mdash;all Flora&rsquo;s class at
      Stoneborough, and as many Cocksmoor scholars as could walk so far, were to
      dine on Christmas fare, at one o&rsquo;clock, at the Grange, and Meta was in
      haste to be at home to superintend the feast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary, Blanche, and Aubrey, went with her, under the keeping of Miss Bracy,
      the boys were to follow. She had hoped for Ethel, but on looking at her,
      ceased her coaxing importunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; she said kindly; &ldquo;even schoolchildren will not be so good for you
      as peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;I should like to be quiet till the evening, if
      you will let me off. It is very kind in you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ought to know how to pity you,&rdquo; said Meta, &ldquo;I who have gained what you
      have lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to think too,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;It is the beginning to me of a new
      life, and I have not been able to look at it yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides, Margaret will want you. Poor Margaret&mdash;has it been very
      trying to her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear so, but I shall keep out of her way, and leave her to a quiet
      afternoon with Richard. It will be the greatest treat to those two to be
      together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, I will carry off the children, and leave the house quiet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And quiet it was in another hour&mdash;Gertrude walking with the nurses,
      Dr. May gone to his patients, and all the rest at Abbotstoke, except
      Richard and Margaret downstairs; and Ethel, who, while arranging her
      properties in her new room, had full leisure to lay out before herself the
      duties that had devolved on her and to grapple with them. She recalled the
      many counsels that she had received from Flora, and they sounded so
      bewildering that she wished it had been Conic sections, and then she
      looked at a Hebrew grammar that Norman had given her, and gave a sigh as
      she slipped it into the shelf of the seldom used. She looked about the
      room, cleared out the last piece of brown paper, and burned the last torn
      envelope, that no relic of packing and change might distress Margaret&rsquo;s
      eyes for order; then feeling at once desolate and intrusive, she sat down
      in Flora&rsquo;s fireside chair, opened her desk, and took out her last
      time-table. She looked at it for some minutes, laid it aside, and rising,
      knelt down. Again seating herself, she resumed her paper, took a blank
      one, ruled it, and wrote her rules for each hour of each day in the week.
      That first hour after breakfast, when hitherto she had been free, was one
      sacrifice; it must go now, to ordering dinner, seeing after stores,
      watching over the children&rsquo;s clothes, and the other nondescripts, which,
      happily for her, Flora had already reduced to method. The other loss was
      the spare time between the walk and tea; she must not spend that in her
      own room now, or there would be no one to sit with Margaret, or keep the
      little ones from being troublesome to her. Ethel had often had to give up
      this space before, when Flora went out in the evening, and she had seldom
      felt otherwise than annoyed. Give it up for good! that was the cure for
      temper, but it had been valuable as something of her own. She would have
      been thankful could she have hoped to keep regularly to her own rules, but
      that she knew was utterly improbable&mdash;boys, holidays, callers,
      engagements, Dr. May, would all conspire to turn half her days upside
      down, and Cocksmoor itself must often depend not only on the weather, but
      on home doings. Two or three notes she wrote at the foot of her paper.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;N. B.  These are a standard&mdash;not a bed of Procrustes.
   MUSTS&mdash;To be first consulted.&mdash;Mays&mdash;last.  Ethel May&rsquo;s
          last of all.
          If I cannot do everything&mdash;omit the self-chosen.
   MEM&mdash;  Neither hurry when it depends on myself,
          nor fidget when it depends on others.
   Keep a book going to pacify myself.&rsquo;
</pre>
    <p>
      Her rules drawn up, Ethel knelt once more. Then she drew a long sigh, and
      wondered where Flora was; and next, as she was fairly fagged, mind and
      body, she threw herself back in the armchair, took up a railway novel that
      Hector had brought home, and which they had hidden from the children, and
      repaired herself with the luxury of an idle reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret and Richard likewise spent a peaceful, though pensive afternoon.
      Margaret had portions of letters from Alan to read to him, and a
      consultation to hold. The hope of her full recovery had so melted away,
      that she had, in every letter, striven to prepare Mr. Ernescliffe for the
      disappointment, and each that she received in return was so sanguine and
      affectionate, that the very fondness was as much grief as joy. She could
      not believe that he took in the true state of the case, or was prepared to
      perceive that she could never be his wife, and she wanted Richard to write
      one of his clear, dispassionate statements, such as carried full
      conviction, and to help to put a final end to the engagement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why,&rdquo; said Richard&mdash;&ldquo;why should you wish to distress him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I cannot bear that he should be deceived, and should feed on
      false hopes. Do you think it right, Richard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will write to him, if you like,&rdquo; said Richard; &ldquo;but I think he must
      pretty well know the truth from all the letters to Harry and to himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be so much better for him to settle his mind at once,&rdquo; said
      Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he would not think so&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause, while Margaret saw that her brother was thinking. At
      last he said, &ldquo;Margaret, will you pardon me? I do think that this is a
      little restlessness. The truth has not been kept from him, and I do not
      see that we are called to force it on him. He is sensible and reasonable,
      and will know how to judge when he comes home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was to try to save him the pang,&rdquo; murmured Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but it will be worse far away than near. I do not mean that we
      should conceal the fact, but you have no right to give him up before he
      comes home. The whole engagement was for the time of his voyage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you think I ought not to break it off before his return?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be pain spared&mdash;unless it should be worse by and by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not suppose we ought to look to by and by,&rdquo; said Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do the clearly right thing for the present, I mean,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;without
      anxiety for the rest. How do we&mdash;any of us&mdash;know what may be the
      case in another year?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not flatter me with hopes,&rdquo; said Margaret, sadly smiling; &ldquo;I have had
      too many of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Richard; &ldquo;I do not think you will ever get well. But so much
      may happen&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had rather have my mind made up once for all, and resign myself,&rdquo; said
      Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His will is sometimes that we should be uncertain,&rdquo; said Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that is the most trying,&rdquo; said Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so&mdash;&rdquo; and he paused tenderly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel how much has been right,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;This wedding has brought
      my real character before me. I feel what I should have been. You have no
      notion how excited and elated I can get about a little bit of dress out of
      the common way for myself or others,&rdquo; said she, smiling; &ldquo;and then all the
      external show and things belonging to station&mdash;I naturally care much
      more for them than even Flora does. Ethel would bear all those things as
      if they did not exist&mdash;I could not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They would be a temptation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They would once have been. Yes, they would now,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;And
      government, and management, and influence&mdash;you would not guess what
      dreams I used to waste on them, and now here am I set aside from it all,
      good for nothing but for all you dear ones to be kind to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They would not say so,&rdquo; said Richard kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not say it, but I feel it. Papa and Ethel are all the world to each other&mdash;Richard,
      I may say it to you. There has been only one thing more hard to bear than
      that&mdash;don&rsquo;t suppose there was a moment&rsquo;s neglect or disregard; but
      when first I understood that Ethel could be more to him than I, then I
      could not always feel rightly. It was the punishment for always wanting to
      be first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father would be grieved that you had the notion. You should not keep
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He does not know it is so,&rdquo; said Margaret; &ldquo;I am his first care, I fear,
      his second grief; but it is not in the nature of things that Ethel should
      not be more his comfort and companion. Oh! I am glad it was not she who
      married! What shall we do when she goes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This came from Margaret&rsquo;s heart, so as to show that if there had once been
      a jealous pang of mortification, it had been healed by overflowing,
      unselfish affection and humility.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went off to praise Ethel, and thence to praise Norman, and the elder
      brother and sister, who might have had some jealousy of the superiority of
      their juniors, spent a good happy hour in dwelling on the shining
      qualities they loved so heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Richard was drawn into talking of his own deeper thoughts, and
      Margaret had again the comfort of clerical counsel&mdash;and now from her
      own most dear brother! So they sat till darkness closed in, when Ethel
      came down, bringing Gertrude and her great favour, very full of chatter,
      only not quite sure whether she had been bride, bride&rsquo;s-maid, or
      bridegroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The schoolroom set, with Tom and Aubrey, came home soon after, and tongues
      went fast with stories of roast-beef, plum-pudding, and blind-man&rsquo;s-buff.
      How the dear Meta had sent a cart to Cocksmoor to bring Cherry herself,
      and how many slices everybody had eaten, and how the bride&rsquo;s health had
      been drunk by the children in real wine, and how they had all played,
      Norman and all, and how Hector had made Blanche bold enough to extract a
      raisin from the flaming snap-dragon. It was not half told when Dr. May
      came home, and Ethel went up to dress for her dinner at Abbotstoke, Mary
      following to help her and continue her narration, which bade fair to
      entertain Margaret the whole evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. May, Richard, and Ethel had a comfortable dark drive to the Grange,
      and, on arriving, found Hector deep in &lsquo;Wild Sports of the West&rsquo;, while
      Norman and Meta were sitting over the fire talking, and Mr. Rivers was
      resting in his library.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when Ethel and Meta spent the time before the gentlemen came in from
      the dining-room, in a happy tete-a-tete, Ethel learned that the fire-light
      dialogue had been the pleasantest part of the whole day, and that Meta had
      had confided to her the existence of Decius Mus&mdash;a secret which Ethel
      had hitherto considered as her own peculiar property, but she supposed it
      was a pledge of the sisterhood, which Meta professed with all the house of
      May.

      CHAPTER VIII.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     The rest all accepted the kind invitation,
     And much bustle it caused in the plumed creation;
     Such ruffling of feathers, such pruning of coats,
     Such chirping, such whistling, such clearing of throats,
     Such polishing bills, and such oiling of pinions,
     Had never been known in the biped dominions.
                                       Peacock at Home.
</pre>
    <p>
      Etheldred was thankful for that confidence to Meta Rivers, for without it,
      she would hardly have succeeded in spurring Norman up to give the
      finishing touches to Decius, and to send him in. If she talked of the poem
      as the devotion of Decius, he was willing enough, and worked with spirit,
      for he liked the ideas, and enjoyed the expressing them, and trying to
      bring his lines to his notion of perfection, but if she called it the
      &ldquo;Newdigate,&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Prize Poem,&rdquo; and declared herself sure it would be
      successful, he yawned, slackened, leaned back in his chair, and began to
      read other people&rsquo;s poetry, which Ethel was disrespectful enough not to
      think nearly as good as his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was completed at last, and Ethel stitched it up with a narrow red and
      white ribbon&mdash;the Balliol colours; and set Meta at him till a promise
      was extorted that he would send it in.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, in due time, Ethel received the following note:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Dear Ethel,&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;My peacock bubble has flown over the house.
Tell them all about it.

Your affectionate,
                                          N. W. M.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      They were too much accustomed to Norman&rsquo;s successes to be extraordinarily
      excited; Ethel would have been much mortified if the prize had been
      awarded to any one else, but, as it was, it came rather as a matter of
      course. The doctor was greatly pleased, and said he should drive round by
      Abbotstoke to tell the news there, and then laughed beyond measure to hear
      that Meta had been in the plot, saying he should accuse the little
      humming-bird of being a magpie, stealing secrets.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time the bride and bridegroom were writing that they thought of
      soon returning; they had spent the early spring at Paris, had wandered
      about in the south of France, and now were at Paris again. Flora&rsquo;s letters
      were long, descriptive, and affectionate, and she was eager to be kept
      fully informed of everything at home. As soon as she heard of Norman&rsquo;s
      success, she wrote a whole budget of letters, declaring that she and
      George would hear of no refusal; they were going to spend a fortnight at
      Oxford for the Commemoration, and must have Meta and Ethel with them to
      hear Norman&rsquo;s poem in the theatre.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. May, who already had expressed a hankering to run up for the day and
      take Ethel with him, was perfectly delighted at the proposal, and so was
      Mr. Rivers, but the young ladies made many demurs. Ethel wanted Mary to go
      in her stead, and had to be told that this would not be by any means the
      same to the other parties&mdash;she could not bear to leave Margaret; it
      was a long time since there had been letters from the Alcestis, and she
      did not like to miss being at home when they should come; and Meta, on her
      side, was so unwilling to leave her father that, at last, Dr. May scolded
      them both for a pair of conceited, self-important damsels, who thought
      nothing could go on without them; and next, compared them to young birds,
      obliged to be shoved by force into flying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meta consented first, on condition that Ethel would; and Ethel found that
      her whole house would be greatly disappointed if she refused, so she
      proceeded to be grateful, and then discovered how extremely delightful the
      plan was. Oxford, of which she had heard so much, and which she had always
      wished to see! And Norman&rsquo;s glory&mdash;and Meta&rsquo;s company&mdash;nay, the
      very holiday, and going from home, were charms enough for a girl of
      eighteen, who had never been beyond Whitford in her life. Besides, to
      crown all, papa promised that, if his patients would behave well, and not
      want him too much, he would come up for the one great day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. and Mrs. George Rivers came to Abbotstoke to collect their party. They
      arrived by a railroad, whose station was nearer to Abbotstoke than to
      Stoneborough, therefore, instead of their visiting the High Street by the
      way, Dr. May, with Ethel and Mary, were invited to dine at the Grange, the
      first evening&mdash;a proposal, at least, as new and exciting to Mary as
      was the journey to Oxford to her sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two girls went early, as the travellers had intended to arrive before
      luncheon, and, though Ethel said few words, but let Mary rattle on with a
      stream of conjectures and questions, her heart was full of longings for
      her sister, as well as of strange doubts and fears, as to the change that
      her new life might have made in her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There! there!&rdquo; cried Mary. &ldquo;Yes! it is Flora! Only she has her hair done
      in a funny way!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flora and Meta were both standing on the steps before the conservatory,
      and Mary made but one bound before she was hugging Flora. Ethel kissed her
      without so much violence, and then saw that Flora was looking very well
      and bright, more decidedly pretty and elegant than ever, and with
      certainly no diminution of affection; it was warmer, though rather more
      patronising.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How natural you look!&rdquo; was her first exclamation, as she held Mary&rsquo;s
      hand, and drew Ethel&rsquo;s arm into hers. &ldquo;And how is Margaret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty well-but the heat makes her languid&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there any letter yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not see any cause for alarm&mdash;letters are so often detained,
      but, of course, she will be anxious. Has she had pain in the back again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes, but summer always does her good&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall see her to-morrow&mdash;and the Daisy. How do you all get on?
      Have you broken down yet, Ethel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! we do go on,&rdquo; said Ethel, smiling; &ldquo;the worst thing I have done was
      expecting James to dress the salads with lamp-oil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Greenland salad! But don&rsquo;t talk of oil&mdash;I have the taste still in
      my mouth after the Pyrennean cookery! Oh! Ethel, you would have been wild
      with delight in those places!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Snowy mountains! Are they not like a fairy-dream to you now? You must
      have felt at home, as a Scotchwoman&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think of the peaks in the sunrise! Oh! I wanted you in the pass of
      Roncevalles, to hear the echo of Roland&rsquo;s horn. And we saw the cleft made
      by Roland&rsquo;s sword in the rocks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! how delightful&mdash;and Spain too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, the Isle of Pheasants, where all the conferences took place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where Louis XIV. met his bride, and Francois I. sealed his treason with
      his empty flourish&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t let us fight about Francois I. now; I want to know how Tom
      likes Eton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He gets on famously. I am so glad he is in the same house with Hector.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Ramsden&mdash;how is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No better; he has not done any duty for weeks. Tomkins and his set want
      to sell the next presentation, but papa hopes to stave that off, for there
      is a better set than usual in the Town Council this year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cocksmoor? And how are our friends the muses? I found a note from the
      secretary telling me that I am elected again. How have they behaved?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty well,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;Mrs. Ledwich has been away, so we have had few
      meetings, and have been pretty quiet, except for an uproar about the
      mistress beating that Franklin&rsquo;s girl&mdash;and what do you think I did,
      Flora? I made bold to say the woman should show her to papa, to see if she
      had done her any harm, and he found that it was all a fabrication from one
      end to the other. So it ended in the poor girl being expelled, and Mary
      and I have her twice a week, to see if there is any grace in her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To reward her!&rdquo; said Flora. &ldquo;That is always your way&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, one cannot give the poor thing quite up,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will manage the ladies at last!&rdquo; cried Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not while Mrs. Ledwich is there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll cope with her! But, come, I want you in my room&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May not I come?&rdquo; said Meta. &ldquo;I must see when&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flora held up her hand, and, while signing invitation, gave an arch look
      to Meta to be silent. Ethel here bethought herself of inquiring after Mr.
      Rivers, and then for George.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Rivers was pretty well&mdash;George, quite well, and somewhere in the
      garden; and Meta said that he had such a beard that they would hardly know
      him; while Flora added that he was delighted with the Oxford scheme.
      Flora&rsquo;s rooms had been, already, often shown to her sisters, when Mr.
      Rivers had been newly furnishing them, with every luxury and ornament that
      taste could devise. Her dressing-room, with the large bay window,
      commanding a beautiful view of Stoneborough, and filled, but not crowded,
      with every sort of choice article, was a perfect exhibition to eyes
      unaccustomed to such varieties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary could have been still amused by the hour, in studying the devices and
      ornaments on the shelves and chiffonieres; and Blanche had romanced about
      it to the little ones, till they were erecting it into a mythical palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Flora, in her simple, well-chosen dress, looked, and moved, as if she
      had been born and bred in the like.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were signs of unpacking about the room-Flora&rsquo;s dressing-case on the
      table, and some dresses lying on the sofa and ottoman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary ran up to them eagerly, and exclaimed at the beautiful shot blue and
      white silk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paris fashions?&rdquo; said Ethel carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but I don&rsquo;t parade my own dresses here,&rdquo; said Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whose are they then? Your commissions, Meta?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; and Meta laughed heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your French maid&rsquo;s then?&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;I dare say she dresses quite as
      well; and the things are too really pretty and simple for an English
      maid&rsquo;s taste.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad you like them,&rdquo; said Flora maliciously. &ldquo;Now, please to be
      good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are they for then?&rdquo; said Ethel, beginning to be frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a young lady, whose brother has got the Newdigate prize, and who is
      going to Oxford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me! Those! But I have not got four backs,&rdquo; as Ethel saw Meta in fits of
      laughing, and Flora making affirmative signs. Mary gave a ponderous spring
      of ecstasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; said Flora, &ldquo;you may as well be quiet. Whatever you may like, I am
      not going to have the Newdigate prizeman shown as brother to a scarecrow.
      I knew what you would come to, without me to take care of you. Look at
      yourself in the glass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I see no harm in myself,&rdquo; said Ethel, turning towards the
      pier-glass, and surveying herself&mdash;in a white muslin, made high, a
      black silk mantle, and a brown hat. She had felt very respectable when she
      set out, but she could not avoid a lurking conviction that, beside Flora
      and Meta, it had a scanty, schoolgirl effect. &ldquo;And,&rdquo; she continued
      quaintly, &ldquo;besides, I have really got a new gown on purpose&mdash;a good
      useful silk, that papa chose at Whitford&mdash;just the colour of a copper
      tea-kettle, where it turns purple.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ethel! you will kill me!&rdquo; said Meta, sinking back on the sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I suppose,&rdquo; continued Flora, &ldquo;that you have sent it to Miss Broad&rsquo;s,
      without any directions, and she will trim it with flame-coloured gimp, and
      glass buttons; and, unless Margaret catches you, you will find yourself
      ready to set the Thames on fire. No, my dear tea-kettle, I take you to
      Oxford on my own terms, and you had better submit, without a fuss, and be
      thankful it is no worse. George wanted me to buy you a white brocade, with
      a perfect flower-garden on it, that you could have examined with a
      microscope. I was obliged to let him buy that lace mantle, to make up to
      him. Now then, Meta, the scene opens, and discovers&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meta opened the folding-doors into Flora&rsquo;s bedroom, and thence came
      forward Bellairs and a little brisk Frenchwoman, whom Flora had acquired
      at Paris. The former, who was quite used to adorning Miss Ethel against
      her will, looked as amused as her mistresses; and, before Ethel knew what
      was going on, her muslin was stripped off her back, and that instrument of
      torture, a half made body, was being tried upon her. She made one of her
      most wonderful grimaces of despair, and stood still. The dresses were not
      so bad after all; they were more tasteful than costly, and neither in
      material nor ornament were otherwise than suitable to the occasion and the
      wearer. It was very kind and thoughtful of Flora&mdash;that she could not
      but feel&mdash;nothing had been forgotten, but when Ethel saw the mantles,
      the ribbons, the collars, the bonnet, all glistening with the French air
      of freshness and grace, she began to feel doubts and hesitations, whether
      she ought to let her sister go to such an expense on her account, and
      privately resolved that the accepting thanks should not be spoken till she
      should have consulted her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, she could only endure, be laughed at by her elders, and
      entertained by Mary&rsquo;s extreme pleasure in her array. Good Mary&mdash;it
      was more than any comedy to her; she had not one moment&rsquo;s thought of
      herself, till, when Flora dived into her box, produced a pair of
      bracelets, and fastened them on her comfortable plump arms, her eyes grew
      wide with wonder, and she felt, at least, two stages nearer womanhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora had omitted no one. There was a Paris present for every servant at
      home, and a needle-case even for Cherry Elwood, for which Ethel thanked
      her with a fervency wanting in her own case.
    </p>
    <p>
      She accomplished consulting her father on her scruples, and he set her
      mind at rest. He knew that the outlay was a mere trifle to the Riverses,
      and was greatly pleased and touched with the affection that Flora showed;
      so he only smiled at Ethel&rsquo;s doubts, and dwelt with heartfelt delight on
      the beautiful print that she had brought him, from Ary Scheffer&rsquo;s picture
      of the Great Consoler.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora was in her glory. To be able to bestow benefits on those whom she
      loved, had been always a favourite vision, and she had the full pleasure
      of feeling how much enjoyment she was causing. They had a very pleasant
      evening; she gave interesting accounts of their tour, and by her appeals
      to her husband, made him talk also. He was much more animated and
      agreeable than Ethel had ever seen him, and was actually laughing, and
      making Mary laugh heartily with his histories of the inns in the
      Pyrennees. Old Mr. Rivers looked as proud and happy as possible, and was
      quite young and gay, having evidently forgotten all his maladies, in
      paying elaborate attention to his daughter-in-law.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel told Margaret, that night, that she was quite satisfied about Flora&mdash;she
      was glad to own that she had done her injustice, and that Norman was right
      in saying there was more in George Rivers than met the eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning spent at home was equally charming. Flora came back, with love
      strengthened by absence. She was devoted to Margaret&mdash;caressing to
      all; she sat in her old places; she fulfilled her former offices; she
      gratified Miss Bracy by visiting her in the schoolroom, and talking of
      French books; and won golden opinions, by taking Gertrude in her hand, and
      walking to Minster Street to call on Mrs. Hoxton, as in old times, and
      take her the newest foreign device of working to kill time.
    </p>
    <p>
      So a few days passed merrily away, and the great journey commenced. Ethel
      met the Abbotstoke party at the station, and, with a parting injunction to
      her father, that he was to give all his patients a sleeping potion, that
      they might not miss him, she was carried away from Stoneborough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meta was in her gayest mood; Ethel full of glee and wonder, for once
      beyond Whitford, the whole world was new to her; Flora more quiet, but
      greatly enjoying their delight, and George not saying much, but smiling
      under his beard, as if well pleased to be so well amused with so little
      trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took exceeding care of them, and fed them with everything he could make
      them eat at the Swindon Station, asking for impossible things, and wishing
      them so often to change for something better, that, if they had been
      submissive, they would have had no luncheon at all; and, as it was, Flora
      was obliged to whisk into the carriage with her last sandwich in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am the more sorry,&rdquo; said he, after grumbling at the allotted ten
      minutes, &ldquo;as we shall dine so late. You desired Norman to bring any friend
      he liked, did you not, Flora?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and he spoke of bringing our old friend, Charles Cheviot, and Mr.
      Ogilvie,&rdquo; said Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Ogilvie!&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;the Master of Glenbracken! Oh! I am so glad! I
      have wanted so much to see him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! he is a great hero of yours?&rdquo; said Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know him?&rdquo; said Meta.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but he is a great friend of Norman&rsquo;s, and a Scottish cousin&mdash;Norman
      Ogilvie. Norman has his name from the Ogilvies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our grandmother, Mrs. Mackenzie, was a daughter of Lord Glenbracken,&rdquo;
       said Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This man might be called the Master of Glenbracken at home,&rdquo; said Ethel.
      &ldquo;It is such a pretty title, and there is a beautiful history belonging to
      them. There was a Master of Glenbracken who carried James IV.&lsquo;s standard
      at Flodden, and would not yield, and was killed with it wrapped round his
      body, and the Lion was dyed with his blood. Mamma knew some scraps of a
      ballad about him. Then they were out with Montrose, and had their castle
      burned by the Covenanters, and since that they have been Jacobites, and
      one barely escaped being beheaded at Carlisle! I want to hear the rights
      of it. Norman is to go, some time or other, to stay at Glenbracken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Flora, &ldquo;coming down to times present, this young heir seems
      worthy of his race. They are pattern people&mdash;have built a church, and
      have all their tenantry in excellent order. This is the only son, and very
      good and clever&mdash;he preferred going to Balliol, that he might work;
      but he is a great sportsman, George,&rdquo; added she; &ldquo;you will get on with him
      very well, about fishing, and grouse shooting, I dare say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norman met them at the station, and there was great excitement at seeing
      his long nose under his college cap. He looked rather thin and worn, but
      brightened at the sight of the party. After the question&mdash;whether
      there had been any letters from Harry? he asked whether his father were
      coming?&mdash;and Ethel thought he seemed nervous at the idea of this
      addition to his audience. He saw them to their hotel, and, promising them
      his two guests, departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel watched collegiate figures passing in the street, and recollected
      the gray buildings, just glimpsed at in her drive&mdash;it was dreamy and
      confused, and she stood musing, not discovering that it was time to dress,
      till Flora and her Frenchwoman came in, and laid violent hands on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect of their manipulations was very successful. Ethel was made to
      look well-dressed, and, still more, distinguished. Her height told well,
      when her lankiness was overcome, and her hair was disposed so as to set
      off her features to advantage. The glow of amusement and pleasure did
      still more for her; and Norman, who was in the parlour when the sisters
      appeared, quite started with surprise and satisfaction at her aspect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well done. Flora!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Why! I have been telling Ogilvie that one of
      my sisters was very plain!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, I hope we have been preparing an agreeable surprise for him,&rdquo; said
      Flora. &ldquo;Ethel is very much obliged to you. By the bye,&rdquo; she said, in her
      universal amity, &ldquo;I must ask Harvey Anderson to dinner one of these days?&rdquo;
       Norman started, and his face said &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, very well; it is as you please. I thought it would please
      Stoneborough, and that Edward was a protege of yours. What has he been
      doing? Did we not hear he had been distinguishing himself? Dr. Hoxton was
      boasting of his two scholars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask him,&rdquo; said Norman hurriedly. &ldquo;At least,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;do not let
      anything from me prevent you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he been doing anything wrong?&rdquo; reiterated Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that I know of,&rdquo; was the blunt answer; and, at the same instant, Mr.
      Ogilvie arrived. He was a pleasant, high-bred looking gentleman,
      brown-complexioned, and dark-eyed, with a brisk and resolute cast of
      countenance, that, Ethel thought, might have suited the Norman of
      Glenbracken, who died on the ruddy Lion of Scotland, and speaking with the
      very same slight degree of Scottish intonation as she remembered in her
      mother, making a most home-like sound in her ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, the rest of their own party came down, and, soon after, Charles
      Cheviot appeared, looking as quiet and tame, as he used to be in the
      schoolboy days, when Norman would bring him home, and he used to be too
      shy to speak a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, he had learned the use of his tongue by this time, though it was
      a very soft one; and he stood by Ethel, asking many questions about
      Stoneborough, while something, apparently very spirited and amusing, was
      going on between the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dinner went off well&mdash;there were few enough for the conversation
      to be general. The young men began to strike out sparks of wit against
      each other&mdash;Flora put in a word or two&mdash;Ethel grew so much
      interested in the discussion, that her face lighted up, and she joined in
      it, as if it had been only between her father and brother&mdash;keen,
      clear, and droll. After that, she had her full share in the conversation,
      and enjoyed it so much that, when she left the dinner-table, she fetched
      her writing-case to sketch the colloquy for Margaret and her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora exclaimed at her for never allowing any one to think of rest. Meta
      said she should like to do the same, but it was impossible now; she did
      not know how she should ever settle down to write a letter. Ethel was soon
      interrupted&mdash;the gentlemen entered, and Mr. Ogilvie came to the
      window, where she was sitting, and began to tell her how much obliged to
      her he and his college were, for having insisted on her brother&rsquo;s sending
      in his poem. &ldquo;Thanks are due, for our being spared an infliction next
      week,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen it?&rdquo; she asked, and she was amused by the quick negative
      movement of his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I read my friend&rsquo;s poems? But our lungs are prepared! Will you give me my
      cue&mdash;it is of no use to ask him when we are to deafen you. One
      generally knows the crack passages&mdash;something beginning with &lsquo;Oh,
      woman!&rsquo; but it is well to be in readiness&mdash;if you would only forewarn
      me of the telling hits?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they cannot tell themselves,&rdquo; said Ethel, smiling, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think they
      deserve the name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you think what does tell on the undergraduates, collectively, is
      not always what ought to tell on them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I dare say the same would not be a favourite with them and
      with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to know which are your favourites. No doubt you have a copy
      here&mdash;made by yourself;&rdquo; and he looked towards her paper-case.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was the copy, and she took it out, peering to see whether Norman
      were looking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; he said, as she paused to open the MS., &ldquo;he told me the
      thoughts were more yours than his own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he? That was not fair. One thought was an old one, long ago talked
      over between us; the rest is all his own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Mr. Ogilvie took the paper, and Ethel saw his countenance show
      evident tokens of surprise and feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said presently, &ldquo;May goes deep&mdash;deeper than most men&mdash;though
      I doubt whether they will applaud this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like it better if they did not,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;It is rather to be
      felt than shouted at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t know how the world would go on if it were felt. Few men would
      do much without the hope of fame,&rdquo; said Norman Ogilvie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it the question what they would do?&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you call fame a low motive? I see where your brother&rsquo;s philosophy
      comes from.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not call it a low motive&mdash;&rdquo; Her pause was expressive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor allow that the Non omnis moriar of Horace has in it something
      divine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a heathen&mdash;yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And pray, what would you have the moving spring?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would not that end in &lsquo;Mine be a cot, beside the rill&rsquo;?&rdquo; said he, with an
      intonation of absurd sentiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and suppose an enemy came, would duty prompt not the Hay with the
      joke&mdash;or Winkelried on the spears?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, why not&mdash;&lsquo;It is my duty to take care of Lucy.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then Lucy ought to be broken on her own wheel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all! It is Lucy&rsquo;s duty to keep her Colin from running into
      danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope there are not many Lucies who would think so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I agree with you. Most would rather have Colin killed than disgraced.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure!&rdquo; then, perceiving a knowing twinkle, as if he thought she had
      made an admission, she added, &ldquo;but what is disgrace?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some say it is misfortune,&rdquo; said Mr. Ogilvie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it not failure in duty?&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colin&rsquo;s first duty is to his king and country. If he fail in that, he is
      disgraced, in his own eyes, before Heaven and men. If he does it, there is
      a reward, which seems to me a better, more powerful motive for Lucy to set
      before him than &lsquo;My dear, I hope you will distinguish yourself,&rsquo; when the
      fact is,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                &ldquo;&lsquo;England has forty thousand men,
                   We trust, as good as he.&rsquo;
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Victory or Westminster Abbey!&rsquo; is a tolerable war-cry,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Ogilvie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so good as &lsquo;England expects every man to do his duty.&rsquo; That serves
      for those who cannot look to Westminster Abbey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you are an English woman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only by halves. I had rather have been the Master of Glenbracken at
      Flodden than King James, or&rdquo;&mdash;for she grew rather ashamed of having
      been impelled to utter the personal allusion&mdash;&ldquo;better to have been
      the Swinton or the Gordon at Homildon than all the rest put together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always thought Swinton a pig-headed old fellow, and I have little doubt
      that my ancestor was a young ruffian,&rdquo; coolly answered the Master of
      Glenbracken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; was all that Ethel could say in her indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the normal state of Scottish gentlemen,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I thought you were in earnest, I should say you did not deserve to be
      a Scot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so you wish to make me out a fause Scot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ogilvie!&rdquo; called Norman, &ldquo;are you fighting Scottish and English battles
      with Ethel there? We want you to tell us which will be the best day for
      going to Blenheim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rest of the evening was spent in arranging the programme of their
      lionising, in which it appeared that the Scottish cousin intended to take
      his full share. Ethel was not sorry, for he interested her much, while
      provoking her. She was obliged to put out her full strength in answering
      him, and felt, at the same time, that he was not making any effort in
      using the arguments that puzzled her&mdash;she was in earnest, while he
      was at play; and, though there was something teasing in this, and she knew
      it partook of what her brothers called chaffing, it gave her that sense of
      power on his side, which is always attractive to women. With the knowledge
      that, through Norman, she had of his real character, she understood that
      half, at least, of what he said was jest; and the other half was enough in
      earnest to make it exciting to argue with him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     While I, thy dearest, sat apart,
     And felt thy triumphs were as mine,
     And lov&rsquo;d them more than they were thine.
                                            TENNYSON.
</pre>
    <p>
      That was a week of weeks; the most memorable week in Ethel&rsquo;s life, spent
      in indefatigable sight-seeing. College Chapels, Bodleian Library, Taylor
      Gallery, the Museum, all were thoroughly studied, and, if Flora had not
      dragged the party on, in mercy to poor George&rsquo;s patience, Ethel would
      never have got through a day&rsquo;s work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, Mr. Ogilvie, when annoyed at being hurried in going over Merton
      Chapel with her, was heard to whisper that he acted the part of policeman,
      by a perpetual &ldquo;move on&rdquo;; and as Ethel recollected the portly form and
      wooden face of the superintendent at Stoneborough, she was afraid that the
      comparison would not soon be forgotten. Norman Ogilvie seemed to consider
      himself bound to their train as much as his namesake, or, as on the second
      morning, Norman reported his reasoning, it was that a man must walk about
      with somebody on Commemoration week, and that it was a comfort to do so
      with ladies who wore their bonnets upon their heads, instead of, like most
      of those he met, remind him of what Cock Robin said to Jenny Wren in that
      matrimonial quarrel, when
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
             Robin, he grew angry,
             Hopped upon a twig&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      Flora was extremely delighted, and, in matronly fashion, told her sister
      that people were always respected and admired who had the strength of mind
      to resist unsuitable customs. Ethel laughed in answer, and said she
      thought it would take a great deal more strength of mind to go about with
      her whole visage exposed to the universal gaze; and, woman-like, they had
      a thorough gossip over the evils of the &ldquo;backsliding&rdquo; head-gear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norman had retreated from it into the window, when Flora returned to the
      charge about Harvey Anderson. She had been questioning their old friend
      Mr. Everard, and had learned from him that the cause of the hesitation
      with which his name had been received was that he had become imbued with
      some of the Rationalistic ideas current in some quarters. He seldom met
      Norman May without forcing on him debates, which were subjects of great
      interest to the hearers, as the two young men were considered as the most
      distinguished representatives of their respective causes, among their own
      immediate contemporaries. Norman&rsquo;s powers of argument, his eloquence,
      readiness, and clearness, were thought to rank very high, and, in the
      opinion of Mr. Everard, had been of great effect in preventing other
      youths from being carried away by the specious brilliancy of his rival.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel valued this testimony far above the Newdigate prize, and she was
      extremely surprised by hearing Flora declare her intention of still asking
      Mr. Anderson to dinner, only consulting her brother as to the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Flora! ask him! Norman&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norman had turned away with the simple answer, &ldquo;any day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Norman is wiser than you are, Ethel,&rdquo; said Flora. &ldquo;He knows that
      Stoneborough would be up in arms at any neglect from us to one of the
      Andersons, and, considering the rivalship, it is the more graceful, and
      becoming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not think it right,&rdquo; said Ethel stoutly; &ldquo;I believe that a line
      ought to be drawn, and that we ought not to associate with people who
      openly tamper with their faith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never fear,&rdquo; smiled Flora; &ldquo;I promise you that there shall be no debates
      at my table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel felt the force of the pronoun, and, as Flora walked out of the room,
      she went up to Norman, who had been resting his brow against the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is vain to argue with her,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but, Norman, do not you think
      it is clearly wrong to seek after men who desert and deny&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped short, frightened at his pale look.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke in a low clear tone that seemed to thrill her with a sort of
      alarm. &ldquo;If the secrets of men&rsquo;s hearts were probed, who could cast the
      first stone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to cast stones,&rdquo; she began; but he made a gesture as if he
      would not hear, and, at the same moment, Mr. Ogilvie entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had Ethel been at home, she would have pondered much over her brother&rsquo;s
      meaning&mdash;here she had no leisure. Not only was she fully occupied
      with the new scenes around her, but her Scottish cousin took up every
      moment open to conversation. He was older than Norman, and had just taken
      his degree, and he talked with that superior aplomb, which a few years
      bestow at their time of life, without conceit, but more hopeful and
      ambitious, and with higher spirits than his cousin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though industrious and distinguished, he had not avoided society or
      amusement, was a great cricketer and tennis-player, one of the &ldquo;eight&rdquo;
       whose success in the boat races was one of Norman&rsquo;s prime interests, and
      he told stories of frolics that reminded Ethel of her father&rsquo;s old
      Cambridge adventures.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a new variety in her eyes, and entertained her greatly. Where the
      bounds of banter ended, was not easy to define, but whenever he tried a
      little mystification, she either entered merrily into the humour, or threw
      it over with keen wit that he kept constantly on the stretch. They were
      always discovering odd, unexpected bits of knowledge in each other, and a
      great deal more accordance in views and opinions than appeared on the
      surface, for his enthusiasm usually veiled itself in persiflage on hers,
      though he was too good and serious to carry it too far.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Blenheim, perhaps he thought he had given an overdose of nonsense, and
      made her believe, as Meta really did, that the Duchess Sarah was his model
      woman; for as they walked in the park in search of Phoebe Mayflower&rsquo;s
      well, he gathered a fern leaf, to show her the Glenbracken badge, and
      talked to her of his home, his mother, and his sister Marjorie, and the
      little church in the rocky glen. He gave the history of the stolen
      meetings of the little knot of churchmen during the days of persecution,
      and showed a heart descended straight from the Ogilvie who was &ldquo;out with
      Montrose,&rdquo; now that the upper structure of young England was for a little
      while put aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this, she took his jokes much more coolly, and made thrusts beneath
      them, which he seemed to enjoy, and caused him to unfold himself the more.
      She liked him all the better for finding that he thought Norman had been a
      very good friend to him, and that he admired her brother heartily,
      watching tenderly over his tendencies to make himself unhappy. He confided
      to her that, much as he rejoiced in the defeats of Anderson, he feared
      that the reading and thought consequent on the discussions, had helped to
      overstrain Norman&rsquo;s mind, and he was very anxious to carry him away from
      all study, and toil, and make his brains rest, and his eyes delight
      themselves upon Scottish mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon came vivid descriptions of the scenery, especially his own glen
      with the ruined tower, and ardent wishes that his cousin Ethel could see
      them also, and know Marjorie. She could quite echo the wish, Edinburgh and
      Loch Katrine had been the visions of her life, and now that she had once
      taken the leap and left home, absence did not seem impossible, and, with a
      start of delight, she hailed her own conviction that he intended his
      mother to invite the party to Glenbracken.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Norman&rsquo;s visit, Mr. Ogilvie declared that he must come home with him
      and pay his long-promised visit to Stoneborough. He should have come long
      ago. He had been coming last winter, but the wedding had prevented him; he
      had always wished to know Dr. May, whom his father well remembered, and
      now nothing should keep him away!
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora looked on amused and pleased at Ethel&rsquo;s development&mdash;her
      abruptness softened into piquancy, and her countenance so embellished,
      that the irregularity only added to the expressiveness. There was no
      saying what Ethel would come to! She had not said that she would not go to
      the intended ball, and her grimaces at the mention of it were growing
      fainter every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The discussion about Harvey Anderson was never revived; Flora sent the
      invitation without another word&mdash;he came with half a dozen other
      gentlemen&mdash;Ethel made him a civil greeting, but her head was full of
      boats and the procession day, about which Mr. Ogilvie was telling her, and
      she thought of him no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lucky step!&rdquo; thought Flora. &ldquo;A grand thing for Ethel&mdash;a capital
      connection for us all. Lady Glenbracken will not come too much into my
      sphere either. Yes, I am doing well by my sisters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It would make stay-at-home people giddy to record how much pleasure, how
      much conversation and laughter were crowded into those ten days, and with
      much thought and feeling beside them, for these were not girls on whom
      grave Oxford could leave no impression but one of gaiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole party was very full of merriment. Norman May, especially, on
      whom Flora contrived to devolve that real leadership of conversation that
      should rightly have belonged to George Rivers, kept up the ball with wit
      and drollery far beyond what he usually put forth; enlivened George into
      being almost an agreeable man, and drew out little Meta&rsquo;s vivacity into
      sunny sparkles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meta generally had Norman for her share, and seemed highly contented with
      his lionisings, which were given much more quietly and copiously than
      those which his cousin bestowed upon his sister. Or if there were anything
      enterprising to be done, any tower to be mounted, or anything with the
      smallest spice of danger in it, Meta was charmed, and with her lightness
      and airiness of foot and figure, and perfectly feminine ways, showed a
      spirit of adventure that added to the general diversion. But if she were
      to be helped up or down anywhere, she certainly seemed to find greater
      security in Norman May&rsquo;s assistance, though it was but a feather-like
      touch that she ever used to aid her bounding step.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both as being diffident, and, in a manner at home, Norman was not as
      constantly her cavalier as was Mr. Ogilvie to his sister; and, when
      supplanted, his wont was either to pioneer for Flora, or, if she did not
      need him, to walk alone, grave and abstracted. There was a weight on his
      brow, when nothing was going on to drive it away, and whether it were
      nervousness as to the performance in store for him, anxiety about Harry,
      or, as Mr. Ogilvie said, too severe application; some burden hung upon
      him, that was only lightened for the time by his participation in the
      enjoyment of the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Sunday evening, when they had been entering into the almost vision-like
      delight of the choicest of music, and other accompaniments of church
      service, they went to walk in Christchurch Meadows. They had begun
      altogether by comparing feelings&mdash;Ethel wondering whether
      Stoneborough Minster would ever be used as it might be, and whether, if
      so, they should be practically the better for it; and proceeding with
      metaphysics on her side, and satire on Norman Ogilvie&rsquo;s, to speculate
      whether that which is, is best, and the rights and wrongs of striving for
      change and improvements, what should begin from above, and what from
      beneath&mdash;with illustrations often laughter-moving, though they were
      much in earnest, as the young heir of Glenbracken looked into his future
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora had diverged into wondering who would have the living after poor old
      Mr. Ramsden, and walked, keeping her husband amused with instances of his
      blunders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meta, as with Norman she parted from the rest, thought her own dear
      Abbotstoke church, and Mr Charles Wilmot, great subjects for content and
      thanksgiving, though it was a wonderful treat to see and hear such as she
      had enjoyed to-day; and she thought it was a joy, to carry away abidingly,
      to know that praise and worship, as near perfection as this earth could
      render them, were being offered up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norman understood her thought, but responded by more of a sigh than was
      quite comfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meta went on with her own thoughts, on the connection between worship and
      good works, how the one leads to the other, and how praise with pure lips
      is, after all, the great purpose of existence.&mdash;Her last thought she
      spoke aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose everything, our own happiness and all, are given to us to turn
      into praise,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;&rdquo; echoed Norman; but as if his thoughts were not quite with
      hers, or rather in another part of the same subject; then recalling
      himself, &ldquo;Happy such as can do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If one only could&mdash;&rdquo; said Meta.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&mdash;don&rsquo;t say otherwise,&rdquo; exclaimed Norman; &ldquo;I know, at least,
      that you and my father can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. May does so, more than any one I know,&rdquo; said Meta.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Norman again; &ldquo;it is his secret of joy. To him, it is never, &lsquo;I
      am half sick of shadows&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To him they are not shadows, but foretastes,&rdquo; said Meta. Silence again;
      and when she spoke, she said, &ldquo;I have always thought it must be such a
      happiness to have power of any kind that can be used in direct service, or
      actual doing good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Norman. &ldquo;Whatever becomes a profession, becomes an unreality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely not, in becoming a duty,&rdquo; said Meta.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for all,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;but where the fabric erected by ourselves, in
      the sight of the world, is but an outer case, a shell of mere words, blown
      up for the occasion, strung together as mere language; then,
      self-convicted, we shrink within the husk, and feel our own worthlessness
      and hypocrisy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As one feels in reproving the school children for behaving ill at
      church?&rdquo; said Meta.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never felt anything approaching to it!&rdquo; said Norman. &ldquo;To know oneself
      to be such a deception, that everything else seems a delusion too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether that is metaphysical,&rdquo; said Meta, &ldquo;but I am sure I
      don&rsquo;t understand it. One must know oneself to be worse than one knows any
      one else to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not wish you to understand,&rdquo; said Norman; and yet he seemed
      impelled to go on; for, after a hesitating silence, he added, &ldquo;When the
      wanderer in the desert fears that the spring is but a mirage; or when all
      that is held dear is made hazy or distorted by some enchanter, what do you
      think are the feelings, Meta?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be dreadful,&rdquo; she said, rather bewildered; &ldquo;but he may know it is
      a delusion, if he can but wake. Has he not always a spell, a charm?&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the spell?&rdquo; eagerly said Norman, standing still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe&mdash;&rdquo; said Meta, hardly knowing how she came to choose the
      words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe!&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;What&mdash;when we go beyond the province of
      reason&mdash;human, a thing of sense after all! How often have I so
      answered. But Meta, when a man has been drawn, in self-sufficient
      security, to look into a magic mirror, and cannot detach his eyes from the
      confused, misty scene&mdash;where all that had his allegiance appears
      shattered, overthrown, like a broken image, or at least unable to endure
      examination, then&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Norman, is that the trial to any one here? I thought old Oxford was
      the great guardian nurse of truth! I am sure she cannot deal in magic
      mirrors or such frightful things. Do you know you are talking like a very
      horrible dream?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe I am in one,&rdquo; said Norman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure you are. Wake!&rdquo; said Meta, looking up, smiling in his face.
      &ldquo;You have read yourself into a maze, that&rsquo;s all&mdash;what Mary calls,
      muzzling your head; you don&rsquo;t really think all this, and when you get into
      the country, away from books, you will forget it. One look at our dear old
      purple Welsh hills will blow away all the mists!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ought not to have spoken in this manner,&rdquo; said Norman sadly. &ldquo;Forget
      it, Meta.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forget it! Of course I will. It is all nonsense, and meant to be
      forgotten,&rdquo; said Meta, laughing. &ldquo;You will own that it is by-and-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave a deep sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think I am unfeeling,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but I know it is all a fog up
      from books, books, books&mdash;I should like to drive it off with a good
      fresh gust of wind! Oh! I wish those yellow lilies would grow in our
      river!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meta talked away gaily for the rest of the walk. She was anything but
      unfeeling, but she had a confidence in Norman that forbade her to see
      anything here but one of his variations of spirits, which always sank in
      the hour of triumph. She put forth her brightness to enliven him, and, in
      their subsequent tete-a-tetes, she avoided all that could lead to a
      renewal of this conversation. Ethel would not have rested till it had been
      fought out. Meta thought it so imaginary, that it had better die for want
      of the aliment of words; certainly, hers could not reach an intellect like
      his, and she would only soothe and amuse him. Dr. May, mind-curer as well
      as body-curer, would soon be here, to put the climax to the general joy
      and watch his own son.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did arrive; quite prepared to enjoy, giving an excellent account of
      both homes; Mr. Rivers very well, and the Wilmots taking care of him, and
      Margaret as comfortable as usual, Mary making a most important and capable
      little housekeeper, Miss Bracy as good as possible. He talked as if they
      had all flourished the better for Ethel&rsquo;s absence, but he had evidently
      missed her greatly, as he showed, without knowing it, by his instant
      eagerness to have her to himself. Even Norman, prizeman as he was, was
      less wanted. There was proud affection, eager congratulation, for him, but
      it was Ethel to whom he wanted to tell everything that had passed during
      her absence&mdash;whom he treated as if they were meeting after a tedious
      separation.
    </p>
    <p>
      They dined rather early, and went out afterwards, to walk down the High
      Street to Christchurch Meadow. Norman and Ethel had been anxious for this;
      they thought it would give their father the best idea of the tout ensemble
      of Oxford, and were not without hopes of beating him by his own
      confession, in that standing fight between him and his sons, as to the
      beauties of Oxford and Cambridge&mdash;a fight in which, hitherto, they
      had been equally matched&mdash;neither partisan having seen the rival
      University.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora stayed at home; she owned herself fairly tired by her arduous duties
      of following the two young ladies about, and was very glad to give her
      father the keeping of them. Dr. May held out his arm to Ethel&mdash;Norman
      secured his peculiar property. Ethel could have preferred that it should
      be otherwise&mdash;Norman would have no companion but George Rivers; how
      bored he would be!
    </p>
    <p>
      All through the streets, while she was telling her father the names of the
      buildings, she was not giving her whole attention; she was trying to
      guess, from the sounds behind, whether Mr. Ogilvie were accompanying them.
      They entered the meadows&mdash;Norman turned round, with a laugh, to defy
      the doctor to talk of the Cam, on the banks of the Isis. The party stood
      still&mdash;the other two gentlemen came up. They amalgamated again&mdash;all
      the Oxonians conspiring to say spiteful things of the Cam, and Dr. May
      making a spirited defence, in which Ethel found herself impelled to join.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the wide gravelled path, they proceeded in threes; George attached
      himself to his sister and Norman. Mr. Ogilvie came to Ethel&rsquo;s other side,
      and began to point out all the various notabilities. Ethel was happy
      again; her father was so much pleased and amused, with him, and he with
      her father, that it was a treat to look on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Dr. May, as usual, always meeting with acquaintances, fell in
      with a county neighbour, and Ethel had another pleasant aside, until her
      father claimed her, and Mr. Ogilvie was absorbed among another party, and
      lost to her sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came to tea, but, by that time, Dr. May had established himself in the
      chair which had hitherto been appropriated to her cousin, a chair that cut
      her nook off from the rest of the world, and made her the exclusive
      possession of the occupant. There was a most interesting history for her
      to hear, of a meeting with the Town Council, which she had left pending,
      when Dr. May had been battling to save the next presentation of the living
      from being sold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few subjects could affect Ethel more nearly, yet she caught herself
      missing the thread of his discourse, in trying to hear what Mr. Ogilvie
      was saying to Flora about a visit to Glenbracken.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time came for the two Balliol men to take their leave. Norman May had
      been sitting very silent all the evening, and Meta, who was near him,
      respected his mood. When he said good-night, he drew Ethel outside the
      door. &ldquo;Ethel,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;only one thing: do ask my father not to put on
      his spectacles to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Ethel, half smiling; &ldquo;Richard did not mind them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard has more humility&mdash;I shall break down if he looks at me! I
      wish you were all at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other Norman came out of the sitting-room at the moment, and heard the
      last words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said he to Ethel, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take care of him. He shall comport
      himself as if you were all at Nova Zembla. A pretty fellow to talk of
      despising fame, and then get a fit of stage-fright!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, good-night,&rdquo; said Norman, sighing. &ldquo;It will be over to-morrow; only
      remember the spectacles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. May laughed a good deal at the request, and asked if the rest of the
      party were to be blindfolded. Meta wondered that Ethel should have
      mentioned the request so publicly; she was a good deal touched by it, and
      she thought Dr. May ought to be so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Good-night was said, and Dr. May put his arm round Ethel, and gave her the
      kiss that she had missed for seven nights. It was very homelike, and it
      brought a sudden flash of thought across Ethel! What had she been doing?
      She had been impatient of her father&rsquo;s monopoly of her!
    </p>
    <p>
      She parted with Flora, and entered the room she shared with Meta, where
      Bellairs waited to attend her little mistress. Few words passed between
      the two girls, and those chiefly on the morrow&rsquo;s dress. Meta had some
      fixed ideas&mdash;she should wear pink. Norman had said he liked her pink
      bonnet, and then she could put down her white veil, so that he could be
      certain that she was not looking; Ethel vaguely believed Flora meant to
      wear&mdash;something&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Bellairs went away, and Meta gave expression to her eager hope that Norman
      would go through it well. If he would only read it as he did last Easter
      to her and Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;This nervousness always wears off when it comes to
      the point, and he warms with his subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! but think of all the eyes looking at him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our&rsquo;s are all that he really cares for, and he will think of none of
      them, when he begins. No, Meta, you must not encourage him in it. Papa
      says, if he did not think it half morbid&mdash;the result of the shock to
      his nerves&mdash;he should be angry with it as a sort of conceit!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have thought that the last thing to be said of Norman!&rdquo; said
      Meta, with a little suppressed indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was once in his nature,&rdquo; said Ethel; &ldquo;and I think it is the fault he
      most beats down. There was a time, before you knew him, when he would have
      been vain and ambitious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it is as they say, conquered faults grow to be the opposite
      virtues!&rdquo; said Meta. &ldquo;How very good he is, Ethel; one sees it more when he
      is with other people, and one hears all these young men&rsquo;s stories!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything Norman does not do, is not therefore wrong,&rdquo; said Ethel, with
      her usual lucidity of expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you like him the better for keeping out of all these follies?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Norman does not call them so, I am sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he is too good to condemn&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not only that,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;I know papa thinks that the first
      grief, coming at his age, and in the manner it did, checked and subdued
      his spirits, so that he has little pleasure in those things. And he always
      meant to be a clergyman, which acted as a sort of consecration on him; but
      many things are innocent; and I do believe papa would like it better, if
      Norman were less grave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Meta, remembering the Sunday talk, &ldquo;but still, he would not be
      all he is&mdash;so different from others&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, I don&rsquo;t mean less good, only, less grave,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;and
      certainly less nervous. But, perhaps, it is a good thing; dear mamma
      thought his talents would have been a greater temptation than they seem to
      be, subdued as he has been. I only meant that you must not condemn all
      that Norman does not do. Now, goodnight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Very different were the feelings with which those two young girls
      stretched themselves in their beds that night. Margaret Rivers&rsquo;s innocent,
      happy little heart was taken up in one contemplation. Admiration,
      sympathy, and the exultation for him, which he would not feel for himself,
      drew little Meta entirely out of herself&mdash;a self that never held her
      much. She was proud of the slender thread of connection between them; she
      was confident that his vague fancies were but the scruples of a sensitive
      mind, and, as she fell sound asleep, she murmured broken lines of Decius,
      mixed with promises not to look.
    </p>
    <p>
      Etheldred heard them, for there was no sleep for her. She had a parley to
      hold with herself, and to accuse her own feelings of having been unkind,
      ungrateful, undutiful towards her father. What had a fit of vanity brought
      her to? that she should have been teased by what would naturally have been
      her greatest delight! her father&rsquo;s pleasure in being with her. Was this
      the girl who had lately vowed within herself that her father should be her
      first earthly object?
    </p>
    <p>
      At first, Ethel blamed herself for her secret impatience, but another
      conviction crossed her, and not an unpleasing one, though it made her
      cheeks tingle with maidenly shame, at having called it up. Throughout this
      week, Norman Ogilvie had certainly sought her out. He had looked
      disappointed this evening&mdash;there was no doubt that he was attracted
      by her&mdash;by her, plain, awkward Ethel! Such a perception assuredly
      never gave so much pleasure to a beauty as it did to Ethel, who had always
      believed herself far less good-looking than she really was. It was a gleam
      of delight, and, though she set herself to scold it down, the conviction
      was elastic, and always leaped up again.
    </p>
    <p>
      That resolution came before her, but it had been unspoken; it could not be
      binding, and, if her notion were really right, the misty brilliant future
      of mutual joy dazzled her! But there was another side: her father
      oppressed and lonely, Margaret ill and pining, Mary, neither companion nor
      authority, the children running wild; and she, who had mentally vowed
      never to forsake her father, far away, enjoying her own happiness. &ldquo;Ah!
      that resolve had seemed easy enough when it was made, when,&rdquo; thought
      Ethel, &ldquo;I fancied no one could care for me! Shame on me! Now is the time
      to test it! I must go home with papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a great struggle&mdash;on one side there was the deceitful guise of
      modesty, telling her it was absurd to give so much importance to the
      kindness of the first cousin with whom she had ever been thrown; there was
      the dislike to vex Flora to make a discussion, and break up the party.
      There was the desire to hear the concert, to go to the breakfast at
      &mdash;&mdash; College, to return round by Warwick Castle, and Kenilworth,
      as designed. Should she lose all this for a mere flattering fancy? She,
      who had laughed at Miss Boulder, for imagining every one who spoke to her
      was smitten. What reason could she assign? It would be simply ridiculous,
      and unkind&mdash;and it was so very pleasant. Mr. Ogilvie would be too
      wise to think of so incongruous a connection, which would be so sure to
      displease his parents. It was more absurd than ever to think of it. The
      heir of Glenbracken, and a country physician&rsquo;s daughter!
    </p>
    <p>
      That was a candid heart which owned that its own repugnance to accept this
      disparity as an objection, was an additional evidence that she ought to
      flee from further intercourse. She believed that no harm was done yet; she
      was sure that she loved her father better than anything else in the world,
      and whilst she did so, it was best to preserve her heart for him. Widowed
      as he was, she knew that he would sorely miss her, and that for years to
      come, she should be necessary at home. She had better come away while it
      would cost only a slight pang, for that it was pain to leave Norman
      Ogilvie, was symptom enough of the need of not letting her own silly heart
      go further. However it might be with him, another week would only make it
      worse with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go home with papa!&rdquo; was the ultimatum reached by each chain of
      mental reasonings, and borne in after each short prayer for guidance, as
      Ethel tossed about listening to the perpetual striking of all the Oxford
      clocks, until daylight had begun to shine in; when she fell asleep, and
      was only waked by Meta, standing over her with a sponge, looking very
      mischievous, as she reminded her of their appointment with Dr. May, to go
      to the early service in New College Chapel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The world looked different that morning with Ethel, but the determination
      was fixed, and the service strengthened it. She was so silent during the
      walk, that her companions rallied her, and they both supposed she was
      anxious about Norman; but taking her opportunity, when Meta was gone to
      prepare for breakfast, she rushed, in her usual way, into the subject.
      &ldquo;Papa! if you please, I should like to go home to-morrow with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; said the doctor, amazed. &ldquo;How is this? I told you that Miss Bracy
      and Mary are doing famously.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but I had rather go back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; and Dr. May looked at the door, and spoke low. &ldquo;They make you
      welcome, I hope&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! nothing can be kinder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad to hear it. This Rivers is such a lout, that I could not tell
      how it might be. I did not look to see you turn homesick all at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel smiled. &ldquo;Yes, I have been very happy; but please, papa, ask no
      questions&mdash;only take me home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come! it is all a homesick fit, Ethel&mdash;never fear the ball. Think of
      the concert. If it were not for that poor baby of Mrs. Larkins, I should
      stay myself to hear Sonntag again. You won&rsquo;t have such another chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, but I think I ought to go&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      George came in, and they could say no more. Both were silent on the
      subject at breakfast, but when afterwards Flora seized on Ethel, to array
      her for the theatre, she was able to say, &ldquo;Flora, please don&rsquo;t be angry
      with me&mdash;you have been very kind to me, but I mean to go home with
      papa to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I declare!&rdquo; said Flora composedly, &ldquo;you are as bad as the children at the
      infant school, crying to go home the instant they see their mothers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Flora, but I must go. Thank you for all this pleasure, but I shall
      have heard Norman&rsquo;s poem, and then I must go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flora turned her round, looked in her face kindly, kissed her, and said,
      &ldquo;My dear, never mind, it will all come right again&mdash;only, don&rsquo;t run
      away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will come right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any little misunderstanding with Norman Ogilvie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean,&rdquo; said Ethel, becoming scarlet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, you need not try to hide it. I see that you have got into a
      fright. You have made a discovery, but that is no reason for running
      away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes it is!&rdquo; said Ethel firmly, not denying the charge, though reddening
      more than ever at finding her impression confirmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor child! she is afraid!&rdquo; said Flora tenderly; &ldquo;but I will take care of
      you, Ethel. It is everything delightful. You are the very girl for such a
      heros de Roman, and it has embellished you more than all my Paris
      fineries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, Flora! We ought not to talk in this way, as if&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As if he had done more than walk with, and talk with, nobody else! How he
      did hate papa last night. I had a great mind to call papa off, in pity to
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Flora. If there were anything in it, it would not be proper to
      think of it, so I am going home to prevent it.&rdquo; The words were spoken with
      averted face and heaving breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Proper?&rdquo; said Flora. &ldquo;The Mays are a good old family, and our own
      grandmother was an honourable Ogilvie herself. A Scottish baron, very poor
      too, has no right to look down&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They shall not look down. Flora, it is of no use to talk. I cannot be
      spared from home, and I will not put myself in the way of being tempted to
      forsake them all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tempted!&rdquo; said Flora, laughing. &ldquo;Is it such a wicked thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in others, but it would be wrong in me, with such a state of things
      as there is at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not suppose he would want you for some years to come. He is only
      two-and-twenty. Mary will grow older.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Margaret will either be married, or want constant care. Flora, I will not
      let myself be drawn from them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may think so now; but it would be for their real good to relieve papa
      of any of us. If we were all to think as you do, how should we live? I
      don&rsquo;t know&mdash;for papa told me there will be barely ten thousand
      pounds, besides the houses, and what will that be among ten? I am not
      talking of yourself, but think of the others!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know papa will not be happy without me, and I will not leave him,&rdquo;
       repeated Ethel, not answering the argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora changed her ground, and laughed. &ldquo;We are getting into the heroics,&rdquo;
       she said, &ldquo;when it would be very foolish to break up our plans, only
      because we have found a pleasant cousin. There is nothing serious in it, I
      dare say. How silly of us to argue on such an idea!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meta came in before Flora could say more, but Ethel, with burning cheeks,
      repeated, &ldquo;It will be safer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel had, meantime, been dressed by her sister; and, as Bellairs came to
      adorn Meta, and she could have no solitude, she went downstairs, thinking
      she heard Norman&rsquo;s step, and hoping to judge of his mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      She entered the room with an exclamation, &ldquo;Oh, Norman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At your service!&rdquo; said the wrong Norman, looking merrily up from behind a
      newspaper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I beg your pardon; I thought&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your thoughts were quite right,&rdquo; he said, smiling. &ldquo;Your brother desires
      me to present his respects to his honoured family, and to inform them that
      his stock of assurance is likely to be diminished by the pleasure of their
      company this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is he?&rdquo; asked Ethel anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty fair. He has blue saucers round his eyes, as he had before he went
      up for his little go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know them,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very odd,&rdquo; continued her cousin; &ldquo;when the end always is, that he says he
      has the luck of being set on in the very place he knows best. But I think
      it has expended itself in a sleepless night, and I have no fears, when he
      comes to the point.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is he doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Writing to his brother Harry. He said it was the day for the Pacific
      mail, and that Harry&rsquo;s pleasure would be the best of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Ethel, glancing towards the paper, &ldquo;is there any naval
      intelligence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked; and while she was thinking whether she ought not to depart, he
      exclaimed, in a tone that startled her, &ldquo;Ha! No. Is your brother&rsquo;s ship
      the Alcestis?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! Oh, what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing then, I assure you. See, it is merely this&mdash;she has not come
      into Sydney so soon as expected, which you knew before. That is all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; said the trembling Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was no more than an echo of their unconfessed apprehensions, yet it
      seemed to give them a body; and Ethel&rsquo;s thoughts flew to Margaret. Her
      going home would be absolutely necessary now. Mr. Ogilvie kindly began to
      talk away her alarm, saying that there was still no reason for dread,
      mentioning the many causes that might have delayed the ship, and
      reassuring her greatly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Norman!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! true. Poor May! He will break down to a certainty if he hears it. I
      will go at once, and keep guard over him, lest he should meet with this
      paper. But pray, don&rsquo;t be alarmed. I assure you there is no cause. You
      will have letters to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel would fain have thrown off her finery and hurried home at once, but
      no one regarded the matter as she did. Dr. May agreed with Flora that it
      was no worse than before, and though they now thought Ethel&rsquo;s return
      desirable, on Margaret&rsquo;s account, it would be better not to add to the
      shock by a sudden arrival, especially as they took in no daily paper at
      home. So the theatre was not to be given up, nor any of the subsequent
      plans, except so far as regarded Ethel; and, this agreed, they started for
      the scene of action.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were hardly in the street before they met the ubiquitous Mr. Ogilvie,
      saying that Cheviot, Norman&rsquo;s prompter, was aware of the report, and was
      guarding him, while he came to escort the ladies, through what he
      expressively called &ldquo;the bear fight.&rdquo; Ethel resolutely adhered to her
      father, and her cousin took care of Meta, who had been clinging in a
      tiptoe manner to the point of her brother&rsquo;s high elbow, looking as if the
      crowd might easily brush off such a little fly, without his missing her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inch by inch, a step at a time, the ladies were landed in a crowd of their
      own sex, where Flora bravely pioneered; they emerged on their benches,
      shook themselves out, and seated themselves. There was the swarm of gay
      ladies around them, and beneath the area, fast being paved with heads,
      black, brown, gray, and bald, a surging living sea, where Meta soon
      pointed out Dr. May and George; the mere sight of such masses of people
      was curious and interesting, reminding Ethel of Cherry Elwood having once
      shocked her by saying the Whit-Monday club was the most beautiful sight in
      the whole year. And above! that gallery of trampling undergraduates, and
      more than trampling! Ethel and Meta could, at first, have found it in
      their hearts to be frightened at those thundering shouts, but the young
      ladies were usually of opinions so similar, that the louder grew the
      cheers, the more they laughed and exulted, so carried along that no cares
      could be remembered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Making a way through the thronged area, behold the procession of scarlet
      doctors, advancing through the midst, till the red and black
      vice-chancellor sat enthroned in the centre, and the scarlet line became a
      semicircle, dividing the flower-garden of ladies from the black mass
      below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the introduction of the honorary doctors, one by one, with the
      Latin speech, which Ethel&rsquo;s companions unreasonably required her to
      translate to them, while she was using all her ears to catch a word or
      two, and her eyes to glimpse at the features of men of note.
    </p>
    <p>
      By-and-by a youth made his appearance in the rostrum, and a good deal of
      Latin ensued, of which Flora hoped Ethel was less tired than she was. In
      time, however, Meta saw the spectacles removed, and George looking
      straight up, and she drew down her veil, and took hold of Flora&rsquo;s hand,
      and Ethel flushed like a hot coal. Nevertheless, all contrived to see a
      tall figure, with face much flushed, and hands moving nervously. The world
      was tired, and people were departing, so that the first lines were lost,
      perhaps a satisfaction to Norman; but his voice soon cleared and became
      louder, his eyes lighted, and Ethel knew the &ldquo;funny state&rdquo; had come to his
      relief&mdash;people&rsquo;s attention was arrested&mdash;there was no more going
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was well that Norman was ignorant of the fears for Harry, for four
      lines had been added since Ethel had seen the poem, saying how
      self-sacrifice sent forth the sailor-boy from home, to the lone watch, the
      wave and storm, his spirit rising high, ere manhood braced his form.
    </p>
    <p>
      Applause did not come where Ethel had expected it, and, at first, there
      was silence at the close, but suddenly the acclamations rose with
      deafening loudness, though hardly what greets some poems with more to
      catch the popular ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel&rsquo;s great excitement was over, and presently she found herself outside
      of the theatre, a shower falling, and an umbrella held over her by Mr.
      Ogilvie, who was asking her if it was not admirable, and declaring the
      poem might rank with Heber&rsquo;s &lsquo;Palestine&rsquo;, or Milman&rsquo;s &lsquo;Apollo&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were bound for a great luncheon at one of the colleges, where Ethel
      might survey the Principal with whom Miss Rich had corresponded. Mr.
      Ogilvie sat next to her, told her all the names, and quizzed the
      dignitaries, but she had a sense of depression, and did not wish to enter
      into the usual strain of banter. He dropped his lively tone, and drew her
      out about Harry, till she was telling eagerly of her dear sailor brother,
      and found him so sympathising and considerate, that she did not like him
      less; though she felt her intercourse with him a sort of intoxication,
      that would only make it the worse for her by-and-by.
    </p>
    <p>
      During that whole luncheon, and their walk through the gardens, where
      there was a beautiful horticultural show, something was always prompting
      her to say, while in this quasi-privacy, that she was on the eve of
      departure, but she kept her resolution against it&mdash;she thought it
      would have been an unwarrantable experiment. When they returned to their
      inn they found Norman looking fagged, but relieved, half asleep on the
      sofa, with a novel in his hand. He roused himself as they came in, and, to
      avoid any compliments on his own performance, began, &ldquo;Well, Ethel, are you
      ready for the ball?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall spare her the ball,&rdquo; said Dr. May; &ldquo;there is a report about the
      Alcestis in the newspaper that may make Margaret uncomfortable, and this
      good sister will not stay away from her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norman started up crying, &ldquo;What, papa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a mere nothing in reality,&rdquo; said Dr. May, &ldquo;only what we knew
      before;&rdquo; and he showed his son the paragraph, which Norman read as a death
      warrant; the colour ebbed from his lips and cheeks; he trembled so that he
      was obliged to sit down, and, without speaking, he kept his eyes fixed on
      the words, &ldquo;Serious apprehensions are entertained with regard to H. M. S.
      Alcestis, Captain Gordon&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you had seen as many newspaper reports come to nothing, as I have, you
      would not take this so much to heart,&rdquo; said Dr. May. &ldquo;I expect to hear
      that this very mail has brought letters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Meta added that, at luncheon, she had been seated next to one of the
      honorary doctors&mdash;a naval captain&mdash;who had been making
      discoveries in the South Sea, and that he had scouted the notion of harm
      befalling the Alcestis, and given all manner of reassuring suppositions as
      to her detention, adding besides, that no one believed the Australian
      paper whence the report was taken. He had seen the Alcestis, knew Captain
      Gordon, and spoke of him as one of the safest people in the world. Had his
      acquaintance extended to lieutenants and midshipmen, it would have been
      perfect; as it was, the tidings brought back the blood to Norman&rsquo;s cheek,
      and the light to his eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When do we set off?&rdquo; was Norman&rsquo;s question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At five,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;You mean it, papa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did intend it, if I had gone alone, but I shall not take you till
      eight; nor you, Norman, at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norman was bent on returning, but his father and Flora would not hear of
      it. Flora could not spare him, and Dr. May was afraid of the effect of
      anxiety on nerves and spirits so sensitive. While this was going on, Mr.
      Ogilvie looked at Ethel in consternation, and said, &ldquo;Are you really going
      home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my eldest sister must not be left alone when she hears this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked down&mdash;Ethel had the resolution to walk away. Flora could
      not give up the ball, and Meta found that she must go; but both the
      Normans spent a quiet evening with Dr. May and Ethel. Norman May had a bad
      headache, which he was allowed to have justly earned; Dr. May was very
      happy reviving all his Scottish recollections, and talking to young
      Ogilvie about Edinburgh. Once, there was a private consultation. Ethel was
      provoked and ashamed at the throbs that it would excite. What! on a week&rsquo;s
      acquaintance?
    </p>
    <p>
      When alone with her father, she began to nerve herself for something
      heroic, and great was her shame when she heard only of her cousin&rsquo;s kind
      consideration for her brother, whom he wished to take home with him, and
      thence to see the Highlands, so as to divert his anxiety for Harry, as
      well as to call him off from the studies with which he had this term
      overworked himself even more than usual. Dr. May had given most grateful
      consent, and he spoke highly in praise of the youth; but there was no more
      to come, and Ethel could have beaten herself for the moment of
      anticipation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meta came home, apologising for wakening Ethel; but Ethel had not been
      asleep. The ball had not, it seemed, been as charming to her as most
      events were, and Ethel heard a sigh as the little lady lay down in her
      bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late as it was when she went to rest, Meta rose to see the travellers off;
      she sent hosts of messages to her father, and wished she might go with
      them. George and Flora were not visible, and Dr. May was leaving messages
      for them, and for Norman, in her charge, when the two Balliol men walked
      in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel had hoped it was over, yet she could not be sorry that the two
      youths escorted them to the station, and, as Ethel was placed in the
      carriage, she believed that she heard something of never forgetting&mdash;happiest
      week&mdash;but in the civilities which the other occupant of the carriage
      was offering for the accommodation of their lesser luggage, she lost the
      exact words, and the last she heard were, &ldquo;Good-bye; I hope you will find
      letters at home.&rdquo;

     True to the kindred points of Heaven and home.
                                             WORDSWORTH.
</pre>
    <p>
      Etheldred&rsquo;s dream was over. She had wakened to the inside of a Great
      Western carriage, her father beside her, and opposite a thin,
      foreign-looking gentleman. Her father, to whom her life was to be devoted!
      She looked at his profile, defined against the window, and did not repent.
      In a sort of impulse to do something for him, she took his hat from his
      hand, and was going to dispose of it in the roof, when he turned, smiling
      his thanks, but saying, &ldquo;it was not worth while&mdash;this carriage was a
      very transitory resting-place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stranger at that moment sprang to his feet, exclaiming, &ldquo;Dick
      himself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spencer, old fellow, is it you?&rdquo; cried Dr. May, in a voice of equal
      amazement and joy, holding out his hand, which was grasped and wrung with
      a force that made Ethel shrink for the poor maimed arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! what is amiss with your arm?&rdquo; was the immediate question. Three
      technical words were spoken in a matter-of-fact way, as Dr. May replaced
      his hand in his bosom, and then, with an eager smile, said, &ldquo;Ethel, here!
      You have heard of him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel had indeed, and gave her hand cordially, surprised by the bow and
      air of deferential politeness with which it was received, like a favour,
      while Dr. Spencer asked her whether she had been staying in Oxford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay; and what for, do you think?&rdquo; said Dr. May joyously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say that was your son who held forth yesterday! I thought his
      voice had a trick of yours&mdash;but then I thought you would have held by
      old Cambridge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What could I do?&rdquo; said Dr. May deprecatingly; &ldquo;the boy would go and get a
      Balliol scholarship&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why! the lad is a genius! a poet&mdash;no mistake about it! but I
      scarcely thought you could have one of such an age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of his age! His brother is in Holy Orders&mdash;one of his sisters is
      married. There&rsquo;s for you, Spencer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless me, Dick! I thought myself a young man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! with hair of that colour?&rdquo; said Dr. May, looking at his friend&rsquo;s
      milk-white locks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bleached by that frightful sickly season at Poonshedagore, when I thought
      I was done for. But you! you&mdash;the boy of the whole lot! You think me
      very disrespectful to your father,&rdquo; added he, turning to Ethel, &ldquo;but you
      see what old times are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Ethel, with a bright look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you were in the theatre yesterday,&rdquo; continued Dr. May; &ldquo;but there is
      no seeing any one in such a throng. How long have you been in England?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fortnight. I went at once to see my sister, at Malvern; there I fell in
      with Rudden, the man I was with in New Guinea. He was going up to be made
      an honorary doctor, and made me come with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where are you bound for?&rdquo; as the train showed signs of a halt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For London. I meant to hunt up Mat. Fleet, and hear of you, and other old
      friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he expect you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one expects me. I am a regular vagabond.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come home with us,&rdquo; said Dr. May, laying his hand on his arm. &ldquo;I cannot
      part with you so soon. Come, find your luggage. Take your ticket for
      Gloucester.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So suddenly! Will it not be inconvenient?&rdquo; said he, looking tempted, but
      irresolute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, no; pray come!&rdquo; said Ethel eagerly. &ldquo;We shall be so glad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked his courteous thanks, and soon was with them en-route for
      Stoneborough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel&rsquo;s thoughts were diverted from all she had left at Oxford. She could
      not but watch those two old friends. She knew enough of the traveller to
      enter into her father&rsquo;s happiness, and to have no fears is of another Sir
      Matthew.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had been together at Stoneborough, at Cambridge, at Paris, at
      Edinburgh, always linked in the closest friendship; but, by Dr. May&rsquo;s own
      account, his friend had been the diligent one of the pair, a bright
      compound of principle and spirit, and highly distinguished in all his
      studies, and Dr. May&rsquo;s model of perfection. Their paths had since lain far
      apart, and they had not seen each other since, twenty-six years ago, they
      had parted in London&mdash;the one to settle at his native town, while the
      other accepted a situation as travelling physician. On his return, he had
      almost sacrificed his life, by self-devoted attendance on a fever-stricken
      emigrant-ship. He had afterwards received an appointment in India, and
      there the correspondence had died away, and Dr. May had lost traces of
      him, only knowing that, in a visitation of cholera, he had again acted
      with the same carelessness of his own life, and a severe illness, which
      had broken up his health, had occasioned him to relinquish his post.
    </p>
    <p>
      It now appeared that he had thought himself coming home ever since. He had
      gone to recruit in the Himalayas, and had become engrossed in scientific
      observations on their altitudes, as well as investigations in natural
      history. Going to Calcutta, he had fallen in with a party about to explore
      the Asiatic islands and he had accompanied them, as well as going on an
      expedition into the interior of Australia. He had been employed in various
      sanitary arrangements there and in India, and had finally worked his way
      slowly home, overland, visiting Egypt and Palestine, and refreshing his
      memory with every Italian, German, or French Cathedral, or work of art,
      that had delighted him in early days.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a slight small man, much sunburned, nearly bald, and his hair
      snowy, but his eyes were beautiful, very dark, soft, and smiling, and yet
      their gaze peculiarly keen and steady, as if ready for any emergency, and
      his whole frame was full of alertness and vigour. His voice was clear and
      sweet, and his manner most refined and polished, indeed, his courtesy to
      Ethel, whenever there was a change of carriage, was so exemplary, that she
      understood it as the effect on a chivalrous mind, of living where a lady
      was a rare and precious article. It frightened Ethel a little at first,
      but, before the end of the journey, she had already begun to feel towards
      him like an old friend&mdash;one of those inheritances who are so much
      valued and loved, like a sort of uncles-in-friendship. She had an especial
      grateful honour for the delicate tact which asked no questions, as she saw
      his eye often falling anxiously on her father&rsquo;s left hand, where the
      wedding ring shone upon the little finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was talk enough upon his travels, on public changes, and on old
      friends; but, after those first few words, home had never been mentioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, at five o&rsquo;clock, the engine blew its whistle, at the old familiar
      station, Dr. May had scarcely put his head out before Adams hastened up to
      him with a note.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All well at home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, Miss Margaret sent up the gig.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go at once,&rdquo; said Dr May hastily&mdash;&ldquo;the Larkins&rsquo; child is
      worse. Ethel, take care of him, and introduce him. Love to Margaret. I&rsquo;ll
      be at home before tea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was driven off at speed, and Ethel proposed to walk home. Dr Spencer
      gave her his arm, and was silent, but presently said, in a low, anxious
      voice, &ldquo;My dear, you must forgive me, I have heard nothing for many years.
      Your mother&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was an accident,&rdquo; said Ethel looking straight before her. &ldquo;It was when
      papa&rsquo;s arm was hurt. The carriage was over-turned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&mdash;&rdquo; repeated Dr Spencer earnestly
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was killed on the spot,&rdquo; said Ethel, speaking shortly, and abruptly.
      If she was to say it at all, she could not do so otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was dreadfully shocked&mdash;she knew it by the shudder of his arm, and
      a tight suppressed groan. He did not speak, and Ethel, as if a relief from
      the silence must be made, said what was not very consoling, and equally
      blunt. &ldquo;Margaret had some harm done to her spine&mdash;she cannot walk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not seem to hear, but walked on, as in a dream, where Ethel guided
      him, and she would not interrupt him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had just passed Mr Bramshaw&rsquo;s office, when a voice was heard behind,
      calling, &ldquo;Miss Ethel! Miss Ethel!&rdquo; and Edward Anderson, now articled to
      Mr. Bramshaw, burst out, pen in hand, and looking shabby and inky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Ethel!&rdquo; he said breathlessly, &ldquo;I beg your pardon, but have you heard
      from Harry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;Have they had that paper at home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that I know of,&rdquo; said Edward. &ldquo;My mother wanted to send it, but I
      would not take it&mdash;not while Dr. May was away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you&mdash;that was very kind of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And oh! Miss Ethel, do you think it is true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We hope not,&rdquo; said Ethel kindly&mdash;&ldquo;we saw a Captain at Oxford who
      thought it not at all to be depended on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so glad,&rdquo; said Edward; and, shaking hands, he went back to his high
      stool, Ethel feeling that he deserved the pains that Norman had taken to
      spare and befriend him. She spoke to her companion in explanation. &ldquo;We are
      very anxious for news of my next brother&rsquo;s ship, Alcestis, in the Pacific&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More!&rdquo; exclaimed poor Dr. Spencer, almost overpowered; &ldquo;Good Heavens! I
      thought May, at least, was happy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is not unhappy,&rdquo; said Ethel, not sorry that they had arrived at the
      back entrance of the shrubbery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long ago was this?&rdquo; said he, standing still, as soon as they had
      passed into the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four years, next October. I assure you, his spirits are almost always
      good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I was at Adelaide, little thinking!&rdquo; he sighed, then recollecting
      himself. &ldquo;Forgive me, I have given you pain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;or rather, I gave you more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew her&mdash;&rdquo; and there he broke off, paused for a minute, then
      collecting himself, seemed resolutely to turn away from the subject, and
      said, walking on, &ldquo;This garden is not much altered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment, a little shrill voice broke out in remonstrance among the
      laurels&mdash;&ldquo;But you know, Daisy, you are the captain of the forty
      thieves!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A startling announcement!&rdquo; said Dr. Spencer, looking at Ethel, and the
      next two steps brought them in view of the play-place in the laurels,
      where Aubrey lay on the ground, feigning sleep, but keeping a watchful eye
      over Blanche, who was dropping something into the holes of inverted
      flower-pots, Gertrude dancing about in a way that seemed to have called
      for the reproof of the more earnest actors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ethel! Ethel!&rdquo; screamed the children, with one voice, and, while the two
      girls stood in shyness at her companion, Aubrey had made a dart at her
      neck, and hung upon her, arms, legs, body, and all, like a wild cat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will do! that will do, old man&mdash;let go! Speak to Dr. Spencer,
      my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Blanche did so demurely, and asked where was papa?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coming, as soon as he has been to Mrs. Larkins&rsquo;s poor baby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George Larkins has been here,&rdquo; said Aubrey. &ldquo;And I have finished &lsquo;Vipera
      et lima&rsquo;, Ethel, but Margaret makes such false quantities!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your name, youngster?&rdquo; said Dr. Spencer, laying his hand on
      Aubrey&rsquo;s head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aubrey Spencer May,&rdquo; was the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey day! where did you steal my name?&rdquo; exclaimed Dr. Spencer, while
      Aubrey stood abashed at so mysterious an accusation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed Blanche, seizing on Ethel, and whispering, &ldquo;is it really
      the boy that climbed the market cross?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see your fame lives here,&rdquo; said Ethel, smiling, as Dr. Spencer
      evidently heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was a little boy!&rdquo; said Aubrey indignantly, looking at the gray-haired
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; said Ethel to Dr. Spencer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The tables turned!&rdquo; he said, laughing heartily. &ldquo;But do not let me keep
      you. You would wish to prepare your sister for a stranger, and I shall
      improve my acquaintance here. Where are the forty thieves?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am all of them,&rdquo; said the innocent, daisy-faced Gertrude; and Ethel
      hastened towards the house, glad of the permission granted by his true
      good-breeding.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a shriek of welcome from Mary, who sat working beside Margaret.
      Ethel was certain that no evil tidings had come to her eldest sister, so
      joyous was her exclamation of wonder and rebuke to her home-sick Ethel.
      &ldquo;Naughty girl! running home at once! I did think you would have been happy
      there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I was,&rdquo; said Ethel hastily; &ldquo;but who do you think I have brought
      home?&rdquo; Margaret flushed with such a pink, that Ethel resolved never to set
      her guessing again, and hurried to explain; and having heard that all was
      well, and taken her housekeeping measures, she proceeded to fetch the
      guest; but Mary, who had been unusually silent all this time, ran after
      her, and checked her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ethel, have you heard?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you?&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George Larkins rode in this morning to see when papa would come home, and
      he told me. He said I had better not tell Margaret, for he did not believe
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have not! That is very good of you, Mary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I am glad you are come! I could not have helped telling, if you had
      been away a whole week! But, Ethel, does papa believe it?&rdquo; Poor Mary&rsquo;s
      full lip swelled, and her eyes swam, ready to laugh or weep, in full faith
      in her sister&rsquo;s answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel told of Meta&rsquo;s captain, and the smile predominated, and settled down
      into Mary&rsquo;s usual broad beamy look, like a benignant rising sun on the
      sign of an inn, as Ethel praised her warmly for a fortitude and
      consideration of which she had not thought her capable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Spencer was discovered full in the midst of the comedy of the forty
      thieves, alternating, as required, between the robber-captain and the ass,
      and the children in perfect ecstasies with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      They all followed in his train to the drawing-room, and were so clamorous,
      that he could have no conversation with Margaret. He certainly made them
      so, but Ethel, remembering what a blow her disclosures had been, thought
      it would be only a kindness to send Aubrey to show him to his room, where
      he might have some peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was not sorry to be very busy, so as to have little time to reply to
      the questions on the doings at Oxford, and the cause of her sudden return;
      and yet it would have been a comfort to be able to sit down to understand
      herself, and recall her confused thoughts. But solitary reflection was a
      thing only to be hoped for in that house in bed, and Ethel was obliged to
      run up and down, and attend to everybody, under an undefined sense that
      she had come home to a dull, anxious world of turmoil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret seemed to guess nothing, that was one comfort; she evidently
      thought that her return was fully accounted for by the fascination of her
      papa&rsquo;s presence in a strange place. She gave Ethel no credit for the
      sacrifice, naturally supposing that she could not enjoy herself away from
      home. Ethel did not know whether to be glad or not; she was relieved, but
      it was flat. As to Norman Ogilvie, one or two inquiries whether she liked
      him, and if Norman were going to Scotland with him, were all that passed,
      and it was very provoking to be made so hot and conscious by them.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not begin to dress till late, and while she was unpacking, she
      heard her father come home, among the children&rsquo;s loud welcomes, and go to
      the drawing-room. He presently knocked at the door between their rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So Margaret does not know?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Mary has been so very good;&rdquo; and she told what had passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well done, Mary, I must tell her so. She is a good girl on a pinch, you
      see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we don&rsquo;t speak of it now? Or will it hurt Margaret more to think we
      keep things from her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the worst risk of the two. I have seen great harm done in that
      way. Mention it, but without seeming to make too much of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you, papa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better&mdash;it will seem of less importance. I think nothing of
      it myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, Ethel saw that he could not trust himself to broach the
      subject to Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How was the Larkins&rsquo; baby?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doing better. What have you done with Spencer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I put him into Richard&rsquo;s room. The children were eating him up! He is so
      kind to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay! I say, Ethel, that was a happy consequence of your coming home with
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a delightful person he is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he not? A true knight errant, as he always was! I could not tell you
      what I owed to him as a boy&mdash;all my life, I may say. Ethel,&rdquo; he added
      suddenly: &ldquo;we must do our best to make him happy here. I know it now&mdash;I
      never guessed it then, but one is very hard and selfish when one is happy&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean, papa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see it now,&rdquo; continued Dr. May incoherently; &ldquo;the cause of his
      wandering life&mdash;advantages thrown aside. He! the most worthy. Things
      I little heeded at the time have come back on me! I understand why he
      banished himself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Ethel bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She never had an idea of it; but I might have guessed from what fell from
      him unconsciously, for not a word would he have said&mdash;nor did he say,
      to show how he sacrificed himself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was it? Aunt Flora?&rdquo; said Ethel, beginning to collect his meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Ethel, it was your own dear mother! You will think this another
      romantic fancy of mine, but I am sure of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&mdash;what? Ah! I remembered after we parted that he might know
      nothing&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He asked me,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how did he bear it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel told, and the tears filled her father&rsquo;s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was wrong and cruel in me to bring him home unprepared! and then to
      leave it to you. I always forget other people&rsquo;s feelings. Poor Spencer!
      And now, Ethel, you see what manner of man we have here, and how we ought
      to treat him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The most unselfish&mdash;the most self-sacrificing&mdash;&rdquo; continued Dr.
      May. &ldquo;And to see what it all turned on! I happened to have this place open
      to me&mdash;the very cause, perhaps, of my having taken things easy&mdash;and
      so the old Professor threw opportunities in my way; while Aubrey Spencer,
      with every recommendation that man could have, was set aside, and exiled
      himself, leaving the station, and all he might so easily have gained. Ah,
      Ethel, Sir Matthew Fleet never came near him in ability. But not one word
      to interfere with me would he say, and&mdash;how I have longed to meet him
      again, after parting in my selfish, unfeeling gladness; and now I have
      nothing to do for him, but show him how little I was to be trusted with
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel never knew how to deal with these occasional bursts of grief, but
      she said that she thought Dr. Spencer was very much pleased to have met
      with him, and delighted with the children.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! well, you are her children,&rdquo; said Dr. May, with his hand on Ethel&rsquo;s
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they went downstairs, and found Mary making tea; and Margaret, fearing
      Dr. Spencer was overwhelmed with his young admirers&mdash;for Aubrey and
      Gertrude were one on each knee, and Blanche standing beside him,
      inflicting on him a catalogue of the names and ages of all the eleven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ethel has introduced you, I see,&rdquo; said Dr. May.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, I assure you, it was an alarming introduction. No sooner do I enter
      your garden, than I hear that I am in the midst of the Forty Thieves. I
      find a young lady putting the world to death, after the fashion of Hamlet&mdash;and,
      looking about to find what I have lost, I find this urchin has robbed me
      of my name&mdash;a property I supposed was always left to unfortunate
      travellers, however small they might be chopped themselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Aubrey boy, will you make restitution?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my name,&rdquo; said Aubrey positively; for, as his father added, &ldquo;He is
      not without dread of the threat being fulfilled, and himself left to be
      that Anon who, Blanche says, writes so much poetry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aubrey privately went to Ethel, to ask her if this were possible; and she
      had to reassure him, by telling him that they were &ldquo;only in fun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was fun with a much deeper current though; for Dr. Spencer was saying,
      with a smile, between gratification and sadness, &ldquo;I did not think my name
      would have been remembered here so long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We had used up mine, and the grandfathers&rsquo;, and the uncles&rsquo;, and began to
      think we might look a little further a-field,&rdquo; said Dr. May. &ldquo;If I had
      only known where you were, I would have asked you to be the varlet&rsquo;s
      godfather; but I was much afraid you were nowhere in the land of the
      living.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have but one godson, and he is coffee-coloured! I ought to have
      written; but, you see, for seven years I thought I was coming home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aubrey had recovered sufficiently to observe to Blanche, &ldquo;That was almost
      as bad as Ulysses,&rdquo; which, being overheard and repeated, led to the
      information that he was Ethel&rsquo;s pupil, whereupon Dr. Spencer began to
      inquire after the school, and to exclaim at his friend for having deserted
      it in the person of Tom. Dr. May looked convicted, but said it was all
      Norman&rsquo;s fault; and Dr. Spencer, shaking his head at Blanche, opined that
      the young gentleman was a great innovater, and that he was sure he was at
      the bottom of the pulling down the Market Cross, and the stopping up
      Randall&rsquo;s Alley&mdash;iniquities of the &ldquo;nasty people,&rdquo; of which she
      already had made him aware.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Norman, he suffered enough anent Randall&rsquo;s Alley,&rdquo; said Dr. May;
      &ldquo;but as to the Market Cross, that came down a year before he was born.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the Town Council!&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of the ordinary stultifications of Town Councils?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care, Spencer,&rdquo; said Dr. May. &ldquo;I am a Town Council man my-self&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, Dick!&rdquo; and he turned with a start of astonishment, and went into a
      fit of laughing, re-echoed by all the young ones, who were especially
      tickled by hearing, from another, the abbreviation that had, hitherto,
      only lived in the favourite expletive, &ldquo;As sure as my name is Dick May.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Dr. May. &ldquo;&lsquo;Dost thou not suspect my place? Dost thou not
      suspect my years? One that hath two gowns, and everything handsome about
      him!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His friend laughed the more, and they betook themselves to the College
      stories, of which the quotation from Dogberry seemed to have reminded
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something curious and affecting in their manner to each other.
      Often it was the easy bantering familiarity of the two youths they had
      once been together, with somewhat of elder brotherhood on Dr. Spencer&rsquo;s
      side&mdash;and of looking up on Dr. May&rsquo;s&mdash;and just as they had
      recurred to these terms, some allusion would bring back to Dr. Spencer,
      that the heedless, high-spirited &ldquo;Dick,&rdquo; whom he had always had much ado
      to keep out of scrapes, was a householder, a man of weight and influence;
      a light which would at first strike him as most ludicrous, and then mirth
      would end in a sigh, for there was yet another aspect! After having
      thought of him so long as the happy husband of Margaret Mackenzie, he
      found her place vacant, and the trace of deep grief apparent on the
      countenance, once so gay&mdash;the oppression of anxiety marked on the
      brow, formerly so joyous, the merriment almost more touching than gravity
      would have been, for the former nature seemed rather shattered than
      altered. In merging towards this side, there was a tender respect in Dr.
      Spencer&rsquo;s manner that was most beautiful, though this evening such
      subjects were scrupulously kept at the utmost distance, by the constant
      interchange of new and old jokes and stories.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only when bed-time had come, and Margaret had been carried off&mdash;did a
      silence fall on the two friends, unbroken till Dr. May rose and proposed
      going upstairs. When he gave his hand to wish good-night, Dr. Spencer held
      it this time most carefully, and said, &ldquo;Oh, May! I did not expect this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have prepared you,&rdquo; said his host, &ldquo;but I never recollected that
      you knew nothing&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had dwelt on your happiness!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There never were two happier creatures for twenty-two years,&rdquo; said Dr.
      May, his voice low with emotion. &ldquo;Sorrow spared her! Yes, think of her
      always in undimmed brightness&mdash;always smiling as you remember her.
      She was happy. She is,&rdquo; he concluded. His friend had turned aside and
      hidden his face with his hands, then looked up for a moment, &ldquo;And you,
      Dick,&rdquo; he said briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorrow spared her,&rdquo; was Dr. May&rsquo;s first answer. &ldquo;And hers are very good
      children!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a silence again, ending in Dr. May&rsquo;s saying, &ldquo;What do you think
      of my poor girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They discussed the nature of the injury: Dr. Spencer could not feel
      otherwise than that it was a very hopeless matter. Her father owned that
      he had thought so from the first, and had wondered at Sir Matthew Fleet&rsquo;s
      opinion. His subdued tone of patience and resignation, struck his guest
      above all, as changed from what he had once been.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been sorely tried,&rdquo; he said, when they parted at his room door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have received much good!&rdquo; simply answered Dr. May. &ldquo;Goodnight! I am
      glad to have you here&mdash;if you can bear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bear it? Dick! how like that girl is to you! She is yourself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such a self as I never was! Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel overcame the difficulty of giving the account of the newspaper alarm
      with tolerable success, by putting the story of Meta&rsquo;s conversation
      foremost. Margaret did not take it to heart as much as she had feared, nor
      did she appear to dwell on it afterwards. The truth was perhaps that Dr.
      Spencer&rsquo;s visit was to every one more of an excitement and amusement than
      it was to Ethel. Not that she did not like him extremely, but after such a
      week as she had been spending, the home-world seemed rather stale and
      unprofitable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Bracy relapsed into a state of &ldquo;feelings,&rdquo; imagining that Ethel had
      distrusted her capabilities, and therefore returned; or as Ethel herself
      sometimes feared, there might be irritability in her own manner that gave
      cause of annoyance. The children were inclined to be riotous with their
      new friend, who made much of them continually, and especially patronised
      Aubrey; Mary was proud of showing how much she had learned to do for
      Margaret in her sister&rsquo;s absence; Dr. May was so much taken up with his
      friend, that Ethel saw less of him than usual, and she began to believe
      that it had been all a mistake that every one was so dependent on her,
      for, in fact, they did much better without her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, she heard of the gaieties which the others were enjoying, and
      she could not feel heroic when they regretted her. At the end of a week,
      Meta Rivers was escorted home from Warwick by two servants, and came to
      Stoneborough, giving a lively description of all the concluding pleasures,
      but declaring that Ethel&rsquo;s departure had taken away the zest of the whole,
      and Mr. Ogilvie had been very disconsolate. Margaret had not been prepared
      to hear that Mr. Ogilvie had been so constant a companion, and was struck
      by finding that Ethel had passed over one who had evidently been so great
      an ingredient in the delights of the expedition. Meta had, however
      observed nothing&mdash;she was a great deal too simple and too much
      engrossed for such notions to have crossed her mind; but Margaret inferred
      something, and hoped to learn more when she should see Flora. This would
      not be immediately. George and his wife were gone to London, and thence
      intended to pay a round of visits; and Norman had accompanied his namesake
      to Glenbracken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel fought hard with her own petulance and sense of tedium at home,
      which was, as she felt, particularly uncalled for at present; when Dr.
      Spencer was enlivening them so much. He was never in the way, he was
      always either busy in the dining-room in the morning with books and
      papers, or wandering about his old school-boy haunts in the town, or
      taking Adam&rsquo;s place, and driving out Dr. May, or sometimes joining the
      children in a walk, to their supreme delight. His sketches, for he drew
      most beautifully, were an endless pleasure to Margaret, with his
      explanations of them&mdash;she even tried to sit up to copy them, and he
      began to teach Blanche to draw. The evenings, when there was certain to be
      some entertaining talk going on between the two doctors, were very
      charming, and Margaret seemed quite revived by seeing her father so happy
      with his friend. Ethel knew she ought to be happy also, and if attention
      could make her so, she had it, for kind and courteous as Dr. Spencer was
      to all, she seemed to have a double charm for him. It was as if he found
      united in her the quaint brusquerie, that he had loved in her father, with
      somewhat of her mother; for though Ethel had less personal resemblance to
      Mrs. May than any other of the family, Dr. Spencer transferred to her much
      of the chivalrous distant devotion, with which he had regarded her mother.
      Ethel was very little conscious of it, but he was certainly her sworn
      knight, and there was an eagerness in his manner of performing every
      little service for her, a deference in his way of listening to her, over
      and above his ordinary polish of manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel lighted up, and enjoyed herself when talking was going on&mdash;her
      periods of ennui were when she had to set about any home employment&mdash;when
      Aubrey&rsquo;s lessons did not go well&mdash;when she wanted to speak to her
      father, and could not catch him; and even when she had to go to Cocksmoor.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not seem to make any progress there&mdash;the room was very full,
      and very close, the children were dull, and she began to believe she was
      doing no good&mdash;it was all a weariness. But she was so heartily
      ashamed of her feelings, that she worked the more vehemently for them, and
      the utmost show that they outwardly made was, that Margaret thought her
      less vivacious than her wont, and she was a little too peremptory at times
      with Mary and Blanche. She had so much disliked the display that Flora had
      made about Cocksmoor, that she had imposed total silence on it upon her
      younger sisters, and Dr. Spencer had spent a fortnight at Stoneborough
      without being aware of their occupation; when there occurred such an
      extremely sultry day, that Margaret remonstrated with Ethel on her
      intention of broiling herself and Mary by walking to Cocksmoor, when the
      quicksilver stood at 80° in the shade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel was much inclined to stay at home, but she did not know whether this
      was from heat or from idleness, and her fretted spirits took the turn of
      determination&mdash;so she posted off at a galloping pace, that her
      brothers called her &ldquo;Cocksmoor speed,&rdquo; and Mary panted by her side, humbly
      petitioning for the plantation path, when she answered &ldquo;that it was as
      well to be hot in the sun as in the shade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The school-room was unusually full, all the haymaking mothers made it
      serve as an infant school, and though as much window was opened as there
      could be, the effect was not coolness. Nevertheless, Ethel sat down and
      gathered her class round her, and she had just heard the chapter once
      read, when there was a little confusion, a frightened cry of &ldquo;Ethel!&rdquo; and
      before she could rise to her feet&mdash;a flump upon the floor&mdash;poor
      Mary had absolutely fainted dead away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel was much terrified, and very angry with herself; Mary was no light
      weight, but Mrs. Elwood coming at their cry, helped Ethel to drag her into
      the outer room, where she soon began to recover, and to be excessively
      puzzled as to what had happened to her. She said the sea was roaring, and
      where was Harry? and then she looked much surprised to find herself lying
      on Mrs. Elwood&rsquo;s damp flags&mdash;a circumstance extremely distressing to
      Mrs. Elwood, who wanted to carry her upstairs into Cherry&rsquo;s room, very
      clean and very white, but with such a sun shining full into it!
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel lavished all care, and reproached herself greatly, though to be sure
      nothing had ever been supposed capable of hurting Mary, and Mary herself
      protested that nothing at all had ailed her till the children&rsquo;s voices
      began to sound funny, and turned into the waves of the sea, and therewith
      poor Mary burst into a great flood of tears, and asked whether Harry would
      ever come back. The tears did her a great deal of good, though not so much
      as the being petted by Ethel, and she soon declared herself perfectly
      well; but Ethel could not think of letting her walk home, and sent off a
      boy&mdash;who she trusted would not faint&mdash;with a note to Margaret,
      desiring her to send the gig, which fortunately was at home to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary had partaken of some of Mrs. Elwood&rsquo;s tea, which, though extremely
      bitter, seemed a great cordial, and was sitting, quite revived, in the
      arbour at the door, when the gig stopped, and Dr. Spencer walked in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and how are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite well now, thank you. Was Margaret frightened? Why did you come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought it would make her happier, as your father was not at home.
      Here, let me feel your pulse. Do you think no one is a doctor but your
      papa? There&rsquo;s not much the matter with you, however. Where is Ethel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the school,&rdquo; and Mary opened the door. Dr. Spencer looked in, as Ethel
      came out, and his face put her in mind of Norman&rsquo;s look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No wonder!&rdquo; was all he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel was soon satisfied that he did not think Mary ill. In fact, he said
      fainting was the most natural and justifiable measure, under the
      circumstances. &ldquo;How many human creatures do you keep there?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forty-seven to-day,&rdquo; said Mary proudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall indict you for cruelty to animals! I think I have known it hotter
      at Poonshedagore, but there we had punkahs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was very wrong of me,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;I should have thought of poor
      Mary, in that sunny walk, but Mary never complains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, never mind,&rdquo; said Mary, &ldquo;it did not hurt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not thinking of Mary,&rdquo; said Dr. Spencer, &ldquo;but of the wretched beings
      you are leaving shut up there. I wonder what the mercury would be there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We cannot help it,&rdquo; said Mary. &ldquo;We cannot get the ground.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Mary, having been voted into the seat of honour and comfort by his
      side in the carriage, told her version of Cocksmoor and the Committee;
      while Ethel sat up in the little narrow seat behind, severely reproaching
      herself for her want of consideration towards one so good and patient as
      Mary, who proved to have been suffering far more on Harry&rsquo;s account than
      they had guessed, and who was so simple and thorough-going in doing her
      duty. This was not being a good elder sister, and, when they came home,
      she confessed it, and showed so much remorse that poor Mary was quite
      shocked, and cried so bitterly that it was necessary to quit the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ethel, dearest,&rdquo; said Margaret that night, after they were in bed, &ldquo;is
      there anything the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, nothing, but that Oxford has spoiled me,&rdquo; said Ethel, resolutely. &ldquo;I
      am very cross and selfish!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be better by-and-by,&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;if only you are sure you
      have nothing to make you unhappy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said Ethel. She was becoming too much ashamed of her fancy to
      breathe one word about it, and she had spoken the truth. Pleasure had
      spoiled her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If only we could do something for Cocksmoor!&rdquo; she sighed, presently,
      &ldquo;with that one hundred and fifty pounds lying idle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret was very glad that her thoughts were taking this channel, but it
      was not a promising one, for there seemed to be nothing practicable,
      present or future. The ground could not be had&mdash;the pig would not get
      over the stile&mdash;the old woman could not get home to-night. Cocksmoor
      must put up with its present school, and Mary must not be walked to death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or, as Ethel drew her own moral, sacrifice must not be selfish. One great
      resolution that has been costly, must not blunt us in the daily details of
      life.

      &ldquo;Dick,&rdquo; said Dr. Spencer, as the friends sat together in the evening,
      after Mary&rsquo;s swoon, &ldquo;you seem to have found an expedient for making havoc
      among your daughters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does not hurt them,&rdquo; said Dr. May carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty well, after the specimen of to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was chance.&rdquo;

      &ldquo;If you like it, I have no more to say; but I should like to make you sit

     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very fine talking, but I would not take the responsibility of hindering
      the only pains that have ever been taken with that unlucky place. You
      don&rsquo;t know that girl Ethel. She began at fifteen, entirely of her own
      accord, and has never faltered. If any of the children there are saved
      from perdition, it is owing to her, and I am not going to be the man to
      stop her. They are strong, healthy girls, and I cannot see that it does

      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be helped. What would you have said if you had seen the last?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is this about one hundred and fifty pounds in hand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ladies here chose to have a fancy fair, the only result of which,
      hitherto, has been the taking away my Flora. There is the money, but the
      land can&rsquo;t be had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tied up between the Drydale Estate and &mdash;&mdash; College, and in the
      hands of the quarry master, Nicolson. There was an application made to the
      College, but they did not begin at the right end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word, Dick, you take it easy!&rdquo; cried his friend, rather
      indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I own I have not stirred in the matter,&rdquo; said Dr. May. &ldquo;I knew nothing
      would come to good under the pack of silly women that our schools are
      ridden with&mdash;&rdquo; and, as he heard a sound a little like &ldquo;pish!&rdquo; he
      continued, &ldquo;and that old Ramsden, it is absolutely useless to work with
      such a head&mdash;or no head. There&rsquo;s nothing for it but to wait for
      better times, instead of setting up independent, insubordinate action.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are the man to leave venerable abuses undisturbed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The cure is worse than the disease!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There spoke the Corporation!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! it was not the way you set to work in Poonshedagore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, really, when the venerable abuses consisted of Hindoos praying to
      their own three-legged stools, and keeping sacred monkeys in honour of the
      ape Hanyuman, it was a question whether one could be a Christian oneself,
      and suffer it undisturbed. It was coming it too strong, when I was
      requested to lend my own step-ladder for the convenience of an exhibition
      of a devotee swinging on hooks in his sides.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Spencer had, in fact, never rested till he had established a mission
      in his former remote station; and his brown godson, once a Brahmin, now an
      exemplary clergyman, traced his conversion to the friendship and example
      of the English physician.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I have lashed about me at abuses, in my time,&rdquo; said Dr. May.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say you have, Dick!&rdquo; and they both laughed&mdash;the inconsiderate
      way was so well delineated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; replied Dr. May; &ldquo;and I made enemies enough to fetter me now. I
      do not mean that I have done right&mdash;I have not; but there is a good
      deal on my hands, and I don&rsquo;t write easily. I have been slower to take up
      new matters than I ought to have been.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see, I see!&rdquo; said Dr. Spencer, rather sorry for his implied reproach,
      &ldquo;but must Cocksmoor be left to its fate, and your gallant daughter to
      hers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The vicar won&rsquo;t stir. He is indolent enough by nature, and worse with
      gout; and I do not see what good I could do. I once offended the tenant,
      Nicolson, by fining him for cheating his unhappy labourers, on the
      abominable truck system; and he had rather poison me than do anything to
      oblige me. And, as to the copyholder, he is a fine gentleman, who never
      comes near the place, nor does anything for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Henry Walkinghame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Henry Walkinghame! I know the man. I found him in one of the caves at
      Thebes, among the mummies, laid up with a fever, nearly ready to be a
      mummy himself! I remember bleeding him&mdash;irregular, was not it? but
      one does not stand on ceremony in Pharaoh&rsquo;s tomb. I got him through with
      it; we came up the Nile together, and the last I saw of him was at
      Alexandria. He is your man! something might be done with him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe Flora promises to ask him if she should ever meet him in
      London, but he is always away. If ever we should be happy enough to get an
      active incumbent, we shall have a chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two days after, Ethel came down equipped for Cocksmoor. It was as hot as
      ever, and Mary was ordered to stay at home, being somewhat pacified by a
      promise that she should go again as soon as the weather was fit for
      anything but a salamander.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Spencer was in the hall, with his bamboo, his great Panama hat, and
      gray loose coat, for he entirely avoided, except on Sundays, the medical
      suit of black. He offered to relieve Ethel of her bag of books.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No thank you.&rdquo; (He had them by this time). &ldquo;But I am going to Cocksmoor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you allow me to be your companion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be very glad of the pleasure of your company, but I am not in the
      least afraid of going alone,&rdquo; said she, smiling, however, so as to show
      she was glad of such pleasant company. &ldquo;I forewarn you though that I have
      business there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will find occupation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you must promise not to turn against me. I have undergone a great
      deal already about that place. Norman was always preaching against it, and
      now that he has become reasonable, I can&rsquo;t have papa set against it again&mdash;besides,
      he would mind you more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Spencer promised to do nothing but what was quite reasonable. Ethel
      believed that he accompanied her merely because his gallantry would not
      suffer her to go unescorted, and she was not sorry, for it was too long a
      walk for solitude to be very agreeable, when strange wagoners might be on
      the road, though she had never let them be &ldquo;lions in the path.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The walk was as pleasant as a scorching sun would allow, and by the time
      they arrived at the scattered cottages, Ethel had been drawn into
      explaining many of her Cocksmoor perplexities.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you could get the land granted, where should you choose to have it?&rdquo;
       he asked. &ldquo;You know it will not do to go and say, &lsquo;Be pleased to give me a
      piece of land,&rsquo; without specifying what, or you might chance to have one
      at the Land&rsquo;s End.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see, that was one of the blunders,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;But I had often
      thought of this nice little square place, between two gardens, and
      sheltered by the old quarry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! hardly space enough, I should say,&rdquo; replied Dr. Spencer, stepping it
      out. &ldquo;No, that won&rsquo;t do, so confined by the quarry. Let us look farther.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A surmise crossed Ethel. Could he be going to take the work on himself,
      but that was too wild a supposition&mdash;she knew he had nothing of his
      own, only a moderate pension from the East India Company.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of this?&rdquo; he said, coming to the slope of a knoll,
      commanding a pretty view of the Abbotstoke woods, clear from houses, and
      yet not remote from the hamlet. She agreed that it would do well, and he
      kicked up a bit of turf, and pryed into the soil, pronouncing it dry, and
      fit for a good foundation. Then he began to step it out, making a circuit
      that amazed her, but he said, &ldquo;It is of no use to do it at twice. Your
      school can be only the first step towards a church, and you had better
      have room&mdash;enough at once. It will serve as an endowment in the
      meantime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He would not let her remain in the sun, and she went into school. She
      found him, when she came out, sitting in the arbour smoking a cigar-rather
      a shock to her feelings, though he threw it away the instant she appeared,
      and she excused him for his foreign habits.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening, he brought down a traveller&rsquo;s case of instruments, and
      proceeded to draw a beautiful little map of Cocksmoor, where it seemed
      that he had taken all his measurements, whilst she was in school. He ended
      by an imaginary plan and elevation for the school, with a pretty oriel
      window and bell-gable, that made Ethel sigh with delight at the bare idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day, he vanished after dinner, but this he often did; he used to say
      he must go and have a holiday of smoking&mdash;he could not bear too much
      civilised society. He came back for tea, however, and had not sat down
      long before he said, &ldquo;Now, I know all about it. I shall pack up my goods,
      and be off for Vienna to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Vienna!&rdquo; was the general and dolorous outcry, and Gertrude laid hold
      of him and said he should not go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am coming back,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if you will have me. The college holds a
      court at Fordholm on the 3rd, and on the last of this month, I hope to
      return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;College! Court! What are you going to do at Vienna? Where have you left
      your senses?&rdquo; asked Dr. May.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I find Sir Henry Walkinghame is there. I have been on an exploring
      expedition to Drydale, found out his man of business, and where he is to
      be written to. The college holds a court at Fordholm, and I hope to have
      our business settled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel was too much confounded to speak. Her father was exclaiming on the
      shortness of the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plenty of time,&rdquo; said Dr. Spencer, demonstrating that he should be able
      to travel comfortably, and have four days to spare at Vienna&mdash;a
      journey which he seemed to think less of, than did Dr. May of going to
      London.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to checking him, of that there was no possibility, nor, indeed, notion,
      though Ethel did not quite know how to believe in it, nor that the plan
      could come to good. Ethel was much better by this time: by her vigorous
      efforts, she had recovered her tone of mind and interest in what was
      passing; and though now and then Norman&rsquo;s letters, carrying sentences of
      remembrance, made her glow a little, she was so steady to her resolution
      that she averted all traffic in messages through her brother&rsquo;s
      correspondence, and, in that fear, allowed it to lapse into Margaret&rsquo;s
      hands more than she had ever done. Indeed, no one greatly liked writing
      from home, it was heartless work to say always, &ldquo;No news from the
      Alcestis&rdquo; and yet they all declared they were not anxious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hector Ernescliffe knelt a great while beside Margaret&rsquo;s sofa, on the
      first evening of his holidays, and there was a long low-voiced talk
      between them. Ethel wished that she had warned him off, for Margaret
      looked much more harassed and anxious, after having heard the outpouring
      of all that was on his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Spencer thought her looking worse, when he came, as come he did, on
      the appointed day. He had brought Sir Henry Walkinghame&rsquo;s full consent to
      the surrender of the land; drawn up in such form as could be acted upon,
      and a letter to his man of business. But Nicolson! He was a worse dragon
      nearer home, hating all schools, especially hating Dr. May.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, said Dr. Spencer, in eastern form, &ldquo;Have I encountered Rajahs,
      and smoked pipes with three-tailed Pachas, that I should dread the face of
      the father of quarrymen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What he did with the father of quarrymen was not known, whether he talked
      him over, or bought him off&mdash;Margaret hoped the former; Dr. May
      feared the latter; the results were certain; Mr. Nicolson had agreed that
      the land should be given up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The triumphant Dr. Spencer sat down to write a statement to be shown to
      the college authorities, when they should come to hold their court.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The land must be put into the hands of trustees,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The incumbent
      of course?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then yourself; and we must have another. Your son-in-law?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, I should think,&rdquo; said Dr. May.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I! Why, I am going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going, but not gone,&rdquo; said his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go! I tell you, Dick; I must have a place of my own to smoke my
      pipe in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; said Dr. May. &ldquo;I think you might be accommodated here,
      unless you wished to be near your sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My sister is always resorting to watering-places. My nieces do nothing
      but play on the piano. No, I shall perhaps go off to America, the only
      place I have not seen yet, and I more than half engaged to go and help at
      Poonshedagore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better order your coffin then,&rdquo; muttered Dr. May.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall try lodgings in London, near the old hospital, perhaps&mdash;and
      go and turn over the British Museum library.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look you here, Spencer, I have a much better plan. Do you know that scrap
      of a house of mine, by the back gate, just big enough for you and your
      pipe? Set up your staff there. Ethel will never get her school built
      without you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! that would be capital!&rdquo; cried Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be the best speculation for me. You would pay rent, and the last
      old woman never did,&rdquo; continued Dr. May. &ldquo;A garden the length of this one&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I say&mdash;I want to be near the British Museum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take a season-ticket, and run up once a week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall teach your boys to smoke!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see to that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have given Cocksmoor one lift,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;and it will never go on
      without you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is such a nice house!&rdquo; added the children, in chorus; &ldquo;it would be
      such fun to have you there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daisy will never be able to spare her other doctor,&rdquo; said Margaret,
      smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Run to Mrs. Adams, Tom, and get the key,&rdquo; said Dr. May.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a putting on of hats and bonnets, and the whole party walked
      down the garden to inspect the house&mdash;a matter of curiosity to some&mdash;for
      it was where the old lady had resided on whom Harry had played so many
      tricks, and the subject of many myths hatched between him and George
      Larkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an odd, little narrow slip of a house, four stories, of two rooms
      all the way up, each with a large window, with a marked white eyebrow. Dr.
      May eagerly pointed out all the conveniences, parlour, museum, smoking
      den, while Dr. Spencer listened, and answered doubtfully; and the
      children&rsquo;s clamorous anxiety seemed to render him the more silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hector Ernescliffe discovered a jackdaw&rsquo;s nest in the chimney, whereupon
      the whole train rushed off to investigate, leaving the two doctors and
      Ethel standing together in the empty parlour, Dr. May pressing, Dr.
      Spencer raising desultory objections; but so evidently against his own
      wishes, that Ethel said, &ldquo;Now, indeed, you must not disappoint us all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Dr. May, &ldquo;it is a settled thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, thanks, thanks to you all, but it cannot be. Let me go;&rdquo; and he
      spoke with emotion. &ldquo;You are very kind, but it is not to be thought of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; said Dr. May. &ldquo;Spencer, stay with me;&rdquo; and he spoke with a
      pleading, almost dependent air. &ldquo;Why should you go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is of no use to talk about it. You are very kind, but it will not do
      to encumber you with a lone man, growing old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have been young together,&rdquo; said Dr. May.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you must not leave papa,&rdquo; added Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Dr. May. &ldquo;Trouble may be at hand. Help us through with it.
      Remember, these children have no uncles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will stay?&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made a sign of assent&mdash;he could do no more, and just then Gertrude
      came trotting back, so exceedingly smutty, as to call everybody&rsquo;s
      attention. Hector had been shoving Tom half-way up the chimney, in hopes
      of reaching the nest; and the consequences of this amateur
      chimney-sweeping had been a plentiful bespattering of all the spectators
      with soot, that so greatly distressed the young ladies, that Mary and
      Blanche had fled away from public view.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Spencer&rsquo;s first act of possession was to threaten to pull Tom down by
      the heels for disturbing his jackdaws, whereupon there was a general
      acclamation; and Dr. May began to talk of marauding times, when the
      jackdaws in the Minster tower had been harried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Dr. Spencer, as Tom emerged, blacker than the outraged
      jackdaws, and half choked, &ldquo;what do you know about jackdaws&rsquo; nests? You
      that are no Whichcote scholars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; cried Hector, &ldquo;when there is a jackdaw&rsquo;s nest in Eton Chapel,
      twenty feet high.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old Grey made that!&rdquo; said Tom, who usually acted the part of esprit fort
      to Hector&rsquo;s credulity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, there is a picture of it on Jesse&rsquo;s book,&rdquo; said Hector.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But may not we get up on the roof, to see if we can get at the nest,
      papa?&rdquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must ask Dr. Spencer. It is his house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Spencer did not gainsay it, and proceeded even to show the old
      Whichcote spirit, by leading the assault, and promising to take care of
      Aubrey, while Ethel retained Gertrude, and her father too; for Dr. May had
      such a great inclination to scramble up the ladder after them, that she,
      thinking it a dangerous experiment for so helpless an arm, was obliged to
      assure him that it would create a sensation among the gossiphood of
      Stoneborough, if their physician were seen disporting himself on the top
      of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I&rsquo;m not a physician unattached, like him,&rdquo; said Dr. May, laughing.
      &ldquo;Hullo! have you got up, Tom? There&rsquo;s a door up there. I&rsquo;ll show you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t papa. Think of Mrs. Ledwich; and asking her to see two trustees
      up there!&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Mrs. Ledwich; what is to be done with her, Ethel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure I can&rsquo;t tell. If Flora were but at home, she would manage it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spencer can manage anything!&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;That was the happiest
      chance imaginable that you came home with me, and so we came to go by the
      same train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel was only afraid that time was being cruelly wasted; but the best
      men, and it is emphatically the best that generally are so&mdash;have the
      boy strong enough on one side or other of their natures, to be a great
      provocation to womankind; and Dr. Spencer did not rest from his pursuit
      till the brood of the jackdaws had been discovered, and two gray-headed
      nestlings kidnapped, which were destined to a wicker cage and education.
      Little Aubrey was beyond measure proud, and was suggesting all sorts of
      outrageous classical names for them, till politely told by Tom that he
      would make them as great prigs as himself, and that their names should be
      nothing but Jack and Jill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing for it but for Aubrey to go to school,&rdquo; cried Tom,
      sententiously turning round to Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, to Stoneborough,&rdquo; said Dr. Spencer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom coloured, as if sorry for his movement, and hastened away to make
      himself sufficiently clean to go in quest of a prison for his captives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Spencer began to bethink him of the paper that he had been so eagerly
      drawing up, and looking at his own begrimed hands, asked Ethel whether she
      would have him for a trustee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will the other eight ladies?&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the point.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, Spencer! you did not know what you were undertaking. Do you wish to
      be let off?&rdquo; said Dr. May.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; said the undaunted doctor. &ldquo;Come, Ethel, let us hear what should
      be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no time,&rdquo; said Ethel, bewildered. &ldquo;The court will be only on the
      day after to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ample time!&rdquo; said Dr. Spencer, who seemed ready to throw himself into it
      with all his might. &ldquo;What we have to do is this. The ladies to be
      propitiated are&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nine Muses, to whom you will have to act Apollo,&rdquo; said Dr. May, who,
      having put his friend into the situation, had a mischievous delight in
      laughing at him, and watching what he would do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One and two, Ethel, and Mrs. Rivers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather eight and nine,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;though Flora may be somebody now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seven then,&rdquo; said Dr. Spencer. &ldquo;Well then, Ethel, suppose we set out on
      our travels this afternoon. Visit these ladies, get them to call a meeting
      to-morrow, and sanction their three trustees.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You little know what a work it is to call a meeting, or how many notes
      Miss Rich sends out before one can be accomplished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faint heart&mdash;you know the proverb, Ethel. Allons. I&rsquo;ll call on Mrs.
      Ledwich&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay,&rdquo; said Dr. May. &ldquo;Let Ethel do that, and ask her to tea, and we will
      show her your drawing of the school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So the remaining ladies were divided&mdash;Ethel was to visit Miss
      Anderson, Miss Boulder, and Mrs. Ledwich; Dr. Spencer, the rest, and a
      meeting, if possible, be appointed for the next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel did as she was told, though rather against the grain, and her short,
      abrupt manner was excused the more readily, that Dr. Spencer had been a
      subject of much mysterious speculation in Stoneborough, and to gain any
      intelligence respecting him, was a great object; so that she was extremely
      welcome wherever she called.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ledwich promised to come to tea, and instantly prepared to walk to
      Miss Rich, and authorise her to send out the notes of summons to the
      morrow&rsquo;s meeting. Ethel offered to walk with her, and found Mrs. and Miss
      Rich in a flutter, after Dr. Spencer&rsquo;s call; the daughter just going to
      put on her bonnet and consult Mrs. Ledwich, and both extremely enchanted
      with Dr. Spencer, who &ldquo;would be such an acquisition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hour was fixed and the notes sent out, and Ethel met Dr. Spencer at
      the garden gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; he said, smiling, &ldquo;I think we have fixed them off&mdash;have not
      we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but is it not heartless that everything should be done through so
      much nonsense?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever hear why the spire of Ulm Cathedral was never finished?&rdquo;
       said Dr. Spencer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because the citizens would accept no help from their neighbours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad enough of help when it comes in the right way, and from good
      motives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are more good motives in the world than you give people credit for,
      Ethel. You have a good father, good sense, and a good education; and you
      have some perception of the system by which things like this should be
      done. Unfortunately, the system is in bad hands here, and these good
      ladies have been left to work for themselves, and it is no wonder that
      there is plenty of little self-importance, nonsense, and the like, among
      them; but for their own sakes we should rather show them the way, than
      throw them overboard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they will be shown,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say they seemed to me so very formidable,&rdquo; said Dr. Spencer.
      &ldquo;Gentle little women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! it is only Mrs. Ledwich that stirs them up. I hope you are prepared
      for that encounter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ledwich came to tea, sparkling with black bugles, and was very
      patronising and amiable. Her visits were generally subjects of great
      dread, for she talked unceasingly, laid down the law, and overwhelmed
      Margaret with remedies; but to-night Dr. Spencer took her in hand. It was
      not that he went out of his ordinary self, he was always the same
      simple-mannered, polished gentleman; but it was this that told&mdash;she
      was evidently somewhat in awe of him&mdash;the refinement kept her in
      check. She behaved very quietly all the evening, admired the plans,
      consented to everything, and was scarcely Mrs. Ledwich!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will get on now, Ethel,&rdquo; said Dr. May afterwards. &ldquo;Never fear but
      that he will get the Ladies&rsquo; Committee well in hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you think so, papa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never you fear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was all she could extract from him, though he looked very arch. The
      Ladies&rsquo; Committee accepted of their representatives with full consent; and
      the indefatigable Dr. Spencer next had to hunt up the fellow trustee. He
      finally contrived to collect every one he wanted at Fordholm, the case was
      laid before the College&mdash;the College was propitious, and by four
      o&rsquo;clock in the evening, Dr. Spencer laid before Ethel the promise of the
      piece of land.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary&rsquo;s joy was unbounded, and Ethel blushed, and tried to thank. This
      would have been the summit of felicity a year ago, and she was vexed with
      herself for feeling that though land and money were both in such safe
      hands, she could not care sufficiently to feel the ecstasy the attainment
      of her object would once have given to her. Then she would have been
      frantic with excitement, and heedless of everything; now she took it so
      composedly as to annoy herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To think of that one week at Oxford having so entirely turned this head
      of mine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps it was the less at home, because she had just heard that George
      and Flora had accepted an invitation to Glenbracken, but though the zest
      of Cocksmoor might be somewhat gone, she called herself to order, and gave
      her full attention to all that was planned by her champion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never did man plunge into business more thoroughly than he, when he had
      once undertaken it. He was one of those men who, from gathering
      particulars of every practical matter that comes under their notice, are
      able to accomplish well whatever they set their hand to; and building was
      not new to him, though his former subjects&mdash;a church and mission
      station in India&mdash;bore little remembrance to the present.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bought a little round dumpling of a white pony, and trotted all over
      the country in search of building materials and builders, he discovered
      trees in distant timber-yards, he brought home specimens of stone, one in
      each pocket, to compare and analyse, he went to London to look at model
      schools, he drew plans each more neat and beautiful than the last, he
      compared builders&rsquo; estimates, and wrote letters to the National Society,
      so as to be able to begin in the spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime he was settling himself, furnishing his new house with
      great precision and taste. He would have no assistance in his choice,
      either of servants or furniture, but made numerous journeys of inspection
      to Whitford, to Malvern, and to London, and these seemed to make him the
      more content with Stoneborough. Sir Matthew Fleet had evidently chilled
      him, and as he found his own few remaining relations uncongenial, he
      became the more ready to find a resting-place in the gray old town, the
      scene of his school life, beside the friend of his youth, and the children
      of her, for whose sake he had never sought a home of his own. Though he
      now and then talked of seeing America, or of going back to India, in hopes
      of assisting his beloved mission at Poonshedagore, these plans were fast
      dying away, as he formed habits and attachments, and perceived the sphere
      of usefulness open to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a great step when his packages arrived, and his beautiful Indian
      curiosities were arranged, making his drawing-room as pretty a room as
      could anywhere be seen; in readiness, as he used to tell Ethel, for a
      grand tea-party for all the Ladies&rsquo; Committee, when he should borrow her
      and the best silver teapot to preside. Moreover, he had a chemical
      apparatus, a telescope, and microscope, of great power, wherewith he tried
      experiments that were the height of felicity to Tom and Ethel, and much
      interested their father. He made it his business to have full occupation
      for himself, with plans, books, or correspondence, so as not to be a
      charge on the hands of the May family, with whom he never spent an evening
      without special and earnest invitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave attendance at the hospital on alternate days, as well as taking
      off Dr. May&rsquo;s hands such of his gratuitous patients as were not averse to
      quit their old doctor, and could believe in a physician in shepherd&rsquo;s
      plaid, and Panama hat. Exceedingly sociable, he soon visited every one far
      and wide, and went to every sort of party, from the grand dinners of the
      &ldquo;county families,&rdquo; to the tea-drinkings of the Stoneborough ladies&mdash;a
      welcome guest at all, and enjoying each in his own way. English life was
      so new to him that he entered into the little accessories with the zest of
      a youth; and there seemed to be a curious change between the two old
      fellow students, the elder and more staid of former days having come back
      with unencumbered freshness to enliven his friend, just beginning to grow
      aged under the wear of care and sorrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was very droll to hear Dr. May laughing at Dr. Spencer&rsquo;s histories of
      his adventures, and at the new aspects in which his own well-trodden
      district appeared to travelled eyes; and not less amusing was Dr.
      Spencer&rsquo;s resolute defence of all the nine muses, generally and
      individually.
    </p>
    <p>
      He certainly had no reason to think ill of them. As one woman, they were
      led by him, and conformed their opinions. The only seceder was Louisa
      Anderson, who had her brother for her oracle; and, indeed, the more
      youthful race, to whom Harvey was the glass of fashion, uttered
      disrespectful opinions as to the doctor&rsquo;s age, and would not accede to his
      being, as Mrs. Ledwich declared, &ldquo;much younger than Dr. May.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harvey Anderson had first attempted patronage, then argument, with Dr.
      Spencer, but found him equally impervious to both. &ldquo;Very clever, but an
      old world man,&rdquo; said Harvey. &ldquo;He has made up his bundle of prejudices.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clever sort of lad!&rdquo; said Dr. Spencer, &ldquo;a cool hand, but very shallow&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel wondered to hear thus lightly disposed of, the powers of argument
      that had been thought fairly able to compete with Norman, and which had
      taxed him so severely. She did not know how differently abstract questions
      appear to a mature mind, confirmed in principle by practice; and to one
      young, struggling in self-formation, and more used to theories than to
      realities.

      CHAPTER XII.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     The heart may ache, but may not burst;
     Heaven will not leave thee, nor forsake.
                                     Christian Year.
</pre>
    <p>
      Hector and Tom finished their holidays by a morning&rsquo;s shooting at the
      Grange, Dr. May promising to meet them, and let them drive him home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meta was out when he arrived; and, repairing to the library, he found Mr.
      Rivers sitting by a fire, though it was early in September, with the
      newspaper before him, but not reading. He looked depressed, and seemed
      much disappointed at having heard that George and Flora had accepted some
      further invitations in Scotland, and did not intend to return for another
      month. Dr. May spoke cheerfully of the hospitality and kindness they had
      met, but failed to enliven him, and, as if trying to assign some cause for
      his vexation, he lamented over fogs and frosts, and began to dread an
      October in Scotland for Flora, almost as if it were the Arctic regions.
    </p>
    <p>
      He grew somewhat more animated in praising Flora, and speaking of the
      great satisfaction he had in seeing his son married to so admirable a
      person. He only wished it could be the same with his daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a very unselfish father,&rdquo; said Dr. May. &ldquo;I cannot imagine you
      without your little fairy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be hard to part,&rdquo; said Mr. Rivers, sighing; &ldquo;yet I should be
      relieved to see her in good hands, so pretty and engaging as she is, and
      something of an heiress. With our dear Flora, she is secure of a happy
      home when I am gone, but still I should be glad to have seen&mdash;&rdquo; and
      he broke off thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is so sensible, that we shall see her make a good choice,&rdquo; said Dr.
      May, smiling; &ldquo;that is, if she choose at all, for I do not know who is
      worthy of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am quite indifferent as to fortune,&rdquo; continued Mr. Rivers. &ldquo;She will
      have enough of her own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough not to be dependent, which is the point,&rdquo; said Dr. May, &ldquo;though I
      should have few fears for her any way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be a comfort,&rdquo; harped on Mr. Rivers, dwelling on the subject, as
      if he wanted to say something, &ldquo;if she were only safe with a man who knew
      how to value her and make her happy. Such a young man as your Norman, now&mdash;I
      have often thought&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. May would not seem to hear, but he could not prevent himself from
      blushing as crimson as if he had been the very Norman, as he answered,
      going on with his own speech, as if Mr. Rivers&rsquo;s had been unmade, &ldquo;She is
      the brightest little creature under the sun, and the sparkle is down so
      deep within, that however it may turn out, I should never fear for her
      happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flora is my great reliance,&rdquo; proceeded Mr. Rivers. &ldquo;Her aunt, Lady
      Leonora, is very kind, but somehow she does not seem to suit with Meta.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, ho,&rdquo; thought the doctor, &ldquo;have you made that discovery, my good
      friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The voices of the two boys were heard in the hall, explaining their
      achievements to Meta, and Dr. May took his departure, Hector driving him,
      and embarking in a long discourse on his own affairs as if he had quite
      forgotten that the doctor was not his father, and going on emphatically,
      in spite of the absence of mind now and then betrayed by his auditor, who,
      at Dr. Spencer&rsquo;s door, exclaimed, &ldquo;Stop, Hector, let me out here&mdash;thank
      you;&rdquo; and presently brought out his friend into the garden, and sat down
      on the grass, talking low and earnestly over the disease with which Mr.
      Rivers had been so long affected; for though Dr. May could not perceive
      any positively unfavourable symptom, he had been rendered vaguely uneasy
      by the unusual heaviness and depression of manner. So long did they sit
      conversing, that Blanche was sent out, primed with an impertinent message,
      that two such old doctors ought to be ashamed of themselves for sitting so
      late in the dew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Spencer was dragged in to drink tea, and the meal had just been
      merrily concluded, when the door bell rang, and a message was brought in.
      &ldquo;The carriage from the Grange, sir; Miss Rivers would be much obliged if
      you would come directly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; said Dr. May, looking at Dr. Spencer, as if to say, I told you
      so, in the first triumph of professional sagacity; but the next moment
      exclaiming, &ldquo;Poor little Meta!&rdquo; he hurried away.
    </p>
    <p>
      A gloom fell on those who remained, for, besides their sympathy for Meta,
      and their liking for her kind old father, there was that one
      unacknowledged heartache, which, though in general bravely combated, lay
      in wait always ready to prey on them. Hector stole round to sit by
      Margaret, and Dr. Spencer muttered, &ldquo;This will never do,&rdquo; and sent Tom to
      fetch some papers lying on his table, whence he read them some curious
      accounts that he had just received from his missionary friends in India.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were interested, but in a listening mood, that caused a universal
      start when the bell again sounded. This time, James reported that the
      servant from the Grange said his master was very ill&mdash;he had brought
      a letter to post for Mr. George Rivers, and here was a note for Miss
      Ethel. It was the only note Ethel had ever received from her father, and
      contained these few words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR E.&mdash;,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe this attack will be the last. Come to Meta, and bring my
      things. R. M.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel put her hands to her forehead. It was as if she had been again
      plunged into the stunned dream of misery of four years ago, and her
      sensation was of equal bewilderment and uselessness; but it was but for a
      moment&mdash;the next she was in a state of over-bustle and eagerness. She
      wanted to fly about and hasten to help Meta, and could hardly obey the
      word and gesture by which Margaret summoned her to her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Ethel, you must calm yourself, or you will not be of use.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? I can&rsquo;t be of any use! Oh, if you could go! If Flora were but here!
      But I must go, Margaret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will put up your father&rsquo;s things,&rdquo; said Dr. Spencer, in a soothing
      tone. &ldquo;The carriage cannot be ready in a moment, so that there will be
      full time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary and Miss Bracy prepared Ethel&rsquo;s own goods, which she would otherwise
      have forgotten; and Margaret, meanwhile, detained her by her side, trying
      to calm and encourage her with gentle words of counsel, that might hinder
      her from giving way to the flurry of emotion that had seized her, and
      prevent her from thinking herself certain to be useless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adams was to drive her thither in the gig, and it presently came to the
      door. Dr. Spencer wrapped her up well in cloaks and shawls, and spoke
      words of kindly cheer in her ear as she set off. The fresh night air blew
      pleasantly on her, the stars glimmered in full glory overhead, and now and
      then her eye was caught by the rocket-like track of a shooting-star. Orion
      was rising slowly far in the east, and bringing to her mind the sailor-boy
      under the southern sky; if, indeed, he were not where sun and stars no
      more are the light. It was strange that the thought came more as soothing
      than as acute pain; she could bear to think of him thus in her present
      frame, as long as she had not to talk of him. Under those solemn stars,
      the life everlasting seemed to overpower the sense of this mortal life,
      and Ethel&rsquo;s agitation was calmed away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old cedar-tree stood up in stately blackness against the sky, and the
      lights in the house glanced behind it. The servants looked rather
      surprised to see Ethel, as if she were not expected, and conducted her to
      the great drawing-room, which looked the more desolate and solitary, from
      the glare of lamplight, falling on the empty seats which Ethel had lately
      seen filled with a glad home party. She was looking round, thinking
      whether to venture up to Meta&rsquo;s room, and there summon Bellairs, when Meta
      came gliding in, and threw her arms round her. Ethel could not speak, but
      Meta&rsquo;s voice was more cheerful than she had expected. &ldquo;How kind of you,
      dear Ethel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa sent for me,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is so kind! Can Margaret spare you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; but you must leave me. You must want to be with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He never lets me come in when he has these attacks,&rdquo; said Meta. &ldquo;If he
      only would! But will you come up to my room? That is nearer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is papa with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meta wound her arms round Ethel, and led her up to her sitting-room, where
      a book lay on the table. She said that her father had seemed weary and
      torpid, and had sat still until almost their late dinner-hour, when he
      seemed to bethink himself of dressing, and had risen. She thought he
      walked weakly, and rather tottering, and had run to make him lean on her,
      which he did, as far as his own room door. There he had kissed her, and
      thanked her, and murmured a word like blessing. She had not, however, been
      alarmed, until his servant had come to tell her that he had another
      seizure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel asked whether she had seen Dr. May since he had been with her
      father. She had; but Ethel was surprised to find that she had not taken in
      the extent of his fears. She had become so far accustomed to these
      attacks, that, though anxious and distressed, she did not apprehend more
      than a few days&rsquo; weakness, and her chief longing was to be of use. She was
      speaking cheerfully of beginning her nursing to-morrow, and of her great
      desire that her papa would allow her to sit up with him, when there was a
      slow, reluctant movement of the lock of the door, and the two girls sprang
      to their feet, as Dr. May opened it; and Ethel read his countenance at
      once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not so Meta. &ldquo;How is he? May I go to him?&rdquo; cried she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not now, my dear,&rdquo; said Dr. May, putting his hand on her shoulder, in a
      gentle, detaining manner, that sent a thrill of trembling through her
      frame, though she did not otherwise move. She only clasped her hands
      together, and looked up into his face. He answered the look. &ldquo;Yes, my
      dear, the struggle is over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel came near, and put her arm round Meta&rsquo;s waist, as if to strengthen
      her, as she stood quite passive and still.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. May seemed to think it best that all should be told; but, though
      intently watching Meta, he directed his words to his own daughter. &ldquo;Thank
      Heaven, it has been shorter, and less painful, than I had dared to hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meta tried to speak, but could not bring out the words, and, with an
      imploring look at Ethel, as if to beg her to make them clear for her, she
      inarticulately murmured, &ldquo;Oh! why did you not call me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not. He would not let me. His last conscious word to me was not
      to let you see him suffer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meta wrung her clasped hands together in mute anguish. Dr. May signed to
      Ethel to guide her back to the sofa, but the movement seemed so far to
      rouse her, that she said, &ldquo;I should like to go to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right&mdash;the best thing,&rdquo; said Dr. May; and he whispered to Ethel, &ldquo;Go
      with her, but don&rsquo;t try to rouse her&mdash;don&rsquo;t talk to her. Come back to
      me, presently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not even shake hands with Meta, nor wish her good-night, as she
      disappeared into her own room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bellairs undressed her, and Ethel stood watching, till the young head,
      under the load of sorrow, so new to it, was laid on the pillow. Bellairs
      asked her if she would have a light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, thank you&mdash;the dark and alone. Good-night,&rdquo; said Meta. Ethel
      went back to the sitting-room, where her father was standing at the
      window, looking out into the night. He turned as she came in, folded her
      in his arms, and kissed her forehead. &ldquo;And how is the poor little dear?&rdquo;
       he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear to leave her alone, and to have said
      nothing to comfort her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is too soon as yet,&rdquo; said Dr. May&mdash;&ldquo;her mind has not taken it in.
      I hope she will sleep all night, and have more strength to look at it when
      she wakens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was utterly unprepared.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not make her understand me,&rdquo; said Dr. May.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, oh, papa, what a pity she was not there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was no sight for her, till the last few minutes; and his whole mind
      seemed bent on sparing her. What tenderness it has been.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must we leave her to herself all night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better so,&rdquo; said Dr. May. &ldquo;She has been used to loneliness; and to thrust
      companionship on her would be only harassing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel, who scarcely knew what it was to be alone, looked as if she did not
      understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I used to try to force consolation on people,&rdquo; said Dr. May, &ldquo;but I know,
      now, that it can only be done by following their bent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have seen so many sorrows,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never understood till I felt,&rdquo; said Dr. May. &ldquo;Those few first days were
      a lesson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not think you knew what was passing,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doubt whether any part of my life is more distinctly before me than
      those two days,&rdquo; said Dr. May. &ldquo;Flora coming in and out, and poor Alan
      sitting by me; but I don&rsquo;t believe I had any will. I could no more have
      moved my mind than my broken arm; and I verily think, Ethel, that, but for
      that merciful torpor, I should have been frantic. It taught me never to
      disturb grief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what shall we do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must stay with her till Flora comes. I will be here as much as I can.
      She is our charge, till they come home. I told him, between the spasms,
      that I had sent for you, and he seemed pleased.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If only I were anybody else!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. May again threw his arm round her, and looked into her face. He felt
      that he had rather have her, such as she was, than anybody else; and,
      together, they sat down, and talked of what was to be done, and what was
      best for Meta, and of the solemnity of being in the house of death. Ethel
      felt and showed it so much, in her subdued, awe-struck manner, that her
      father felt checked whenever he was about to return to his ordinary
      manner, familiarised, as he necessarily was, with the like scenes. It drew
      him back to the thought of their own trouble, and their conversation
      recurred to those days, so that each gained a more full understanding of
      the other, and they at length separated, certainly with the more peaceful
      and soft feelings for being in the abode of mourning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bellairs promised to call Ethel, to be with her young lady as early as
      might be, reporting that she was sound asleep. And sleep continued to
      shield her till past her usual hour, so that Ethel was up, and had been
      with Dr. May, before she was summoned to her, and then she found her half
      dressed, and hastening that she might not make Dr. May late for breakfast,
      and in going to his patients. There was an elasticity in the happily
      constituted young mind that could not be entirely struck down, nor
      deprived of power of taking thought for others. Yet her eyes looked
      wandering, and unlike themselves, and her words, now and then, faltered,
      as if she was not sure what she was doing or saying. Ethel told her not to
      mind&mdash;Dr. Spencer would take care of the patients; but she did not
      seem to recollect, at first, who Dr. Spencer was, nor to care for being
      reminded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Breakfast was laid out in the little sitting-room. Ethel wanted to take
      the trouble off her hands, but she would not let her. She sat behind her
      urn, and asked about tea or coffee, quite accurately, in a low, subdued
      voice, that nearly overcame Dr. May. When the meal was over, and she had
      rung the bell, and risen up, as if to her daily work, she turned round,
      with that piteous, perplexed air, and stood for a moment, as if confused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cannot we help you?&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Thank you. But, Dr. May, I must not keep you from other
      people&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no one to go to this morning,&rdquo; said Dr. May. &ldquo;I am ready to stay
      with you, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meta came closer to him, and murmured, &ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The breakfast things had, by this time, been taken away, and Meta, looking
      to see that the door had shut for the last time, said, in a low voice,
      &ldquo;Now tell me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. May drew her down to sit on the sofa beside him, and, in his soft,
      sweet voice, told her all that she wished to learn of her father&rsquo;s last
      hours, and was glad to see showers of quiet, wholesome tears drop freely
      down, but without violence, and she scarcely attempted to speak. There was
      a pause at the end, and then she said gently, &ldquo;Thank you, for it all. Dear
      papa!&rdquo; And she rose up, and went back to her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has learned to dwell apart,&rdquo; said Dr. May, much moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How beautiful she bears up!&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has been a life which, as she has used it, has taught her strength and
      self-dependence in the midst of prosperity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;she has trained herself by her dread of
      self-indulgence, and seeking after work. But oh! what a break up it is for
      her! I cannot think how she holds up. Shall I go to her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think not. She knows the way to the only Comforter. I am not afraid of
      her after those blessed tears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. May was right; Meta presently returned to them, in the same gentle
      subdued sadness, enfolding her, indeed, as a flower weighed down by mist,
      but not crushing nor taking away her powers. It was as if she were truly
      upheld; and thankful to her friends as she was, she did not throw herself
      on them in utter dependence or self-abandonment.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wrote needful letters, shedding many tears over them, and often
      obliged to leave off to give the blinding weeping its course, but refusing
      to impose any unnecessary task upon Dr. May&rsquo;s lame arm. All that was
      right, she strove to do; she saw Mr. Charles Wilmot, and was refreshed by
      his reading to her; and when Dr. May desired it, she submissively put on
      her bonnet, and took several turns with Ethel in the shrubbery, though it
      made her cry heartily to look into the downstairs rooms. And she lay on
      the sofa at last, owning herself strangely tired, she did not know why,
      and glad that Ethel should read to her. By and by, she went to dress for
      the evening, and came back, full of the tidings that one of the children
      in the village had been badly burned. It occupied her very much&mdash;she
      made Ethel promise to go and see about her to-morrow, and sent Bellairs at
      once with every comfort that she could devise.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the whole, those two days were to Ethel a peaceful and comfortable
      time. She saw more than usual of her father, and had such conversations
      with him as were seldom practicable at home, and that chimed in with the
      unavowed care which hung on their minds; while Meta was a most sweet and
      loving charge, without being a burden, and often saying such beautiful
      things in her affectionate resignation, that Ethel could only admire and
      lay them up in her mind. Dr. May went backwards and forwards, and brought
      good accounts of Margaret and fond messages; he slept at the Grange each
      night, and Meta used to sit in the corner of the sofa and work, or not, as
      best suited her, while she listened to his talk with Ethel, and now and
      then herself joined.
    </p>
    <p>
      George Rivers&rsquo;s absence was a serious inconvenience in all arrangements;
      but his sister dreaded his grief as much as she wished for his return; and
      often were the posts and the journeys reckoned over, without a
      satisfactory conclusion, as to when he could arrive from so remote a part
      of Scotland.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, as the two girls had finished their early dinner, the butler
      brought in word that Mr. Norman May was there. Meta at once begged that he
      would come in, and Ethel went into the hall to meet him. He looked very
      wan, with the dark rings round his eyes a deeper purple than ever, and he
      could hardly find utterance to ask, &ldquo;How is she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As good and sweet as she can be,&rdquo; said Ethel warmly; but no more, for
      Meta herself had come to the dining-room door, and was holding out her
      hand. Norman took it in both his, but could not speak; Meta&rsquo;s own soft
      voice was the first. &ldquo;I thought you would come&mdash;he was so fond of
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor Norman quite gave way, and Meta was the one to speak gentle words of
      soothing. &ldquo;There is so much to be thankful for,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He has been
      spared so much of the suffering Dr. May feared for him; and he was so
      happy about George.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norman made a great effort to recover himself. Ethel asked for Flora and
      George. It appeared that they had been on an excursion when the first
      letter arrived at Glenbracken, and thus had received both together in the
      evening, on their return. George had been greatly overcome, and they had
      wished to set off instantly; but Lady Glenbracken would not hear of
      Flora&rsquo;s travelling night and day, and it had at length been arranged that
      Norman Ogilvie should drive Norman across the country that evening, to
      catch the mail for Edinburgh, and he had been on the road ever since.
      George was following with his wife more slowly, and would be at home
      to-morrow evening. Meantime, he sent full authority to his father-in-law
      to make arrangements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel went to see the burned child, leaving Meta to take her walk in the
      garden under Norman&rsquo;s charge. He waited on her with a sort of distant
      reverence for a form of grief, so unlike what he had dreaded for her, when
      the first shock of the tidings had brought back to him the shattered
      bewildered feelings to which he dared not recur.
    </p>
    <p>
      To dwell on the details was, to her, a comfort, knowing his sympathy and
      the affection there had been between him and her father; nor had they
      parted in such absolute brightness, as to make them unprepared for such a
      meeting as the present. The cloud of suspense was brooding lower and lower
      over the May family, and the need of faith and submission was as great
      with them as with the young orphan herself. Norman said little, but that
      little was so deep and fervent, that after a time Meta could not help
      saying, when Ethel was seen in the distance, and their talk was nearly
      over, &ldquo;Oh, Norman, these things are no mirage!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the world that is the mirage,&rdquo; he answered. Ethel came up, and Dr.
      May also, in good time for the post. He was obliged to become very busy,
      using Norman for his secretary, till he saw his son&rsquo;s eyes so heavy, that
      he remembered the two nights that he had been up, and ordered him to go
      home and go to bed as soon as tea was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I come back to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;yes&mdash;I think you may. No, no,&rdquo; he added, recollecting
      himself, &ldquo;I think you had better not,&rdquo; and he did not relent, though
      Norman looked disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meta had already expressed her belief that her father would be buried at
      the suburban church, where lay her mother; and Dr. May, having been
      desired to seek out the will and open it, found it was so; and fixed the
      day and hour with Meta, who was as submissive and reasonable as possible,
      though much grieved that he thought she could not be present.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel, after going with Meta to her room at night, returned as usual to
      talk matters over with him, and again say how good Meta was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I think Norman&rsquo;s coming did her a great deal of good,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! yes,&rdquo; said the doctor thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She thinks so much of Mr. Rivers having been fond of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;he was. I find, in glancing over the will, which
      was newly made on Flora&rsquo;s marriage, that he has remembered Norman&mdash;left
      him £100 and his portfolio of prints by Raffaelle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he, indeed?&mdash;how very kind, how much Norman will value it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is remarkable,&rdquo; said Dr. May; and then, as if he could not help it,
      told Ethel what Mr. Rivers had said of his wishes with regard to his
      daughter. Ethel blushed and smiled, and looked so much touched and
      delighted, that he grew alarmed and said, &ldquo;You know, Ethel, this must be
      as if it never had been mentioned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! you will not tell Norman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, certainly not, unless I see strong cause. They are very fond of each
      other, certainly, but they don&rsquo;t know, and I don&rsquo;t know, whether it is not
      like brother and sister. I would not have either of them guess at this, or
      feel bound in any way. Why, Ethel, she has thirty thousand pounds, and I
      don&rsquo;t know how much more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thirty thousand!&rdquo; said Ethel, her tone one of astonishment, while his had
      been almost of objection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would open a great prospect,&rdquo; continued Dr. May complacently; &ldquo;with
      Norman&rsquo;s talents, and such a lift as that, he might be one of the first
      men in England, provided he had nerve and hardness enough, which I doubt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He would not care for it,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but the field of usefulness; but what an old fool I am, after all my
      resolutions not to be ambitious for that boy; to be set a-going by such a
      thing as this! Still Norman is something out of the common way. I wonder
      what Spencer thinks of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you never mean them to hear of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they settle it for themselves,&rdquo; said Dr. May, &ldquo;that sanction will come
      in to give double value to mine; or if I should see poor Norman hesitating
      as to the inequality, I might smooth the way; but you see, Ethel, this
      puts us in a most delicate situation towards this pretty little creature.
      What her father wanted was only to guard her from fortune-hunters, and if
      she should marry suitably elsewhere&mdash;why, we will be contented.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I should be,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is the most winning of humming-birds, and what we see of her now,
      gives one double confidence in her. She is so far from the petted,
      helpless girl that he, poor man, would fain have made her! And she has a
      bright, brave temper and elastic spirits that would be the very thing for
      him, poor boy, with that morbid sensitiveness&mdash;he would not hurt her,
      and she would brighten him. It would be a very pretty thing&mdash;but we
      must never think about it again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we can help it,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I am sorry I have put it into your head too. We shall not so easily
      be unconscious now, when they talk about each other in the innocent way
      they do. We have had a lesson against being pleased at match-making!&rdquo; But,
      turning away from the subject, &ldquo;You shall not lose your Cocksmoor income,
      Ethel&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had never thought of that. You have taken no fees here since we have
      been all one family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he has been good enough to leave me £500, and Cocksmoor can have
      the interest, if you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, thank you, papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is only its due, for I suppose that is for attendance. Personally, to
      myself, he has left that beautiful Claude which he knew I admired so much.
      He has been very kind! But, after all, we ought not to be talking of all
      this&mdash;I should not have known it, if I had not been forced to read
      the will. Well, so we are in Flora&rsquo;s house, Ethel! I wonder how poor dear
      little Meta will feel the being a guest here, instead of the mistress. I
      wish that boy were three or four years older! I should like to take her
      straight home with us&mdash;I should like to have her for a daughter. I
      shall always look on her as one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a Daisy!&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk of it!&rdquo; said Dr. May hastily; &ldquo;this is no time for such
      things. After all, I am glad that the funeral is not here&mdash;Flora and
      Meta might be rather overwhelmed with these three incongruous sets of
      relations. By their letters, those Riverses must be quite as queer a lot
      as George&rsquo;s relations. After all, if we have nothing else, Ethel, we have
      the best of it, in regard to such relations as we have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is Lord Cosham,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he is Meta&rsquo;s guardian, as well as her brother; but he could not have
      her to live with him. She must depend upon Flora. But we shall see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel felt confident that Flora would be very kind to her little
      sister-in-law, and yet one of those gleams of doubt crossed her, whether
      Flora would not be somewhat jealous of her own authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late the next evening, the carriage drove to the door, and George and
      Flora appeared in the hall. Their sisters went out to meet them, and
      George folded Meta in his arms, and kissing her again and again, called
      her his poor dear little sister, and wept bitterly, and even violently.
      Flora stood beside Ethel, and said, in a low voice, that poor George felt
      it dreadfully; and then came forward, touched him gently, and told him
      that he must not overset Meta; and, drawing her from him, kissed her, and
      said what a grievous time this had been for her, and how sorry they had
      been to leave her so long, but they knew she was in the best hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I should have been so sorry you had been over-tired. I was quite
      well off,&rdquo; said Meta.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you must look on us as your home,&rdquo; added Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can she?&rdquo; thought Ethel. &ldquo;This is taking possession, and making Meta
      a guest already!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      However, Meta did not seem so to feel it&mdash;she replied by caresses,
      and turned again to her brother. Poor George was by far the most struck
      down of all the mourners, and his whole demeanour gave his new relations a
      much warmer feeling towards him than they could ever have hoped to
      entertain. His gentle refined father had softly impressed his duller
      nature; and his want of attention and many extravagances came back upon
      him acutely now, in his changed home. He could hardly bear to look at his
      little orphan sister, and lavished every mark of fondness upon her; nor
      could he endure to sit at the bottom of his table; but when they had gone
      in to dinner, he turned away from the chair and hid his face. He was
      almost like a child in his want of self-restraint; and with all Dr. May&rsquo;s
      kind soothing manner, he could not bring him to attend to any of the
      necessary questions as to arrangements, and was obliged to refer to Flora,
      whose composed good sense was never at fault.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel was surprised to find that it would be a great distress to Meta to
      part with her until the funeral was over, though she would hardly express
      a wish lest Ethel should be needed at home. As soon as Flora perceived
      this, she begged her sister to stay, and again Ethel felt unpleasantly
      that Meta might have seen, if she had chosen, that Flora took the
      invitation upon herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, while Dr. May, with George, Norman, and Tom, went to London, she
      remained, though not exactly knowing what good she was doing, unless by
      making the numbers rather less scanty; but both sisters declared her to be
      the greatest comfort possible; and when Meta shut herself up in her own
      room, where she had long learned to seek strength in still communing with
      her own heart, Flora seemed to find it a relief to call her sister to
      hers, and talk over ordinary subjects, in a tone that struck on Ethel&rsquo;s
      ear as a little incongruous&mdash;but then Flora had not been here from
      the first, and the impression could not be as strong. She was very kind,
      and her manner, when with others, was perfect, from its complete absence
      of affectation; but, alone with Ethel, there was a little complacency
      sometimes betrayed, and some curiosity whether her father had read the
      will. Ethel allowed what she had heard of the contents to be extracted
      from her, and it certainly did not diminish Flora&rsquo;s secret satisfaction in
      being &lsquo;somebody&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      She told the whole history of her visits; first, how cordial Lady Leonora
      Langdale had been, and then, how happy she had been at Glenbracken. The
      old Lord and Lady, and Marjorie, all equally charming in their various
      ways; and Norman Ogilvie so good a son, and so highly thought of in his
      own country.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I tell you, Ethel, that he desired to be remembered to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you said so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has Coralie done with it?&rdquo; continued Flora, seeking in her
      dressing-case. &ldquo;She must have put it away with my brooches. Oh, no, here
      it is. I had been looking for Cairngorm specimens in a shop, saying I
      wanted a brooch that you would wear, when Norman Ogilvie came riding after
      the carriage, looking quite hot and eager. He had been to some other
      place, and hunted this one up. Is it not a beauty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was one of the round Bruce brooches, of dark pebble, with a silver
      fern-leaf lying across it, the dots of small Cairngorm stones. &ldquo;The
      Glenbracken badge, you know,&rdquo; continued Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel twisted it about in her fingers, and said, &ldquo;Was not it meant for
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was to oblige me, if you choose so to regard it,&rdquo; said Flora, smiling.
      &ldquo;He gave me no injunctions; but, you see, you must wear it now. I shall
      not wear coloured brooches for a year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel sighed. She felt as if her black dress ought, perhaps, to be worn
      for a nearer cause. She had a great desire to keep that Glenbracken
      brooch; and surely it could not be wrong. To refuse it would be much
      worse, and would only lead to Flora&rsquo;s keeping it, and not caring for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it is your present, Flora?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you like better to call it so, my dear. I find Norman Ogilvie is going
      abroad in a few months. I think we ought to ask him here on his way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flora, I wish you would not talk about such things!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really and truly, Ethel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not, at such a time as this,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora was checked a little, and sat down to write to Marjorie Ogilvie.
      &ldquo;Shall I say you like the brooch, Ethel?&rdquo; she asked presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say what is proper,&rdquo; said Ethel impatiently. &ldquo;You know what I mean, in
      the fullest sense of the word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I?&rdquo; said Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;that you may say, simply and rationally, that I
      like the thing, but I won&rsquo;t have it said as a message, or that I take it
      as his present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Flora, &ldquo;the whole affair is simple enough, if you would
      not be so conscious, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flora, I can&rsquo;t stand your calling me my dear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very much obliged to you,&rdquo; said Flora, laughing, more than she would
      have liked to be seen, but recalled by her sister&rsquo;s look. Ethel was sorry
      at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flora, I beg your pardon; I did not mean to be cross, only please don&rsquo;t
      begin about that; indeed, I think you had better leave out about the
      brooch altogether. No one will wonder at your passing it over in such a
      return as this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; said Flora thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel carried the brooch to her own room, and tried to keep herself from
      speculating what had been Mr. Ogllvie&rsquo;s views in procuring it, and whether
      he remembered showing her, at Woodstock, which sort of fern was his badge,
      and how she had abstained from preserving the piece shut up in her
      guide-book.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meta&rsquo;s patient sorrow was the best remedy for proneness to such musings.
      How happy poor little Meta had been! The three sisters sat together that
      long day, and Ethel read to the others, and by and by went to walk in the
      garden with them, till, as Flora was going in, Meta asked, &ldquo;Do you think
      it would be wrong for me to cross the park to see that little burned girl,
      as Mr. Wilmot is away to-day, and she has no one to go to her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flora could see no reason against it, and Meta and Ethel left the garden,
      and traversed the green park, in its quiet home beauty, not talking much,
      except that Meta said, &ldquo;Well! I think there is quite as much sweetness as
      sadness in this evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because of this calm autumn sunset beauty?&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;Look at the
      golden light coming in under the branches of the trees.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Meta, &ldquo;one cannot help thinking how much more beautiful it
      must be&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two girls said no more, and came to the cottage, where so much
      gratitude was expressed at seeing Miss Rivers, that it was almost too much
      for her. She left Ethel to talk, and only said a few soft little words to
      her sick scholar, who seemed to want her voice and smile to convince her
      that the small mournful face, under all that black crape, belonged to her
      own dear bright teacher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is odd,&rdquo; said Meta, as they went back; &ldquo;it is seeing other people that
      makes one know it is all sad and altered&mdash;it seems so bewildering,
      though they are so kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what you mean,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One ought not to wish it to go on, because there are other people and
      other duties,&rdquo; said Meta, &ldquo;but quietness is so peaceful. Do you know,
      Ethel, I shall always think of those two first days, before anybody came,
      with you and Dr. May, as something very&mdash;very&mdash;precious,&rdquo; she
      said at last, with the tears rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure I shall,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how it is, but there is something even in this affliction
      that makes it like&mdash;a strange sort of happiness,&rdquo; said Meta musingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what it is!&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That He is so very good?&rdquo; said Meta reverently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ethel, almost rebuked for the first thought, namely, that it
      was because Meta was so very good.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does make one feel more confidence,&rdquo; said Meta.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It is good for me to have been in trouble,&rsquo;&rdquo; repeated Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Meta. &ldquo;I hope it is not wrong or unkind in me to feel it, for
      I think dear papa would wish it; but I do not feel as if&mdash;miss him
      always as I shall&mdash;the spring of life were gone from me. I don&rsquo;t
      think it can, for I know no more pain or trouble can reach him, and there
      is&mdash;don&rsquo;t you think, Ethel, that I may think so?&mdash;especial care
      for the orphan, like a compensation. And there is hope, and work here. And
      I am very thankful! How much worse it would have been, if George had not
      been married! Dear Flora! Will you tell her, Ethel, how really I do wish
      her to take the command of me? Tell her it will be the greatest kindness
      in the world to make me useful to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And please tell her that I am afraid I may forget, and take upon me, as
      if I were still lady of the house. Tell her I do not mean it, and I hope
      that she will check it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think there is no fear of her forgetting that,&rdquo; said Ethel, regretting
      the words before they were out of her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope I shall not,&rdquo; said Meta. &ldquo;If I do, I shall drive myself away to
      stay with Aunt Leonora, and I don&rsquo;t want to do that at all. So please to
      make Flora understand that she is head, and I am ready to be hand and
      foot;&rdquo; and Meta&rsquo;s bright smile shone out, with the pleasure of a fresh and
      loving service.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel understood the force of her father&rsquo;s words, that it was a brave,
      vigorous spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. May came back with George, and stayed to dinner, after which he talked
      over business with Flora, whose sagacity continually amazed him, and who
      undertook to make her husband understand, and do what was needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meta meanwhile cross-questioned her brother on the pretty village by the
      Thames, of which she had a fond, childish remembrance, and heard from him
      of the numerous kind messages from all her relations. There were various
      invitations, but George repeated them unwillingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t go, Meta,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It would be a horrid nuisance to part with
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As long as you think so, dear George. When I am in your way, or Flora&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will never be! I say, Flora, will she ever be in our way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed! Meta and I understand that,&rdquo; said Flora, looking up. &ldquo;Well, I
      suppose Bruce can&rsquo;t be trusted to value the books and prints.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. May thought it a great relief that Meta had a home with Flora, for, as
      he said to Ethel as they went home together, &ldquo;Certainly, except Lord
      Cosham, I never saw such an unpresentable crew as their relations. You
      should have heard the boys afterwards! There was Master Tom turning up his
      Eton nose at them, and pronouncing that there never were such a set of
      snobs, and Norman taking him to task as I never heard him do before&mdash;telling
      him that he would never have urged his going to Eton, if he had thought it
      would make him despise respectable folks, probably better than himself,
      and that this was the last time in the world for such observations&mdash;whereat
      poor Tommy was quite annihilated; for a word from Norman goes further with
      him than a lecture from any one else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I think Norman was right as to the unfitness of the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he was. But we had a good deal of them, waiting in the inn parlour.
      People make incongruities when they will have such things done in state.
      It could not be helped here, to be sure; but I always feel, at a grand
      undertaker&rsquo;s display like this, that, except the service itself, there is
      little to give peace or soothing. I hate what makes a talk! Better be
      little folk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One would rather think of our own dear cloister, and those who cared so
      much,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you were happy to be there!&rdquo; said Dr. May. &ldquo;But it all comes to the
      same.&rdquo; Pausing, he looked from the window, then signed to Ethel to do the
      same&mdash;Orion glittered in the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One may sleep sound without the lullaby,&rdquo; said Dr. May, &ldquo;and the waves&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! don&rsquo;t, papa. You don&rsquo;t give up hope!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe we ought, Ethel. Don&rsquo;t tell her, but I went to the Admirality
      to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what did you hear there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great cause for fear&mdash;but they do not give up. My poor Margaret! But
      those stars tell us they are in the same Hand.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XIII.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Shall I sit alone in my chamber,
       And set the chairs by the wall,
     While you sit with lords and princes,
       Yet have not a thought at all?

     Shall I sit alone in my chamber,
       And duly the table lay,
     Whilst you stand up in the diet,
       And have not a word to say?&mdash;Old Danish Ballad.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Norman, are you come already?&rdquo; exclaimed Margaret, as her brother
      opened the door, bringing in with him the crisp breath of December.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I came away directly after collections. How are you, Margaret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty brave, thank you;&rdquo; but the brother and sister both read on each
      other&rsquo;s features that the additional three months of suspense had told.
      There were traces of toil and study on Norman&rsquo;s brow; the sunken look
      about his eyes, and the dejected outline of his cheek, Margaret knew
      betokened discouragement; and though her mild serenity was not changed,
      she was almost transparently thin and pale. They had long ago left off
      asking whether there were tidings, and seldom was the subject adverted to,
      though the whole family seemed to be living beneath a dark shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is Flora?&rdquo; he next asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going on beautifully, except that papa thinks she does too much in every
      way. She declares that she shall bring the baby to show me in another
      week, but I don&rsquo;t think it will be allowed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the little lady prospers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Capitally, though I get rather contradictory reports of her. First, papa
      declared her something surpassing&mdash;exactly like Flora, and so I
      suppose she is; but Ethel and Meta will say nothing for her beauty, and
      Blanche calls her a fright. But papa is her devoted admirer&mdash;he does
      so enjoy having a sort of property again in a baby!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And George Rivers?&rdquo; said Norman, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor George! he is very proud of her in his own way. He has just been
      here with a note from Flora, and actually talked! Between her and the
      election, he is wonderfully brilliant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The election? Has Mr. Esdaile resigned?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you not heard? He intends it, and George himself is going to stand.
      The only danger is that Sir Henry Walkinghame should think of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rivers in Parliament! Well, sound men are wanted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fancy Flora, our member&rsquo;s wife. How well she will become her position.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How soon is it likely to be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quickly, I fancy. Dr. Spencer, who knows all kinds of news (papa says he
      makes a scientific study of gossip, as a new branch of comparative
      anatomy), found out from the Clevelands that Mr. Esdaile meant to retire,
      and happened to mention it the last time that Flora came to see me. It was
      like firing a train. You would have wondered to see how it excited her,
      who usually shows her feelings so little. She has been so much occupied
      with it, and so anxious that George should be ready to take the field at
      once, that papa was afraid of its hurting her, and Ethel comes home
      declaring that the election is more to her than her baby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ethel is apt to be a little hard on Flora. They are too unlike to
      understand each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ethel is to be godmother though, and Flora means to ask Mr. Ogilvie to
      come and stand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he will be gone abroad, or I should have asked him to fulfil his
      old promise of coming to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe he must be lodged here, if he should come. Flora will have her
      house full, for Lady Leonora is coming. The baby is to be called after
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; exclaimed Norman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I thought it unnecessary, as she is not George&rsquo;s aunt, but Flora is
      grateful to her for much kindness, and she is coming to see Meta. I am
      afraid papa is a little hurt, that any name but one should have been
      chosen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has Meta been comfortable?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear little thing! Every one says how beautifully she has behaved. She
      brought all her housekeeping books to Flora at once, and only begged to be
      made helpful in whatever way might be most convenient. She explained, what
      we never knew before, how she had the young maids in to read with her, and
      asked leave to go on. Very few could have been set aside so simply and
      sweetly in their own house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flora was sensible of it, I hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes. She took the management of course, but Meta is charmed with her
      having the girls in from the village, in turn, to help in the scullery.
      They have begun family prayers too, and George makes the stablemen go to
      church&mdash;a matter which had been past Meta, as you may guess, though
      she had been a wonderful little manager, and Flora owned herself quite
      astonished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder only at her being astonished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meta owned to Ethel that what had been worst of all to her was the heart
      sinking, at finding herself able to choose her occupations, with no one to
      accommodate them to. But she would not give way&mdash;she set up more work
      for herself at the school, and has been talking of giving singing lessons
      at Cocksmoor; and she forced herself to read, though it was an effort. She
      has been very happy lately in nursing Flora.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Ethel there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; she is, as usual, at Cocksmoor. There are great councils about
      sending Cherry to be trained for her new school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would Flora be able to see me, if I were to ride over to the Grange?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may try; and, if papa is not there, I dare say she will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least, I shall see Meta, and she may judge. I want to see Rivers too,
      so I will ask if the bay is to be had. Ah! you have the Claude, I see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is too large for this room; but papa put it here that I might
      enjoy it, and it is almost a companion. The sky improves so in the sunset
      light.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norman was soon at Abbotstoke; and, as he drew his rein, Meta&rsquo;s bright
      face nodded to him from Flora&rsquo;s sitting-room window; and, as he passed the
      conservatory, the little person met him, with a summons, at once, to his
      sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found Flora on the sofa, with a table beside her, covered with notes
      and papers. She was sitting up writing; and, though somewhat pale, was
      very smiling and animated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Norman, how kind to come to me the first thing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Margaret encouraged me to try whether you would be visible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They want to make a regular prisoner of me,&rdquo; said Flora, laughing. &ldquo;Papa
      is as bad as the old nurse! But he has not been here to-day, so I have had
      my own way. Did you meet George?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but Margaret said he had been with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish he would come. We expect the second post to bring the news that
      Mr. Esdaile has accepted the Chiltern Hundreds. If he found it so, he
      meant to go and talk to Mr. Bramshaw; for, though he is so dull, we must
      make him agent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there any danger of opposition?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None at all, if we are soon enough in the field. Papa&rsquo;s name will secure
      us, and there is no one else on the right side to come forward, so that it
      is an absolute rescue of the seat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the very moment when men of principle are most wanted,&rdquo; said
      Norman. &ldquo;The questions of the day are no light matters; and it is an
      immense point to save Stoneborough from being represented by one of the
      Tomkins&rsquo; set.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly so,&rdquo; said Flora. &ldquo;I should feel it a crime to say one word to
      deter George, at a time when every effort must be made to support the
      right cause. One must make sacrifices when the highest interests are at
      stake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flora seemed to thrive upon her sacrifice&mdash;she had never appeared
      more brilliant and joyous. Her brother saw, in her, a Roman matron; and
      the ambition that was inherent in his nature, began to find compensation
      for being crushed, as far as regarded himself, by soaring for another. He
      eagerly answered that he fully agreed with her, and that she would never
      repent urging her husband to take on himself the duties incumbent on all
      who had the power.
    </p>
    <p>
      Highly gratified, she asked him to look at a copy of George&rsquo;s intended
      address, which was lying on the table. He approved of the tenor, but saw a
      few phrases susceptible of a better point. &ldquo;Give it,&rdquo; she said, putting a
      pen into his hand; and he began to interline and erase her fair
      manuscript, talking earnestly, and working up himself and the address at
      the same time, till it had grown into a composition far superior to the
      merely sensible affair it had been. Eloquence and thought were now in the
      language, and substance&mdash;and Flora was delighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been very disrespectful to my niece all this time,&rdquo; said Norman,
      descending from the clouds of patriotism.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not mean to inflict her mercilessly on her relations,&rdquo; said Flora,
      &ldquo;but I should like you to see her. She is so like Blanche.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little girl was brought in, and Flora made a very pretty young mother,
      as she held her in her arms, with so much graceful pride. Norman was
      perfectly entranced&mdash;he had never seen his sister so charming or so
      admirable, between her delight in her infant, and her self-devotion to the
      good of her husband and her country&mdash;acting so wisely, and speaking
      so considerately; and praising her dear Meta with so much warmth. He would
      never have torn himself away, had not the nurse hinted that Mrs. Rivers
      had had too much excitement and fatigue already to-day; and, besides, he
      suspected that he might find Meta in the drawing-room, where he might
      discuss the whole with her, and judge for himself of her state of spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora&rsquo;s next visitor was her father, who came as the twilight was
      enhancing the comfortable red brightness of the fire. He was very happy in
      these visits&mdash;mother and child had both prospered so well, and it was
      quite a treat to be able to expend his tenderness on Flora. His little
      grandchild seemed to renew his own happy days, and he delighted to take
      her from her mother and fondle her. No sooner was the baby in his arms
      than Flora&rsquo;s hands were busy among the papers, and she begged him to ring
      for lights.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t you sit in the dark, and give yourself a
      little rest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to hear George&rsquo;s address. Norman has been looking at it, and I
      hope you will not think it too strong,&rdquo; and she turned, so that the light
      might fall on the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; said Dr. May, holding out his hand for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a rough copy, too much scratched for you to make out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She read it accordingly, and her father admired it exceedingly&mdash;Norman&rsquo;s
      touches, above all; and Flora&rsquo;s reading had dovetailed all so neatly
      together that no one knew where the joins were. &ldquo;I will copy it fairly,&rdquo;
       she said, &ldquo;if you will show it to Dr. Spencer, and ask whether he thinks
      it too strong. Mr. Dodsley too; he would be more gratified if he saw it
      first, in private, and thought himself consulted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. May was dismayed at seeing her take up her pen, make a desk of her
      blotting-book, and begin her copy by firelight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flora, my dear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this must not be. Have I not told you that you
      must be content to rest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not get up till ten o&rsquo;clock, and have been lying here ever since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what has this head of yours been doing? Has it been resting for ten
      minutes together? Now I know what I am saying, Flora&mdash;I warn you,
      that if you will not give yourself needful quiet now, you will suffer for
      it by and by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flora smiled, and said, &ldquo;I thought I had been very good. But, what is to
      be done when one&rsquo;s wits will work, and there is work for them to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is not there work enough for them here?&rdquo; said Dr. May, looking at the
      babe. &ldquo;Your mother used to value such a retirement from care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flora was silent for a minute, then said, &ldquo;Mr. Esdaile should have put off
      his resignation to suit me. It is an unfortunate time for the election.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you can&rsquo;t let the election alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head, and smiled a negative, as if she would, but that she
      was under a necessity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, if the election cannot go on without you, it had better not go
      on at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked very much hurt, and turned away her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father was grieved. &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I know you desire to be of
      use, especially to George; but do you not believe that he would rather
      fail, than that you, or his child, should suffer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he stand by his own wish, or yours, Flora?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wishes it. It is his duty,&rdquo; said Flora, collecting her dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can say no more, except to beg him not to let you exert yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, when George came home, the doctor read him a lecture on his
      wife&rsquo;s over-busy brain; and was listened to, as usual, with gratitude and
      deference. He professed that he only wished to do what was best for her,
      but she never would spare herself; and, going to her side, with his heavy,
      fond solicitude, he made her promise not to hurt herself, and she laughed
      and consented.
    </p>
    <p>
      The promise was easily given, for she did not believe she was hurting
      herself; and, as to giving up the election, or ceasing secretly to prompt
      George, that was absolutely out of the question. What could be a greater
      duty than to incite her husband to usefulness?
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover it was but proper to invite Meta&rsquo;s aunt and cousin to see her,
      and to project a few select dinners for their amusement and the
      gratification of her neighbours. It was only grateful and cousinly
      likewise, to ask the &ldquo;Master of Glenbracken&rdquo;; and as she saw the thrill of
      colour on Ethel&rsquo;s cheeks, at the sight of the address to the Honourable
      Norman Ogilvie, she thought herself the best of sisters. She even talked
      of Ogilvie as a second Christian name, but Meta observed that old Aunt
      Dorothy would call it Leonorar Rogilvie Rivers, and thus averted it,
      somewhat to Ethel&rsquo;s satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel scolded herself many times for wondering whether Mr. Ogilvie would
      come. What was it to her? Suppose he should; suppose the rest. What a
      predicament! How unreasonable and conceited, even to think of such a
      thing, when her mind was made up. What could result, save tossings to and
      fro, a passing gratification set against infinite pain, and strife with
      her own heart and with her father&rsquo;s unselfishness! Had he but come before
      Flora&rsquo;s marriage! No; Ethel hated herself for the wish that arose for the
      moment. Far better he should keep away, if, perhaps, without the slightest
      inclination towards her, his mere name could stir up such a tumult&mdash;all,
      it might be, founded in vanity. Rebellious feelings and sense of tedium
      had once been subdued&mdash;why should they be roused again?
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer came. Norman Ogilvie was setting off for Italy, and regretted
      that he could not take Abbotstoke on his way. He desired his kind
      remembrances and warm Christmas wishes to all his cousins.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Ethel breathed more freely, there was a sense that tranquillity is
      uninteresting. It was, it must be confessed, a flat end to a romance, that
      all the permanent present effect was a certain softening, and a degree
      more attention to her appearance; and after all, this might, as Flora
      averred, be ascribed to the Paris outfit having taught her to wear
      clothes; as well as to that which had awakened the feminine element, and
      removed that sense of not being like other women, which sometimes hangs
      painfully about girls who have learned to think themselves plain or
      awkward.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were other causes why it should be a dreary winter to Ethel, under
      the anxiety that strengthened by duration, and the strain of acting
      cheerfulness for Margaret&rsquo;s sake. Even Mary was a care. Her round rosy
      childhood had worn into height and sallowness, and her languor and
      indifference fretted Miss Bracy, and was hunted down by Ethel, till
      Margaret convinced her that it was a case for patience and tenderness,
      which, thenceforth, she heartily gave, even encountering a scene with Miss
      Bracy, who was much injured by the suggestion that Mary was oppressed by
      perspective. Poor Mary, no one guessed the tears nightly shed over Harry&rsquo;s
      photograph.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor could Ethel quite fathom Norman. He wore the dispirited, burdened
      expression that she knew too well, but he would not, as formerly, seek
      relief in confidence to her, shunning the being alone with her, and far
      too much occupied to offer to walk to Cocksmoor. When the intelligence
      came that good old Mr. Wilmot of Settlesham had peacefully gone to his
      rest, after a short and painless illness, Tom was a good deal affected, in
      his peculiar silent and ungracious fashion; but Norman did not seek to
      talk over the event, and the feelings he had entertained two years ago&mdash;he
      avoided the subject, and threw himself into the election matters with an
      excitement foreign to his nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was almost always at Abbotstoke, or attending George Rivers at the
      committee-room at the Swan, talking, writing, or consulting, concocting
      squibs, and perpetrating bons mots, that were the delight of friends and
      the confusion of foes. Flora was delighted, George adored him, Meta&rsquo;s eyes
      danced whenever he came near, Dr. Spencer admired him, and Dr. Hoxton
      prophesied great things of him; but Ethel did not feel as if he were the
      veritable Norman, and had an undefined sensation of discomfort, when she
      heard his brilliant repartees, and the laughter with which he accompanied
      them, so unlike his natural rare and noiseless laugh. She knew it was
      false excitement, to drive away the suspense that none dared to avow, but
      which did not press on them the less heavily for being endured in silence.
      Indeed, Dr. May could not help now and then giving way to outbursts of
      despondency, of which his friend, Dr. Spencer, who made it his special
      charge to try to lighten his troubles, was usually the kind recipient.
    </p>
    <p>
      And though the bustle of the election was incongruous, and seemed to make
      the leaden weight the more heavy, there was a compensation in the tone of
      feeling that it elicited, which gave real and heartfelt pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. May had undergone numerous fluctuations of popularity. He had always
      been the same man, excellent in intention, though hasty in action, and
      heeding neither praise nor censure; and while the main tenor of his course
      never varied, making many deviations by flying to the reverse of the
      wrong, most immediately before him, still his personal character gained
      esteem every year; and though sometimes his merits, and sometimes his
      failings, gave violent umbrage, he had steadily risen in the estimation of
      his fellow-townsmen, as much as his own inconsistencies and theirs would
      allow, and every now and then was the favourite with all, save with the
      few who abused him for tyranny, because he prevented them from
      tyrannising.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was just now on the top of the wave, and his son-in-law had nothing to
      do but to float in on the tide of his favour. The opposite faction
      attempted a contest, but only rendered the triumph more complete, and gave
      the gentlemen the pleasure of canvassing, and hearing, times without
      number, that the constituents only wished the candidate were Dr. May
      himself. His sons and daughters were full of exultation&mdash;Dr. Spencer,
      much struck, rallied &ldquo;Dick&rdquo; on his influence&mdash;and Dr. May, the drops
      of warm emotion trembling on his eyelashes, smiled, and bade his friend
      see him making a church-rate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The addresses and letters that came from the Grange were so admirable,
      that Dr. May often embraced Norman&rsquo;s steady opinion that George was a very
      wise man. If Norman was unconscious how much he contributed to these
      compositions, he knew far less how much was Flora&rsquo;s. In his ardour, he
      crammed them both, and conducted George when Flora could not be at his
      side. George himself was a personable man, wrote a good bold hand, would
      do as he was desired, and was not easily put out of countenance; he seldom
      committed himself by talking; and when a speech was required, was brief,
      and to the purpose. He made a very good figure, and in the glory of
      victory, Ethel herself began to grow proud of him, and the children&rsquo;s
      great object in life was to make the jackdaws cry, &ldquo;Rivers for ever!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flora had always declared that she would be at Stoneborough for the
      nomination. No one believed her, until three days before, she presented
      herself and her daughter before the astonished Margaret, who was too much
      delighted to be able to scold. She had come away on her own
      responsibility, and was full of triumph. To come home in this manner,
      after having read &ldquo;Rivers for ever!&rdquo; on all the dead walls, might be
      called that for which she had lived. She made no stay&mdash;she had only
      come to show her child, and establish a precedent for driving out, and
      Margaret had begun to believe the apparition a dream, when the others came
      in, some from Cocksmoor, others from the committee-room at the Swan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So she brought the baby,&rdquo; exclaimed Ethel. &ldquo;I should have thought she
      would not have taken her out before her christening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ethel,&rdquo; said Dr. Spencer, &ldquo;permit me to make a suggestion. When relations
      live in the same neighbourhood, there is no phrase to be more avoided than
      &lsquo;I should have thought&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The nomination-day brought Flora, Meta, baby and all to be very quiet, as
      was said; but how could that be? when every boy in the house was frantic,
      and the men scarcely less so. Aubrey and Gertrude, and the two jackdaws,
      each had a huge blue and orange rosette, and the two former went about
      roaring &ldquo;Rivers for ever!&rdquo; without the least consideration for the baby,
      who would have been decked in the same manner, if Ethel would have heard
      of it without indignation, at her wearing any colour before her
      christening white; as to Jack and Jill, though they could say their
      lesson, they were too much distressed by their ornaments to do ought but
      lurk in corners, and strive to peck them off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora comported herself in her usual quiet way, and tried to talk of other
      things, though a carnation spot in each cheek showed her anxiety and
      excitement. She went with her sisters to look out from Dr. Spencer&rsquo;s
      windows towards the Town Hall. Her husband gave her his arm as they went
      down the garden, and Ethel saw her talking earnestly to him, and pressing
      his arm with her other hand to enforce her words, but if she did tutor
      him, it was hardly visible, and he was very glad of whatever counsel she
      gave.
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke not a word after the ladies were left with Aubrey, who was in
      despair at not being allowed to follow Hector and Tom, but was left, as
      his prematurely classical mind expressed it, like the Gaulish women with
      the impedimenta in the marshes&mdash;whereas Tom had added insult to
      injury, by a farewell to &ldquo;Jack among the maidens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meta tried to console him, by persuading him that he was their protector,
      and he began to think there was need of a guard, when a mighty cheer
      caused him to take refuge behind Ethel. Even when assured that it was
      anything but terrific, he gravely declared that he thought Margaret would
      want him, but he could not cross the garden without Meta to protect him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would not allow any one else to relieve her from the doughty champion,
      and thereby she missed the spectacle. It might be that she did not regret
      it, for though it would have been unkind to refuse to come in with her
      brother and sister, her wound was still too fresh for crowds, turmoil, and
      noisy rejoicing to be congenial. She did not withdraw her hand, which
      Aubrey squeezed harder at each resounding shout, nor object to his
      conducting her to see his museum in the dark corner of the attics, most
      remote from the tumult.
    </p>
    <p>
      The loss was not great. The others could hear nothing distinctly, and see
      only a wilderness of heads; but the triumph was complete. Dr. May had been
      cheered enough to satisfy even Hector; George Rivers had made a very fair
      speech, and hurrahs had covered all deficiencies; Hector had shouted till
      he was as hoarse as the jackdaws; the opposite candidate had never come
      forward at all; Tomkins was hiding his diminished head; and the gentlemen
      had nothing to report but success, and were in the highest spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      By and by Blanche was missing, and Ethel, going in quest of her, spied a
      hem of blue merino peeping out under all the cloaks in the hall cupboard,
      and found the poor little girl sobbing in such distress, that it was long
      before any explanation could be extracted, but at last it was revealed&mdash;when
      the door had been shut, and they stood in the dark, half stifled among the
      cloaks, that George&rsquo;s spirits had taken his old facetious style with
      Blanche, and in the very hearing of Hector! The misery of such jokes to a
      sensitive child, conscious of not comprehending their scope, is
      incalculable, and Blanche having been a baby-coquette, was the more
      susceptible. She hid her face again from the very sound of her own
      confession, and resisted Ethel&rsquo;s attempts to draw her out of the musty
      cupboard, declaring that she could never see either of them again. Ethel,
      in vain, assured her that George was gone to the dinner at the Swan;
      nothing was effectual but being told that for her to notice what had
      passed was the sure way to call Hector&rsquo;s attention thereto, when she
      bridled, emerged, and begged to know whether she looked as if she had been
      crying. Poor child, she could never again be unconscious, but, at least,
      she was rendered peculiarly afraid of a style of notice, that might
      otherwise have been a temptation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel privately begged Flora to hint to George to alter his style of wit,
      and the suggestion was received better than the blundering manner
      deserved; Flora was too exulting to take offence, and her patronage of all
      the world was as full-blown as her ladylike nature allowed. Ethel, she did
      not attempt to patronise, but she promised all the sights in London to the
      children, and masters to Mary and Blanche, and she perfectly overwhelmed
      Miss Bracy with orphan asylums for her sisters. She would have liked
      nothing better than dispersing cards, with Mrs. Rivers prominent among the
      recommenders of the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fine coming-out for you, little lady,&rdquo; said she to her baby, when
      taking leave that evening. &ldquo;If it was good luck for you to make your first
      step in life upwards, what is this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excelsior?&rdquo; said Ethel, and Flora smiled, well pleased, but she had not
      caught half the meaning. &ldquo;May it be the right excelsior&rdquo; added Ethel, in a
      low voice that no one heard, and she was glad they did not. They were all
      triumphant, and she could not tell why she had a sense of sadness, and
      thought of Flora&rsquo;s story long ago, of the girl who ascended Mont Blanc,
      and for what?
    </p>
    <p>
      All she had to do at present was to listen to Miss Bracy, who was sure
      that Mrs. Rivers thought Mary and Blanche were not improved, and was
      afraid she was ungrateful for all the intended kindness to her sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel had more sympathy here, for she had thought that Flora was giving
      herself airs, and she laughed and said her sister was pleased to be in a
      position to help her friends; and tried to turn it off, but ended by
      stumbling into allowing that prosperity was apt to make people over-lavish
      of offers of kindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Miss Ethel, you understand so perfectly. There is no one like you!&rdquo;
       cried Miss Bracy, attempting to kiss her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Ethel had not spoken rightly of her sister, she was sufficiently
      punished.
    </p>
    <p>
      What she did was to burst into a laugh, and exclaim, &ldquo;Miss Bracy! Miss
      Bracy! I can&rsquo;t have you sentimental. I am the worst person in the world
      for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have offended. You cannot feel with me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I can, when it is sense; but please don&rsquo;t treat me like a heroine. I
      am sure there is quite enough in the world that is worrying, without
      picking shades of manner to pieces. It is the sure way to make an old crab
      of me, and so I am going off. Only, one parting piece of advice, Miss
      Bracy&mdash;read &lsquo;Frank Fairlegh&rsquo;, and put everybody out of your head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, thinking she had been savage about her hand, Ethel turned back, and
      kissed the little governess&rsquo;s forehead, wished her goodnight, and ran
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had learned that, to be rough and merry, was the best way of doing
      Miss Bracy good in the end; and so she often gave herself the present pain
      of knowing that she was being supposed careless and hard-hearted; but the
      violent affection for her proved that the feeling did not last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel was glad to sit by the fire at bed-time, and think over the day,
      outwardly so gay, inwardly so fretting and perplexing.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the first time that she had seen much of her little niece. She was
      no great baby-handler, nor had she any of the phrases adapted to the
      infant mind; but that pretty little serene blue-eyed girl had been her
      chief thought all day, and she was abashed by recollecting how little she
      had dwelt on her own duties as her sponsor, in the agitations excited by
      the doubts about her coadjutor.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took out her Prayer-book, and read the Service for Baptism,
      recollecting the thoughts that had accompanied her youngest sister&rsquo;s
      orphaned christening, &ldquo;The vain pomp and glory of the world, and all
      covetous desires of the same.&rdquo; They seemed far enough off then, and now&mdash;poor
      little Leonora!
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel knew that she judged her sister hardly; yet she could not help
      picturing to herself the future&mdash;a young lady, trained for
      fashionable life, serious teaching not omitted, but right made the means
      of rising in the world; taught to strive secretly, but not openly, for
      admiration&mdash;a scheming for her marriage&mdash;a career like Flora&rsquo;s
      own. Ethel could scarcely feel that it would not be a mockery to declare,
      on her behalf, that she renounced the world. But, alas! where was not the
      world? Ethel blushed at having censured others, when, so lately, she had
      herself been oblivious of the higher duty. She thought of the prayer,
      including every Christian in holy and loving intercession&mdash;&ldquo;I pray
      not that Thou wouldest take them out of the world, but that Thou wouldest
      keep them from the evil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep her from the evil&mdash;that shall be my prayer for my poor little
      Leonora. His grace can save her, were the surrounding evil far worse than
      ever it is likely to be. The intermixture with good is the trial, and is
      it not so everywhere&mdash;ever since the world and the Church have seemed
      fused together? But she will soon be the child of a Father who guards His
      own; and, at least, I can pray for her, and her dear mother. May I only
      live better, that so I may pray better, and act better, if ever I should
      have to act.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a happy family gathering on the New Year&rsquo;s Day, and Flora, who
      had kindly felt her way with Meta, finding her not yet ready to enjoy a
      public festivity for the village, added a supplement to the Christmas
      beef, that a second dinner might be eaten at home, in honour of Miss
      Leonora Rivers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Leonora was highly satisfied with her visit, which impressed her far
      more in favour of the Abbotstoke neighbourhood than in the days of poor
      old Mr. Rivers. Flora knew every one, and gave little select
      dinner-parties, which, by her good management, even George, at the bottom
      of the table, could not make heavy. Dr. Spencer enjoyed them greatly, and
      was an unfailing resource for conversation; and as to the Hoxtons, Flora
      felt herself amply repaying the kindness she had received in her young
      lady days, when she walked down to the dining-room with the portly
      headmaster, or saw his good lady sit serenely admiring the handsome rooms.
      &ldquo;A very superior person, extremely pleasing and agreeable,&rdquo; was the
      universal verdict on Mrs. Rivers. Lady Leonora struck up a great
      friendship with her, and was delighted that she meant to take Meta to
      London. The only fault that could be found with her was that she had so
      many brothers; and Flora, recollecting that her ladyship mistrusted those
      brothers, avoided encouraging their presence at the Grange, and took every
      precaution against any opening for the suspicion that she threw them in
      the way of her little sister-in-law.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor had Flora forgotten the Ladies&rsquo; Committee, or Cocksmoor. As to the
      muses, they gave no trouble at all. Exemplary civilities about the chair
      passed between the Member&rsquo;s lady and Mrs. Ledwich, ending in Flora&rsquo;s
      insisting that priority in office should prevail, feeling that she could
      well afford to yield the post of honour, since anywhere she was the
      leader. She did not know how much more conformable the ladies had been
      ever since they had known Dr. Spencer&rsquo;s opinion; and yet he only believed
      that they were grateful for good advice, and went about among them, easy,
      good-natured, and utterly unconscious that for him sparkled Mrs. Ledwich&rsquo;s
      bugles, and for him waved every spinster&rsquo;s ribbon, from Miss Rich down to
      Miss Boulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      The point carried by their united influence was Charity Elwood&rsquo;s being
      sent for six months&rsquo; finish at the Diocesan Training School; while a
      favourite pupil-teacher from Abbotstoke took her place at Cocksmoor. Dr.
      Spencer looked at the Training School, and talked Mrs. Ledwich into
      magnanimous forgiveness of Mrs. Elwood. Cherry dreaded the ordeal, but she
      was willing to do anything that was thought right, and likely to make her
      fitter for her office.

      CHAPTER XIV.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &lsquo;Twas a long doubt; we never heard
       Exactly how the ship went down.&mdash;ARCHER GURNEY.
</pre>
    <p>
      The tidings came at last, came when the heart-sickness of hope deferred
      had faded into the worse heart-sickness of fear deferred, and when spirits
      had been fain to rebel, and declare that they would be almost glad to part
      with the hope that but kept alive despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Christmas holidays had come to an end, and the home party were again
      alone, when early in the forenoon, there was a tap at the drawing-room
      door, and Dr. Spencer called, &ldquo;Ethel, can you come and speak to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret started as if those gentle tones had been a thunderclap. &ldquo;Go! go,
      Ethel,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t keep me waiting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Spencer stood in the hall with a newspaper in his hand. Ethel said,
      &ldquo;Is it?&rdquo; and he made a sorrowful gesture. &ldquo;Both?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Both,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;The ship burned&mdash;the boat lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ethel, come!&rdquo; hoarsely called Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take it,&rdquo; said Dr. Spencer, putting the paper into her hand; &ldquo;I will
      wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She obeyed. She could not speak, but kneeling down by her sister, they
      read the paragraph together; Ethel, with one eye on the words, the other
      on Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      No doubt was left. Captain Gordon had returned, and this was his official
      report. The names of the missing stood below, and the list began thus:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        Lieutenant A. H. Ernescliffe.
        Mr. Charles Owen, Mate.
        Mr. Harry May, Midshipman.
</pre>
    <p>
      The Alcestis had taken fire on the 12th of April of the former year. There
      had been much admirable conduct, and the intrepid coolness of Mr.
      Ernescliffe was especially recorded. The boats had been put off without
      loss, but they were scantily provisioned, and the nearest land was far
      distant. For five days the boats kept together, then followed a night of
      storms, and, when morning dawned, the second cutter, under command of Mr.
      Ernescliffe, had disappeared. There could be no doubt that she had sunk,
      and the captain could only record his regrets for the loss the service had
      experienced in the three brave young officers and their gallant seamen.
      After infinite toil and suffering, the captain, with the other boats&rsquo;
      crews, had reached Tahiti, whence they had made their way home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Margaret, Margaret!&rdquo; cried Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret raised herself, and the colour came into her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not write the letter!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What letter?&rdquo; said Ethel, alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard prevented me. The letter that would have parted us. Now all is
      well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All is well, I know, if we could but feel it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He never had the pain. It is unbroken!&rdquo; continued Margaret, her eyes
      brightening, but her breath, in long-drawn gasps that terrified Ethel into
      calling Dr. Spencer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary was standing before him, with bloodless face and dilated eyes; but,
      as Ethel approached, she turned and rushed upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Spencer entered the drawing-room with Ethel, who tried to read his
      face as he saw Margaret&mdash;restored, as it seemed, to all her girlish
      bloom, and her eyes sparkling as they were lifted up, far beyond the
      present scene. Ethel had a moment&rsquo;s sense that his expression was as if he
      had seen a death-blow struck, but it was gone in a moment, as he gently
      shook Margaret by the hand, and spoke a word of greeting, as though to
      recall her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she said, with her own grateful smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is your father?&rdquo; he asked of Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Either at the hospital, or at Mr. Ramsden&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Ethel, with a ghastly
      suspicion that he thought Margaret in a state to require him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa!&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;If he were but here! But&mdash;ah! I had
      forgotten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned aside her head, and hid her face. Dr. Spencer signed Ethel
      nearer to him. &ldquo;This is a more natural state,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid
      for her. I will find your father, and bring him home.&rdquo; Pressing her hand
      he departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret was weeping tranquilly&mdash;Ethel knelt down beside her, without
      daring at first to speak, but sending up intense mental prayers to Him,
      who alone could bear her or her dear father through their affliction. Then
      she ventured to take her hand, and Margaret returned the caress, but began
      to blame herself for the momentary selfishness that had allowed her
      brother&rsquo;s loss and her father&rsquo;s grief to have been forgotten in her own.
      Ethel&rsquo;s &ldquo;oh! no! no!&rdquo; did not console her for this which seemed the most
      present sorrow, but the flow of tears was so gentle, that Ethel trusted
      that they were a relief. Ethel herself seemed only able to watch her, and
      to fear for her father, not to be able to think for herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The front door opened, and they heard Dr. May&rsquo;s step hesitating in the
      hall, as if he could not bear to come in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to him!&rdquo; cried Margaret, wiping off her tears. Ethel stood a moment in
      the doorway, then sprang to him, and was clasped in his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know it?&rdquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Spencer told us. Did not you meet him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I read it at Bramshaw&rsquo;s office. How&mdash;&rdquo; He could not say the
      words, but he looked towards the room, and wrung the hand he held.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quiet. Like herself. Come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He threw one arm round Ethel, and laid his hand on her head. &ldquo;How much
      there is to be thankful for!&rdquo; he said, then advancing, he hung over
      Margaret, calling her his own poor darling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa, you must forgive me. You said sending him to sea was giving him
      up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I. Well, Margaret, he did his duty. That is all we have to live for.
      Our yellow-haired laddie made a gallant sailor, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tears choked his utterance&mdash;Margaret gently stroked his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It falls hard on you, my poor girl,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, papa,&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;I am content and thankful. He is spared pain
      and perplexity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, I believe,&rdquo; said Dr. May. &ldquo;He would have been grieved not
      to find you better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ought to grieve for my own selfishness,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;I cannot help
      it! I cannot be sorry the link is unbroken, and that he had not to turn to
      any one else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He never would!&rdquo; cried Dr. May, almost angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tried to think he ought,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;His life would have been too
      dreary. But it is best as it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;Where are the rest, Ethel? Call them all
      down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor Mary, Ethel felt as if she had neglected her! She found her hanging
      over the nursery fire, alternating with old nurse in fond reminiscences of
      Harry&rsquo;s old days, sometimes almost laughing at his pranks, then crying
      again, while Aubrey sat between them, drinking in each word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blanche and Gertrude came from the schoolroom, where Miss Bracy seemed to
      have been occupying them, with much kindness and judgment. She came to the
      door to ask Ethel anxiously for the doctor and Miss May, and looked so
      affectionate and sympathising, that Ethel gave her a hearty kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Miss Ethel! if you can only let me help you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Ethel with all her heart, and hurried away. Nothing was
      more in favour of Miss Bracy, than that there should be a hurry. Then she
      could be warm, and not morbid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. May gathered his children round him, and took out the great
      Prayer-book. He read a psalm and a prayer from the Burial Service, and the
      sentence for funerals at sea. Then he touched each of their heads, and, in
      short broken sentences, gave thanks for those still left to him, and for
      the blessed hope they could feel for those who were gone; and he prayed
      that they might so follow in their footsteps, as to come to the same holy
      place, and in the meantime realise the Communion of Saints. Then they said
      the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, he blessed them, and they arose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary, my dear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you have a photograph.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She put the case into his hands, and ran away.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to the study, where he found Dr. Spencer awaiting him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am only come to know where I shall go for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Spencer. Thank you for taking care of my poor girls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They took care of themselves. They have the secret of strength.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have&mdash;&rdquo; He turned aside, and burst out, &ldquo;Oh, Spencer! you have
      been spared a great deal. If you missed a great deal of joy, you have
      missed almost as much sorrow!&rdquo; And, covering his face, he let his grief
      have a free course.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dick! dear old Dick, you must bear up. Think what treasures you have
      left.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do. I try to do so,&rdquo; said poor Dr. May; &ldquo;but, Spencer, you never saw my
      yellow-haired laddie, with his lion look! He was the flower of them all!
      Not one of these other boys came near him in manliness, and with such a
      loving heart! An hour ago, I thought any certainty would be gain, but now
      I would give a lifetime to have back the hope that I might see my boy&rsquo;s
      face again! Oh, Spencer! this is the first time I could rejoice that his
      mother is not here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She would have been your comforter,&rdquo; sighed his friend, as he felt his
      inability to contend with such grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, I can be thankful,&rdquo; Dr. May said, and he looked so. &ldquo;She has had
      her brave loving boy with her all this time, while we little thought&mdash;but
      there are others. My poor Margaret&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her patience must be blessed,&rdquo; said Dr. Spencer. &ldquo;I think she will be
      better. Now that the suspense no longer preys on her, there will be more
      rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rest,&rdquo; repeated Dr. May, supporting his head on his hand; and, looking up
      dreamily&mdash;&ldquo;there remaineth a rest&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The large Bible lay beside him on the table, and Dr. Spencer thought that
      he would find more rest there than in his words. Leaving him, therefore,
      his friend went to undertake his day&rsquo;s work, and learn, once more, in the
      anxious inquiries and saddened countenances of the patients and their
      friends, how great an amount of love and sympathy that Dr. May had won by
      his own warmth of heart. The patients seemed to forget their complaints in
      sighs for their kind doctor&rsquo;s troubles; and the gouty Mayor of
      Stoneborough kept Dr. Spencer half an hour to listen to his recollections
      of the bright-faced boy&rsquo;s droll tricks, and then to the praises of the
      whole May family, and especially of the mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Dr. Spencer! he heard her accident described so many times in the
      course of the day, that his visits were one course of shrinking and
      suffering; and his only satisfaction was in knowing how his friend would
      be cheered by hearing of the universal feeling for him and his children.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel wrote letters to her brothers; and Dr. May added a few lines,
      begging Richard to come home, if only for a few days. Margaret would not
      be denied writing to Hector Ernescliffe, though she cried over her letter
      so much that her father could almost have taken her pen away; but she said
      it did her good.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Flora came in the afternoon, Ethel was able to leave Margaret to her,
      and attend to Mary, with whom Miss Bracy&rsquo;s kindness had been
      inefficacious. If she was cheered for a few minutes, some association,
      either with the past or the vanished future, soon set her off sobbing
      again. &ldquo;If I only knew where dear, dear Harry is lying,&rdquo; she sobbed, &ldquo;and
      that it had not been very bad indeed, I could bear it better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The ghastly uncertainty was too terrible for Ethel to have borne to
      contemplate it. She knew that it would haunt their pillows, and she was
      trying to nerve herself by faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that is the worst; but, after all, God willed that we
      should not know. We must bear it like His good children. It makes no
      differences to them now&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Mary, trying to check her sobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, you know, we are all in the same keeping. The sea is a glorious
      great pure thing, you know, that man cannot hurt or defile. It seems to
      me,&rdquo; said Ethel, looking up, &ldquo;as if resting there was like being buried in
      our baptism-tide over again, till the great new birth. It must be the next
      best place to a churchyard. Anywhere, they are as safe as among the
      daisies in our own cloister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say it again&mdash;what you said about the sea,&rdquo; said Mary, more
      comforted than if Ethel had been talking down to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      By and by Ethel discovered that the sharpest trouble to the fond simple
      girl was the deprivation of her precious photograph. It was like losing
      Harry over again, to go to bed without it, though she would not for the
      world seem to grudge it to her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel found an opportunity of telling him of this distress, and it almost
      made him smile. &ldquo;Poor Mary,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is she so fond of it? It is rather
      a libel than a likeness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say so to her, pray, papa. It is all the world to her. Three
      strokes on paper would have been the same, if they had been called by his
      name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; a loving heart has eyes of its own, and she is a dear girl!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not forget to restore the treasure with gratitude proportionate to
      what the loan had cost Mary. With a trembling voice, she proffered it to
      him for the whole day, and every day, if she might only have it at night;
      and she even looked black when he did not accept the proposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is exactly like&mdash;&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t help being so, in a certain sense,&rdquo; he answered kindly, &ldquo;but
      after all, Mary dear, he did not pout out his chin in that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary was somewhat mortified, but she valued her photograph more than ever,
      because no one else would admire it, except Daisy, whom she had taught to
      regard it with unrivalled veneration.
    </p>
    <p>
      A letter soon arrived from Captain Gordon, giving a fuller account of the
      loss of his ship, and of the conduct of his officers, speaking in the
      highest terms of Alan Ernescliffe, for whom he said he mourned as for his
      own son, and, with scarcely less warmth, of Harry, mentioning the high
      esteem all had felt for the boy, and the good effect which the influence
      of his high and truthful spirit had produced on the other youngsters, who
      keenly regretted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Gordon added that the will of the late Captain Ernescliffe had
      made him guardian of his sons, and that he believed poor Alan had died
      intestate. He should therefore take upon himself the charge of young
      Hector, and he warmly thanked Dr. May and his family for all the kindness
      that the lad had received.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the loss of poor Hector&rsquo;s visits was regretted, it was, on the
      whole, a comforting letter, and would give still more comfort in future
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard contrived to come home through Oxford and see Norman, whom he
      found calm, and almost relieved by the cessation from suspense; not
      inclined, as his father had feared, to drown sorrow in labour, but
      regarding his grief as an additional call to devote himself to ministerial
      work. In fact, the blow had fallen when he first heard the rumour of
      danger, and could not recur with the same force.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard was surprised to find that Margaret was less cast down than he
      could have dared to hope. It did not seem like an affliction to her. Her
      countenance wore the same gentle smile, and she was as ready to
      participate in all that passed, finding sympathy for the little pleasures
      of Aubrey and Gertrude, and delighting in Flora&rsquo;s baby; as well as going
      over Cocksmoor politics with a clearness and accuracy that astonished him,
      and asking questions about his parish and occupations, so as fully to
      enjoy his short visit, which she truly called the greatest possible treat.
    </p>
    <p>
      If it had not been for the momentary consternation that she had seen upon
      Dr. Spencer&rsquo;s face, Ethel would have been perfectly satisfied; but she
      could not help sometimes entertaining a dim fancy that this composure came
      from a sense that she was too near Alan to mourn for him. Could it be true
      that her frame was more wasted, that there was less capability of
      exertion, that her hours became later in the morning, and that her nights
      were more wakeful? Would she fade away? Ethel longed to know what her
      father thought, but she could neither bear to inspire him with the
      apprehension, nor to ask Dr. Spencer&rsquo;s opinion, lest she should be
      confirmed in her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      The present affliction altered Dr. May more visibly than the death of his
      wife, perhaps, because there was not the same need of exertion. If he
      often rose high in faith and resignation, he would also sink very low
      under the sense of bereavement and disappointment. Though Richard was his
      stay, and Norman his pride, there was something in Harry more congenial to
      his own temper, and he could not but be bowed down by the ruin of such
      bright hopes. With all his real submission, he was weak, and gave way to
      outbursts of grief, for which he blamed himself as unthankful; and his
      whole demeanour was so saddened and depressed, that Ethel and Dr. Spencer
      consulted mournfully over him, whenever they walked to Cocksmoor together.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was not as often as usual, though the walls of the school were
      rising, for Dr. Spencer had taken a large share of his friend&rsquo;s work for
      the present, and both physicians were much occupied by the condition of
      Mr. Ramsden who was fast sinking, and, for some weeks, seemed only kept
      alive by their skill. The struggle ended at last, and his forty years&rsquo;
      cure of Stoneborough was closed. It made Dr. May very sad&mdash;his
      affections had tendrils for anything that he had known from boyhood; and
      though he had often spoken strong words of the vicar, he now sat
      sorrowfully moralising and making excuses. &ldquo;People in former times had not
      so high an estimate of pastoral duty&mdash;poor Mr. Ramsden had not much
      education&mdash;he was already old when better times came in&mdash;he
      might have done better in a less difficult parish with better laity to
      support him, etc.&rdquo; Yet after all, he exclaimed with one of his impatient
      gestures, &ldquo;Better have my Harry&rsquo;s seventeen years than his sixty-seven!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better improve a talent than lay it by!&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! Ethel. How do you know what he may have done? If he acted up to his
      own standard, he did more than most of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which is best,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;a high standard, not acted up to, or a lower
      one fulfilled?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it depends on the will,&rdquo; said Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some people are angry with those whose example would show that there is a
      higher standard,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And,&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;some who have the high one set before them content
      themselves with knowing that it cannot be fully attained, and will not
      try.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The standard is the effect of early impression,&rdquo; said Dr. May. &ldquo;I should
      be very sorry to think it could not be raised.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faithful in a little&mdash;&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;I suppose all good people&rsquo;s
      standard is always going higher.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As they comprehend more of absolute perfection,&rdquo; said Margaret.

      CHAPTER XV.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     The city&rsquo;s golden spire it was,
       When hope and health were strongest;
     But now it is the churchyard grass,
       We look upon the longest.&mdash;E. B. BROWNING.
</pre>
    <p>
      A disinclination for exertion or going into public hung upon Dr. May, but
      he was obliged to rouse himself to attend the Town Council meeting, which
      was held a few days after the vicar&rsquo;s funeral, to decide on the next
      appointment. If it had depended on himself alone, his choice would have
      been Mr. Edward Wilmot, whom the death of his good old father had uprooted
      from Settlesham; and the girls had much hope, but he was too much out of
      spirits to be sanguine. He said that he should only hear a great deal of
      offensive stuff from Tomkins the brewer; and that, in the desire to
      displease nobody, the votes should settle down on some nonentity, was the
      best which was likely to happen. Thus, grumbling, he set off, and his
      daughters watched anxiously for his return. They saw him come through the
      garden with a quick, light step, that made them augur well, and he entered
      the room with the corners of his mouth turning up. &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Ethel,
      &ldquo;it is all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were going to have made a very absurd choice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you prevented it? Who was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I told you Master Ritchie was turning out a popular preacher.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that they chose Richard!&rdquo; cried Margaret breathlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As sure as my name is Dick May, they did, every man of them, except
      Tomkins, and even he held his tongue; I did not think it of them,&rdquo; said
      the doctor, almost overcome; &ldquo;but there is much more goodness of heart in
      the world than one gives it credit for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And good Dr. May was not one to give the least credit for all that was
      like himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it was Richard&rsquo;s own doing,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;Those sermons made a
      great impression, and they love the boy, because he has grown up among
      them. The old mayor waddled up to me, as I came in, telling me that they
      had been talking it over, and they were unanimously agreed that they could
      not have a parson they should like better than Mr. Richard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good old Mr. Doddesley! I can see him!&rdquo; cried Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expected it so little, that I thought he meant some Richards; but no,
      he said Mr. Richard May, if he had nothing better in view&mdash;they liked
      him, and knew he was a very steady, good young gentleman, and if he took
      after his fathers that went before him&mdash;and they thought we might
      like to have him settled near!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How very kind!&rdquo; said Margaret, as the tears came. &ldquo;We shall love our own
      townsfolk better than ever!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always told you so, if you would but believe it. They have warm, sound
      hearts, every one of them! I declare, I did not know which way to look, I
      was so sorry to disappoint them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Disappoint them!&rdquo; cried Margaret, in consternation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was thinking,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;I do not believe Richard would think
      himself equal to this place in such a state as it is. He is so diffident.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Dr. May, &ldquo;if he were ten or twelve years older, it would be
      another thing; but here, where everything is to be done, he would not
      bring weight or force enough. He would only work himself to death, for
      individuals, without going to the root. Margaret, my darling, I am very
      sorry to have disappointed you so much&mdash;it would have been as great a
      pleasure as we could have had in this world to have the lad here&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Cocksmoor,&rdquo; sighed Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be grateful all my life to those good people for thinking of it,&rdquo;
       continued the doctor; &ldquo;but look you here, it was my business to get the
      best man chosen in my power and, though as to goodness, I believe the dear
      Ritchie has not many equals; I don&rsquo;t think we can conscientiously say he
      would be, at present, the best vicar for Stoneborough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel would not say no, for fear she should pain Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; continued Dr. May, &ldquo;after having staved off the sale of the
      presentation as a sin, it would hardly have been handsome to have let my
      own son profit by it. It would have seemed as if we had our private ends,
      when Richard helped poor old Mr. Ramsden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret owned this, and Ethel said Richard would be glad to be spared the
      refusal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was sure of it. The poor fellow would have been perplexed between the
      right and consideration for us. A vicar here ought to carry things with a
      high hand, and that is hardest to do at a man&rsquo;s own home, especially for a
      quiet lad like him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, papa, it was quite right,&rdquo; said Margaret, recovering herself; &ldquo;it
      has spared Richard a great deal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But are we to have Mr. Wilmot?&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;Think of our not having
      heard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay. If they would not have had Wilmot, or a man of his calibre, perhaps I
      might have let them offer it to Richard. I almost wish I had. With help,
      and Ethel&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, papa,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;You are making me angry with myself for my
      folly. It is much better for Richard himself, and for us all, as well as
      the town. Think how long we have wished for Mr. Wilmot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will be in time for the opening of Cocksmoor school!&rdquo; cried Ethel.
      &ldquo;How did you manage it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not manage at all,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;I told them exactly my mind,
      that Richard was not old enough for such arduous work; and though no words
      could tell how obliged I was, if they asked me who was the best man for it
      I knew, I should say Edward Wilmot, and I thought he deserved something
      from us, for the work he did gratis, when he was second master. Tomkins
      growled a little, but, fortunately, no one was prepared with another
      proposal, so they all came round, and the mayor is to write by this
      evening&rsquo;s post, and so shall I. If we could only have given Richard a
      dozen more years!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret was somewhat comforted to find that the sacrifice had cost her
      father a good deal; she was always slightly jealous for Richard, and now
      that Alan was gone, she clung to him more than ever. His soft calm manner
      supported her more than any other human comforter, and she always yearned
      after him when absent, more than for all the other brothers; but her
      father&rsquo;s decision had been too high-minded for her to dare to wish it
      recalled, and she could not but own that Richard would have had to undergo
      more toil and annoyance than perhaps his health would have endured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora had discontinued comments to her sisters on her father&rsquo;s
      proceedings, finding that observations mortified Margaret, and did not
      tend to peace with Ethel; but she told her husband that she did not regret
      it much, for Richard would have exhausted his own income, and his father&rsquo;s
      likewise, in paying curates, and raising funds for charities. She scarcely
      expected Mr. Edward Wilmot to accept the offer, aware as he was, of the
      many disadvantages he should have to contend with, and unsuccessful as he
      had been in dealing with the Ladies&rsquo; Committee.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, Mr. Wilmot signified his thankful acceptance, and, in due time,
      his familiar tap was heard at the drawing-room door, at tea-time, as if he
      had just returned after the holidays. He was most gladly welcomed, and
      soon was installed in his own place, with his goddaughter, Mary, blushing
      with pleasure at pouring out his coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Ethel, how is Cocksmoor? How like old times!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; cried Ethel, &ldquo;we are so glad you will see the beginning of the
      school!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear you are finishing Cherry Elwood, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much against Ethel&rsquo;s will,&rdquo; said Margaret; &ldquo;but we thought Cherry not
      easily spoiled. And Whitford school seems to be in very good order. Dr.
      Spencer went and had an inspection of it, and conferred with all the
      authorities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! we have a jewel of a parishioner for you,&rdquo; said Dr. May. &ldquo;I have some
      hopes of Stoneborough now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wilmot did not look too hopeful, but he smiled, and asked after Granny
      Hall, and the children.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Polly grew up quite civilised,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;She lives at Whitford, with
      some very respectable people, and sends granny presents, which make her
      merrier than ever. Last time it was a bonnet, and Jenny persuaded her to
      go to church in it, though, she said, what she called the moon of it was
      too small.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do the people go on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot say much for them. It is disheartening. We really have done
      nothing. So very few go to church regularly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None at all went in my time,&rdquo; said Mr. Wilmot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Elwood always goes,&rdquo; said Mary, &ldquo;and Taylor; yes, and Sam Hall, very
      often, and many of the women, in the evening, because they like to walk
      home with the children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The children? the Sunday scholars?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, every one that is big enough comes to school now, here, on Sunday. If
      only the teaching were better&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you sent out any more pupils to service?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not many. There is Willie Brown, trying to be Dr. Spencer&rsquo;s little
      groom,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am afraid it will take a great deal of the doctor&rsquo;s patience to
      train him,&rdquo; added Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is hard,&rdquo; said Dr. May. &ldquo;He did it purely to oblige Ethel; and, I tell
      her, when he lames the pony, I shall expect her to buy another for him,
      out of the Cocksmoor funds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel and Mary broke out in a chorus of defence of Willie Brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was Ben Wheeler,&rdquo; said Mary, &ldquo;who went to work in the quarries; and
      the men could not teach him to say bad words, because the young ladies
      told him not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The young ladies have not quite done nothing,&rdquo; said Dr. May, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These are only little stray things, and Cherry has done the chief of
      them,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;Oh, it is grievously bad still,&rdquo; she added, sighing.
      &ldquo;Such want of truth, such ungoverned tongues and tempers, such godlessness
      altogether! It is only surface-work, taming the children at school, while
      they have such homes; and their parents, even if they do come where they
      might learn better, are always liable to be upset, as they call it&mdash;turned
      out of their places in church, and they will not run the chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The church must come to them,&rdquo; said Mr. Wilmot. &ldquo;Could the school be made
      fit to be licensed for service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask our architect,&rdquo; said Dr. May. &ldquo;There can be little doubt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been settling that I must have a curate specially for Cocksmoor,&rdquo;
       said Mr. Wilmot. &ldquo;Can you tell me of one, Ethel&mdash;or perhaps Margaret
      could?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret could only smile faintly, for her heart was beating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seriously,&rdquo; said Mr. Wilmot, turning to Dr. May, &ldquo;do you think Richard
      would come and help us here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This seems to be his destiny,&rdquo; said the doctor, smiling, &ldquo;only it would
      not be fair to tell you, lest you should be jealous&mdash;that the Town
      Council had a great mind for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The matter was explained, and Mr. Wilmot was a great deal more struck by
      Dr. May&rsquo;s conduct than the good doctor thought it deserved. Every one was
      only too glad that Richard should come as Cocksmoor curate; and, though
      the stipend was very small&mdash;since Mr. Wilmot meant to have other
      assistance&mdash;yet, by living at home, it might be feasible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret&rsquo;s last words that night to Ethel were, &ldquo;The last wish I had dared
      to make is granted!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wilmot wrote to Richard, who joyfully accepted his proposal, and
      engaged to come home as soon as his present rector could find a
      substitute.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Spencer was delighted, and, it appeared, had already had a view to
      such possibilities in designing the plan of the school.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first good effect of Mr. Wilmot&rsquo;s coming was, that Dr. Spencer was
      cured of the vagrant habits of going to church at Abbotstoke or Fordholm,
      that had greatly concerned his friend. Dr. May, who could never get any
      answer from him except that he was not a Town Councillor, and, as to
      example, it was no way to set that to sleep through the sermon.
    </p>
    <p>
      To say that Dr. May never slept under the new dynasty would be an
      over-statement, but slumber certainly prevailed in the minster to a far
      less degree than formerly. One cause might be that it was not shut up
      unaired from one Sunday to another, but that the chime of the bells was no
      longer an extraordinary sound on a week-day. It was at first pronounced
      that time could not be found for going to church on week-days without
      neglecting other things, but Mary, who had lately sat very loose to the
      schoolroom, began gradually to slip down to church whenever the service
      was neither too early nor too late; and Gertrude was often found trotting
      by her side&mdash;going to mamma, as the little Daisy called it, from some
      confusion between the church and the cloister, which Ethel was in no hurry
      to disturb.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lectures in Lent filled the church a good deal, as much perhaps from the
      novelty as from better motives, and altogether there was a renewal of
      energy in parish work. The poor had become so little accustomed to
      pastoral care, that the doctors and the district visitors were obliged to
      report cases of sickness to the clergy, and vainly tried to rouse the
      people to send of their own accord. However, the better leaven began to
      work, and, of course, there was a ferment, though less violent than Ethel
      had expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wilmot set more cautiously to work than he had done in his younger
      days, and did not attack prejudices so openly, and he had an admirable
      assistant in Dr. Spencer. Every one respected the opinion of the travelled
      doctor, and he had a courteous clever process of the reduction to the
      absurd, which seldom failed to tell, while it never gave offence. As to
      the Ladies&rsquo; Committee, though there had been expressions of dismay, when
      the tidings of the appointment first went abroad, not one of the whole
      &ldquo;Aonian choir&rdquo; liked to dissent from Dr. Spencer, and he talked them over,
      individually, into a most conformable state, merely by taking their
      compliance for granted, and showing that he deemed it only the natural
      state of things, that the vicar should reign over the charities of the
      place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The committee was not dissolved&mdash;that would have been an act of
      violence&mdash;but it was henceforth subject to Mr. Wilmot, and he and his
      curates undertook the religious instruction in the week, and chose the
      books&mdash;a state of affairs brought about with so much quietness, that
      Ethel knew not whether Flora, Dr. Spencer, or Mr. Wilmot had been the
      chief mover.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ledwich was made treasurer of a new coal club, and Miss Rich keeper
      of the lending-library, occupations which delighted them greatly; and
      Ethel was surprised to find how much unity of action was springing up, now
      that the period was over, of each &ldquo;doing right in her own eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In fact,&rdquo; said Dr. Spencer, &ldquo;when women have enough to do, they are
      perfectly tractable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Cocksmoor accounts were Ethel&rsquo;s chief anxiety. It seemed as if now
      there might be a school-house, but with little income to depend upon,
      since poor Alan Ernescliffe&rsquo;s annual ten pounds was at an end. However,
      Dr. May leaned over her as she was puzzling over her pounds, shillings,
      and pence, and laid a cheque upon her desk. She looked up in his face. &ldquo;We
      must make Cocksmoor Harry&rsquo;s heir,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      By and by it appeared that Cocksmoor was not out of Hector Ernescliffe&rsquo;s
      mind. The boy&rsquo;s letters to Margaret had been brief, matter-of-fact, and
      discouraging, as long as the half-year lasted, and there was not much to
      be gathered about him from Tom, on his return for the Easter holidays, but
      soon poor Hector wrote a long dismal letter to Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Gordon had taken him to Maplewood, where the recollection of his
      brother, and the happy hopes with which they had taken possession, came
      thronging upon him. The house was forlorn, and the corner that had been
      unpacked for their reception, was as dreary a contrast to the bright home
      at Stoneborough, as was the dry, stern captain, to the fatherly
      warm-hearted doctor. Poor Hector had little or nothing to do, and the
      pleasure of possession had not come yet; he had no companion of his own
      age, and bashfulness made him shrink with dislike from introduction to his
      tenants and neighbours.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was not an entertaining book in the house, he declared, and the
      captain snubbed him, if he bought anything he cared to read. The captain
      was always at him to read musty old improving books, and talking about the
      position he would occupy. The evenings were altogether unbearable, and if
      it were not for rabbit shooting now, and the half-year soon beginning
      again, Hector declared he should be ready to cut and run, and leave
      Captain Gordon and Maplewood to each other&mdash;and very well matched
      too! He was nearly in a state of mind to imitate that unprecedented boy,
      who wrote a letter to &lsquo;The Times&rsquo;, complaining of extra weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to Cocksmoor, Ethel must not think it forgotten; he had spoken to the
      captain about it, and the old wooden-head had gone and answered that it
      was not incumbent on him, that Cocksmoor had no claims upon him, and he
      could not make it up out of his allowance; for the old fellow would not
      give him a farthing more than he had before, and had said that was too
      much.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a great blur over the words &ldquo;wooden-head,&rdquo; as if Hector had
      known that Margaret would disapprove, and had tried to scratch it out. She
      wrote all the consolation in her power, and exhorted him to patience,
      apparently without much effect. She would not show his subsequent letters,
      and the reading and answering them fatigued her so much, that Hector&rsquo;s
      writing was an unwelcome sight at Stoneborough. Each letter, as Ethel
      said, seemed so much taken out of her, and she begged her not to think
      about them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing can do me much good or harm now,&rdquo; said Margaret; and seeing
      Ethel&rsquo;s anxious looks, &ldquo;Is it not my greatest comfort that Hector can
      still treat me as his sister, or, if I can only be of any use in keeping
      him patient? Only think of the danger of a boy, in his situation, being
      left without sympathy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing more to be said. They all felt it was good for them that
      the building at Cocksmoor gave full occupation to thoughts and
      conversation; indeed, Tom declared they never walked in any other
      direction, nor talked of anything else, and that without Hector, or George
      Rivers, he had nobody to speak to. However, he was a good deal
      tranquillised by an introduction to Dr. Spencer&rsquo;s laboratory, where he
      compounded mixtures that Dr. Spencer promised should do no more harm than
      was reasonable to himself, or any one else. Ethel suspected that, if Tom
      had chanced to singe his eyebrows, his friend would not have regretted a
      blight to his nascent coxcombry, but he was far too careful of his own
      beauty to do any such thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard was set at liberty just before Easter, and came home to his new
      charge. He was aware of what had taken place, and heartily grateful for
      the part his father had taken. To work at Cocksmoor, under Mr. Wilmot, and
      to live at home, was felicity; and he fitted at once into his old place,
      and resumed all the little home services for which he had been always
      famed. Ethel was certain that Margaret was content, when she saw her
      brother bending over her, and the sense of reliance and security that the
      presence of the silent Richard imparted to the whole family was something
      very peculiar, especially as they were so much more active and
      demonstrative than he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wilmot put him at once in charge of the hamlet. The inhabitants were
      still a hard, rude, unpromising race, and there were many flagrant evils
      amongst them, but the last few years had not been without some effect&mdash;some
      were less obdurate, a few really touched, and, almost all, glad of
      instruction for their children. If Ethel&rsquo;s perseverance had done nothing
      else, it had, at least, been a witness, and her immediate scholars showed
      the influence of her lessons.

      CHAPTER XVI.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   Then out into the world, my course I did determine;
   Though, to be rich was not my wish, yet to be great was charming.
   My talents they were not the worst, nor yet my education;
   Resolved was I, at least to try, to mend my situation.&mdash;BURNS.
</pre>
    <p>
      In the meantime, the session of Parliament had begun, and the Rivers&rsquo;
      party had, since February, inhabited Park Lane. Meta had looked pale and
      pensive, as she bade her friends at Stoneborough good-bye; but only
      betrayed that she had rather have stayed at home, by promising herself
      great enjoyment in meeting them again at Easter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora was, on the other hand, in the state of calm patronage that
      betokened perfect satisfaction. She promised wonders for Miss Bracy&rsquo;s
      sisters&mdash;talked of inviting Mary and Blanche to see sights and take
      lessons; and undertook to send all the apparatus needed by Cocksmoor
      school; and she did, accordingly, send down so many wonderful articles,
      that curate and schoolmistress were both frightened; Mrs. Taylor thought
      the easels were new-fashioned instruments of torture; and Ethel found
      herself in a condition to be liberal to Stoneborough National School.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora was a capital correspondent, and made it her business to keep
      Margaret amused, so that the home-party were well informed of the doings
      of each of her days&mdash;and very clever her descriptions were. She had
      given herself a dispensation from general society until after Easter; but,
      in the meantime, both she and Meta seemed to find great enjoyment in
      country rides and drives, and in quiet little dinners at home, to George&rsquo;s
      agreeable political friends. With the help of two such ladies as Mrs. and
      Miss Rivers, Ethel could imagine George&rsquo;s house pleasant enough to attract
      clever people; but she was surprised to find how full her sister&rsquo;s letters
      were of political news.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a period when great interests were in agitation; and the details of
      London talk and opinions were extremely welcome. Dr. Spencer used to come
      in to ask after &ldquo;Mrs. Rivers&rsquo;s Intelligencer&rdquo;; and, when he heard the
      lucid statements, would say, she ought to have been a &ldquo;special
      correspondent.&rdquo; And her father declared that her news made him twice as
      welcome to his patients; but her cleverest sentences always were prefaced
      with &ldquo;George says,&rdquo; or &ldquo;George thinks,&rdquo; in a manner that made her appear
      merely the dutiful echo of his sentiments.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an early letter, Flora mentioned how she had been reminded of poor
      Harry, by finding Miss Walkinghame&rsquo;s card. That lady lived with her mother
      at Richmond, and, on returning the visit, Flora was warmly welcomed by the
      kind old Lady Walkinghame, who insisted on her bringing her baby and
      spending a long day. The sisters-in-law had been enchanted with Miss
      Walkinghame, whose manners, wrote Flora, certainly merited papa&rsquo;s
      encomium.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the promised &ldquo;long day,&rdquo; they found an unexpected addition to the
      party, Sir Henry Walkinghame, who had newly returned from the continent.
      &ldquo;A fine-looking, agreeable man, about five-and-thirty,&rdquo; Flora described
      him, &ldquo;very lively and entertaining. He talked a great deal of Dr. Spencer,
      and of the life in the caves at Thebes; and he asked me whether that
      unfortunate place, Cocksmoor, did not owe a great deal to me, or to one of
      my sisters. I left Meta to tell him that story, and they became very
      sociable over it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A day or two after&mdash;&ldquo;Sir Henry Walkinghame has been dining with us.
      He has a very good voice, and we had some delightful music in the
      evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By and by Sir Henry was the second cavalier, when they went to an
      oratorio, and Meta&rsquo;s letter overflowed with the descriptions she had heard
      from him of Italian church music. He always went to Rome for Easter, and
      had been going as usual, this spring, but he lingered, and, for once,
      remained in England, where he had only intended to spend a few days on
      necessary business.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Easter recess was not spent at the Grange, but at Lady Leonora&rsquo;s
      pretty house in Surrey. She had invited the party in so pressing a manner
      that Flora did not think it right to decline. Meta expressed some
      disappointment at missing Easter among her school-children, but she said a
      great deal about the primroses and the green corn-fields, and nightingales&mdash;all
      which Ethel would have set down to her trick of universal content, if it
      had not appeared that Sir Henry was there too, and shared in all the
      delicious rides.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would Ethel say,&rdquo; wrote Flora, &ldquo;to have our little Meta as Lady of
      the Manor of Cocksmoor? He has begun to talk about Drydale, and there are
      various suspicious circumstances that Lady Leonora marks with the eyes of
      a discreet dowager. It was edifying to see how, from smiles, we came to
      looks, and by and by to confidential talks, which have made her entirely
      forgive me for having so many tall brothers. Poor dear old Mr. Rivers!
      Lady Leonora owns that it was the best thing possible for that sweet girl
      that he did not live any longer to keep her in seclusion; it is so
      delightful to see her appreciated as she deserves, and with her beauty and
      fortune, she might make any choice she pleases. In fact, I believe Lady
      Leonora would like to look still higher for her, but this would be mere
      ambition, and we should be far better satisfied with such a connection as
      this, founded on mutual and increasing esteem, with a man so well suited
      to her, and fixing her so close to us. You must not, however, launch out
      into an ocean of possibilities, for the good aunt has only infected me
      with the castle-building propensities of chaperons, and Meta is perfectly
      unconscious, looking on him as too hopelessly middle-aged, to entertain
      any such evil designs, avowing freely that she likes him, and treating him
      very nearly as she does papa. It is my business to keep &lsquo;our aunt,&rsquo; who,
      between ourselves, has, below the surface, the vulgarity of nature that
      high-breeding cannot eradicate, from startling the little humming-bird,
      before the net has been properly twined round her bright little heart. As
      far as I can see, he is much smitten, but very cautious in his approaches,
      and he is wise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret did not know what dismay she conveyed, as she handed this letter
      to her sister. There was no rest for Ethel till she could be alone with
      her father. &ldquo;Could nothing prevent it? Could not Flora be told of Mr.
      Rivers&rsquo;s wishes?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His wishes would have lain this way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is no concern of ours. There is nothing objectionable here, and though
      I can&rsquo;t say it is not a disappointment, it ought not to be. The long and
      short of it is, that I never ought to have told you anything about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Norman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absurd! The lad is hardly one-and-twenty. Very few marry a first love.&rdquo;
       (Ah, Ethel!) &ldquo;Poor old Rivers only mentioned it as a refuge from
      fortune-hunters, and it stands to reason that he would have preferred
      this. Anyway, it is awkward for a man with empty pockets to marry an
      heiress, and it is wholesomer for him to work for his living. Better that
      it should be out of his head at once, if it were there at all. I trust it
      was all our fancy. I would not have him grieved now for worlds, when his
      heart is sore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somehow,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;though he is depressed and silent, I like it
      better than I did last Christmas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, when we were laughing out of the bitterness of our hearts,&rdquo;
       said Dr. May, sighing. &ldquo;It is a luxury to let oneself alone to be
      sorrowful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel did not know whether she desired a tete-a-tete with Norman or not.
      She was aware that he had seen Flora&rsquo;s letter, and she did not believe
      that he would ever mention the hopes that must have been dashed by it; or,
      if he should do so, how could she ever guard her father&rsquo;s secret? At
      least, she had the comfort of recognising the accustomed Norman in his
      manner, low-spirited, indeed, and more than ever dreamy and melancholy,
      but not in the unnatural and excited state that had made her unhappy about
      him. She could not help telling Dr. Spencer that this was much more the
      real brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say,&rdquo; was the answer, not quite satisfactory in tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you would like it better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truth is better than fiction, certainly. But I am afraid he has a
      tendency to morbid self-contemplation, and you ought to shake him out of
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the difference between self-contemplation and self-examination?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The difference between your brother and yourself. Ah! you think that no
      answer. Will you have a medical simile? Self-examination notes the
      symptoms and combats them; self-contemplation does as I did when I was
      unstrung by that illness at Poonshedagore, and was always feeling my own
      pulse. It dwells on them, and perpetually deplores itself. Oh, dear! this
      is no better&mdash;what a wretch I am. It is always studying its
      deformities in a moral looking-glass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think poor Norman does that, but I thought it right and humble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The humility of a self-conscious mind. It is the very reverse of your
      father, who is the most really humble man in existence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you call self-consciousness a fault?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I call it a misfortune. In the vain, it leads to prudent vanity; in
      the good, to a painful effort of humility.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I quite understand what it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, and you have so much of your father in you, that you never will. But
      take care of your brother, and don&rsquo;t let his brains work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How Ethel was to take care of him she did not know; she could only keep a
      heedful eye on him, and rejoice when he took Tom out for a long walk&mdash;a
      companion certainly not likely to promote the working of the brain&mdash;but
      though it was in the opposite direction to Cocksmoor, Tom came home
      desperately cross, snubbed Gertrude, and fagged Aubrey; but, then, as
      Blanche observed, perhaps that was only because his trousers were
      splashed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In her next solitary walk to Cocksmoor, Norman joined Ethel. She was
      gratified, but she could not think of one safe word worth saying to him,
      and for a mile they preserved an absolute silence, until he first began,
      &ldquo;Ethel, I have been thinking&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you have!&rdquo; said she, between hope and dread, and the thrill of being
      again treated as his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to consult you. Don&rsquo;t you think now that Richard is settled at
      home, and if Tom will study medicine, that I could be spared.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spared!&rdquo; exclaimed Ethel. &ldquo;You are not much at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I meant more than my present absences. It is my earnest wish&mdash;&rdquo; he
      paused, and the continuation took her by surprise. &ldquo;Do you think it would
      give my father too much pain to part with me as a missionary to New
      Zealand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She could only gaze at him in mute amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think he could bear it?&rdquo; said Norman hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He would consent,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Oh, Norman, it is the most glorious
      thing man can do! How I wish I could go with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mission is here,&rdquo; said Norman affectionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it is&mdash;I am contented with it,&rdquo; said Ethel; &ldquo;but oh! Norman,
      after all our talks about races and gifts, you have found the more
      excellent way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! Charity finds room at home, and mine are not such unmixed motives
      as yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made a sound of inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot tell you all. Some you shall hear. I am weary of this feverish
      life of competition and controversy&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you were so happy with your fellowship. I thought Oxford was
      your delight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will always be nearer my heart than any place, save this. It is not
      her fault that I am not like the simple and dutiful, who are not fretted
      or perplexed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perplexed?&rdquo; repeated Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not so now,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;God forbid! But where better men have
      been led astray, I have been bewildered; till, Ethel, I have felt as if
      the ground were slipping from beneath my feet, and I have only been able
      to hide my eyes, and entreat that I might know the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You knew it!&rdquo; said Ethel, looking pale, and gazing searchingly at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did, I do; but it was a time of misery when, for my presumption, I
      suppose, I was allowed to doubt whether it were the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel recoiled, but came nearer, saying, very low, &ldquo;It is past.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, thank Him who is Truth. You all saved me, though you did not know
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When was this?&rdquo; she asked timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The worst time was before the Long Vacation. They told me I ought to read
      this book and that. Harvey Anderson used to come primed with arguments. I
      could always overthrow them, but when I came to glory in doing so, perhaps
      I prayed less. Anyway, they left a sting. It might be that I doubted my
      own sincerity, from knowing that I had got to argue, chiefly because I
      liked to be looked on as a champion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel saw the truth of what her friend had said of the morbid habit of
      self-contemplation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I read, and I mystified myself. The better I talked, the more my own
      convictions failed me; and, by the time you came up to Oxford, I knew how
      you would have shrunk from him who was your pride, if you could have seen
      into the secrets beneath.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel took hold of his hand. &ldquo;You seemed bright,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It melted like a bad dream before&mdash;before the humming-bird, and with
      my father. It was weeks ere I dared to face the subject again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could you? Was it safe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not have gone on as I was. Sometimes the sight of my father, or
      the mountains and lakes in Scotland, or&mdash;or&mdash;things at the
      Grange, would bring peace back; but there were dark hours, and I knew that
      there could be no comfort till I had examined and fought it out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose examination was right,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;for a man, and defender of
      the faith. I should only have tried to pray the terrible thought away. But
      I can&rsquo;t tell how it feels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worse than you have power to imagine,&rdquo; said Norman, shuddering. &ldquo;It is
      over now. I worked out their fallacies, and went over the reasoning on our
      side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And prayed&mdash;&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I did; and the confidence returned, firmer, I hope, than ever. It
      had never gone for a whole day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel breathed freely. &ldquo;It was life or death,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and we never
      knew it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not; but I know your prayers were angel-wings ever round me. And
      far more than argument, was the thought of my father&rsquo;s heart-whole
      Christian love and strength.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Norman, you believed, all the time, with your heart. This was only a
      bewilderment of your intellect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you are right,&rdquo; said Norman. &ldquo;To me the doubt was cruel agony&mdash;not
      the amusement it seems to some.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because our dear home has made the truth, our joy, our union,&rdquo; said
      Ethel. &ldquo;And you are sure the cloud is gone, and for ever?&rdquo; she still asked
      anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood still. &ldquo;For ever, I trust,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I hold the faith of my
      childhood in all its fullness as surely as&mdash;as ever I loved my mother
      and Harry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you do,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;It was only a bad dream.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope I may be forgiven for it,&rdquo; said Norman. &ldquo;I do not know how far it
      was sin. It was gone so far as that my mind was convinced last Christmas,
      but the shame and sting remained. I was not at peace again till the news
      of this spring came, and brought, with the grief, this compensation&mdash;that
      I could cast behind me and forget the criticisms and doubts that those
      miserable debates had connected with sacred words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be the sounder for having fought the fight,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not dread the like shocks,&rdquo; said her brother, &ldquo;but I long to leave
      this world of argument and discussion. It is right that there should be a
      constant defence and battle, but I am not fit for it. I argue for my own
      triumph, and, in heat and harassing, devotion is lost. Besides, the
      comparison of intellectual power has been my bane all my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought &lsquo;praise was your penance here.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would fain render it so, but&mdash;in short, I must be away from it
      all, and go to the simplest, hardest work, beginning from the rudiments,
      and forgetting subtle arguments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgetting yourself,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right. I want to have no leisure to think about myself,&rdquo; said Norman. &ldquo;I
      am never so happy as at such times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you want to find work so far away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot help feeling drawn towards those southern seas. I am glad you
      can give me good-speed. But what do you think about my father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel thought and thought. &ldquo;I know he would not hinder you,&rdquo; she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you dread the pain for him? I had talked to Tom about taking his
      profession; but the poor boy thinks he dislikes it greatly, though, I
      believe, his real taste lies that way, and his aversion only arises a few
      grand notions he has picked up, out of which I could soon talk him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom will not stand in your place,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will be more equable and more to be depended upon,&rdquo; said Norman. &ldquo;None
      of you appreciate Tom. However, you must hear my alternative. If you think
      my going would be too much grief for papa, or if Tom be set against
      helping him in his practice, there is an evident leading of Providence,
      showing that I am unworthy of this work. In that case I would go abroad
      and throw myself, at once, with all my might, into the study of medicine,
      and get ready to give my father some rest. It is a shame that all his sons
      should turn away from his profession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am more than ever amazed!&rdquo; cried Ethel. &ldquo;I thought you detested it. I
      thought papa never wished it for you. He said you had not nerve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was always full of the tenderest consideration for me,&rdquo; said Norman.
      &ldquo;With Heaven to help him, a man may have nerve for whatever is his duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How he would like to have you to watch and help. But New Zealand would be
      so glorious!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glory is not for me,&rdquo; said Norman. &ldquo;Understand, Ethel, the choice is New
      Zealand, or going at once&mdash;at once, mind&mdash;to study at Edinburgh
      or Paris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;New Zealand at once?&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I mast stay for divinity lectures, but my intention must be
      avowed,&rdquo; said Norman hastily. &ldquo;And now, will you sound my father? I
      cannot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t sound,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;I can only do things point-blank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do then,&rdquo; said Norman, &ldquo;any way you can! Only let me know which is best
      for him. You get all the disagreeable things to do, good old unready one,&rdquo;
       he added kindly. &ldquo;I believe you are the one who would be shoved in front,
      if we were obliged to face a basilisk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The brightness that had come over Norman, when he had discharged his cares
      upon her, was encouragement enough for Ethel. She only asked how much she
      was to repeat of their conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever you think best. I do not want to grieve him, but he must not
      think it fine in me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel privately thought that no power on earth could prevent him from
      doing that.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not consistent with cautious sounding, that Norman was always
      looking appealingly towards her; and, indeed, she could not wait long with
      such a question on her mind. She remained with her father in the
      drawing-room, when the rest were gone upstairs, and, plunging at once into
      the matter, she said, &ldquo;Papa, there is something that Norman cannot bear to
      say to you himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humming-birds to wit?&rdquo; said Dr. May.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed, but he wants to be doing something at once. What should you
      think of&mdash;of&mdash;there are two things; one is&mdash;going out as a
      missionary&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humming-birds in another shape,&rdquo; said the doctor, startled, but smiling,
      so as to pique her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean to treat it as a boy&rsquo;s fancy!&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is rather suspicious,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Well, what is the other of his two
      things?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The other is, to begin studying medicine at once, so as to help you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heyday!&rdquo; cried Dr. May, drawing up his tall vigorous figure, &ldquo;does he
      think me so very ancient and superannuated?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What could possess him to be so provoking and unsentimental to-night? Was
      it her own bad management? She longed to put an end to the conversation,
      and answered, &ldquo;No, but he thinks it hard that none of your sons should be
      willing to relieve you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be Norman,&rdquo; said Dr. May. &ldquo;He is not made of the stuff. If he
      survived the course of study, every patient he lost, he would bring
      himself in guilty of murder, and there would soon be an end of him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says that a man can force himself to anything that is his duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is not going to be his duty, if I can make it otherwise. What is the
      meaning of all this? No, I need not ask, poor boy, it is what I was afraid
      of!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is far deeper,&rdquo; said Ethel; and she related great part of what she had
      heard in the afternoon. It was not easy to make her father listen&mdash;his
      line was to be positively indignant, rather than compassionate, when he
      heard of the doubts that had assailed poor Norman. &ldquo;Foolish boy, what
      business had he to meddle with those accursed books, when he knew what
      they were made of&mdash;it was tasting poison, it was running into
      temptation! He had no right to expect to come out safe&mdash;&rdquo; and then he
      grasped tightly hold of Ethel&rsquo;s hands, and, as if the terror had suddenly
      flashed on him, asked her, with dilated eye and trembling voice, whether
      she were sure that he was safe, and held the faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel repeated his asseveration, and her father covered his face with his
      hands in thanksgiving.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this, he seemed somewhat inclined to hold poor Oxford in horror,
      only, as he observed, it would be going out of the frying-pan into the
      fire, to take refuge at Paris&mdash;a recurrence to the notion of Norman&rsquo;s
      medical studies, that showed him rather enticed by the proposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sent Ethel to bed, saying he should talk to Norman and find out what
      was the meaning of it, and she walked upstairs, much ashamed of having so
      ill served her brother, as almost to have made him ridiculous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr May and Norman never failed to come to an understanding, and after they
      had had a long drive into the country together, Dr May told Ethel that he
      was afraid, of what he ought not to be afraid of, that she was right, that
      the lad was very much in earnest now at any rate, and if he should
      continue in the same mind, he hoped he should not be so weak as to hold
      him from a blessed work.
    </p>
    <p>
      From Norman, Ethel heard the warmest gratitude for his father&rsquo;s kindness.
      Nothing could be done yet, he must wait patiently for the present, but he
      was to write to his uncle, Mr. Arnott, in New Zealand, and, without
      pledging himself, to make inquiries as to the mission; and in the
      meantime, return to Oxford, where, to his other studies, he was to add a
      course of medical lectures, which, as Dr. May said, would do him no harm,
      would occupy his mind, and might turn to use wherever he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel was surprised to find that Norman wrote to Flora an expression of
      his resolution, that, if he found he could be spared from assisting his
      father as a physician, he would give himself up to the mission in New
      Zealand. Why should he tell any one so unsympathetic as Flora, who would
      think him wasted in either case?

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Do not fear: Heaven is as near,
     By water, as by land.&mdash;LONGFELLOW.
</pre>
    <p>
      The fifth of May was poor Harry&rsquo;s eighteenth birthday, and, as usual, was
      a holiday. Etheldred privately thought his memory more likely to be
      respected, if Blanche and Aubrey were employed, than if they were left in
      idleness; but Mary would have been wretched had the celebration been
      omitted, and a leisure day was never unwelcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Spencer carried off Blanche and Aubrey for a walk, and Ethel found
      Mary at her great resort&mdash;Harry&rsquo;s cupboard&mdash;dusting and
      arranging his books, and the array of birthday gifts, to which, even
      to-day, she had not failed to add the marker that had been in hand at
      Christmas. Ethel entreated her to come down, and Mary promised, and
      presently appeared, looking so melancholy, that, as a sedative, Ethel set
      her down to the basket of scraps to find materials for a tippet for some
      one at Cocksmoor, intending, as soon as Margaret should be dressed, to
      resign her morning to the others, invite Miss Bracy to the drawing-room,
      and read aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gertrude was waiting for her walk, till nurse should have dressed
      Margaret, and was frisking about the lawn, sometimes looking in at the
      drawing-room window at her sisters, sometimes chattering to Adams at his
      work, or laughing to herself and the flowers, in that overflow of mirth,
      that seemed always bubbling up within her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was standing in rapt contemplation of a pear-tree in full blossom, her
      hands tightly clasped behind the back, for greater safety from the
      temptation, when, hearing the shrubbery gate open, she turned, expecting
      to see her papa, but was frightened at the sight of two strangers, and
      began to run off at full speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop! Blanche! Blanche, don&rsquo;t you know me?&rdquo; The voice was that tone of
      her brother&rsquo;s, and she stood and looked, but it came from a tall, ruddy
      youth, in a shabby rough blue coat, followed by a grizzled old seaman. She
      was too much terrified and perplexed even to run.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter! Blanche, it is I! Why, don&rsquo;t you know me&mdash;Harry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor brother Harry is drowned,&rdquo; she answered; and, with one bound, he was
      beside her, and, snatching her up, devoured her with kisses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put me down&mdash;put me down, please,&rdquo; was all she could say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not Blanche! What? the little Daisy, I do believe!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am Gertrude, but please let me go;&rdquo; and, at the same time, Adams
      hurried up, as if he thought her being kidnapped, but his aspect changed
      at the glad cry, &ldquo;Ha! Adams&rsquo; how are you? Are they all well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t never Master Harry! Bless me!&rdquo; as Harry&rsquo;s hand gave him sensible
      proof; &ldquo;when we had given you up for lost!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father well?&rdquo; Harry asked, hurrying the words one over the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite well, sir, but he never held up his head since he heard it, and
      poor Miss Mary has so moped about. If ever I thought to see the like&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So they did not get my letter, but I can&rsquo;t stop. Jennings will tell you.
      Take care of him. Come, Daisy&mdash;&rdquo; for he had kept her unwilling hand
      all the time. &ldquo;But what&rsquo;s that for?&rdquo; pointing to the black ribbons, and,
      stopping short, startled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because of poor Harry,&rdquo; said the bewildered child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; cried he, striding on, and dragging her in a
      breathless run, as he threw open the well-known doors; and, she escaping
      from him, hid her face in Mary&rsquo;s lap, screaming, &ldquo;He says he is Harry! he
      says he is not drowned!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the same moment Ethel was in his arms, and his voice was sobbing,
      &ldquo;Ethel! Mary! home! Where&rsquo;s papa?&rdquo; One moment&rsquo;s almost agonising joy in
      the certainty of his identity! but ere she could look or think, he was
      crying, &ldquo;Mary! oh, Ethel, see&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary had not moved, but sat as if turned to stone, with breath suspended,
      wide-stretched eyes, and death-like cheeks&mdash;Ethel sprang to her,
      &ldquo;Mary, Mary dear, it is Harry! It is himself! Don&rsquo;t you see? Speak to her,
      Harry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seemed almost afraid to do so, but, recovering himself, exclaimed,
      &ldquo;Mary, dear old Polly, here I am! Oh, won&rsquo;t you speak to me?&rdquo; he added
      piteously, as he threw his arm round her and kissed her, startled at the
      cold touch of her cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spell seemed broken, and, with a wild hoarse shriek that rang through
      the house, she struggled to regain her breath, but it would only come in
      painful, audible catches, as she held Harry&rsquo;s hand convulsively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have I done?&rdquo; he exclaimed, in distress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this! Who is this frightening my dear?&rdquo; was old nurse&rsquo;s
      exclamation, as she and James came at the outcry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nurse, what have I done to her?&rdquo; repeated Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is joy&mdash;it is sudden joy!&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;See, she is better now&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Master Harry! Well, I never!&rdquo; and James, &ldquo;with one wring of the hand,
      retreated, while old nurse was nearly hugged to death, declaring all the
      time that he didn&rsquo;t ought to have come in such a way, terrifying every one
      out of their senses! and as for poor Miss May&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo; cried Harry, starting at the sight of the vacant sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only upstairs,&rdquo; said Ethel; &ldquo;but where&rsquo;s Alan? Is not he come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Ethel, don&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo; His face told but too plainly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nurse! nurse, how shall we tell her?&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor dear!&rdquo; exclaimed nurse, sounding her tongue on the roof of her
      mouth. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll never abear it without her papa. Wait for him, I should
      say. But bless me, Miss Mary, to see you go on like that, when Master
      Harry is come back such a bonny man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m better now,&rdquo; said Mary, with an effort. &ldquo;Oh, Harry! speak to me
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Margaret!&rdquo; said Ethel, while the brother was holding Mary in his
      embrace, and she lay tremulous with the new ecstasy upon his breast&mdash;&ldquo;but
      Margaret. Nurse, you must go up, or she will suspect. I&rsquo;ll come when I
      can; speak quietly. Oh! poor Margaret! If Richard would but come in!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel walked up and down the room, divided between a tumult of joy, grief,
      dread, and perplexity. At that moment a little voice said at the door,
      &ldquo;Please, Margaret wants Harry to come up directly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They looked one upon another in consternation. They had never thought of
      the child, who, of course, had flown up at once with the tidings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go up, Miss Ethel,&rdquo; said nurse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! nurse, I can&rsquo;t be the first. Come, Harry, come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hand-in-hand, they silently ascended the stairs, and Ethel pushed open the
      door. Margaret was on her couch, her whole form and face in one throb of
      expectation.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked into Harry&rsquo;s face&mdash;the eagerness flitted like sunshine on
      the hillside, before a cloud, and, without a word, she held out her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      He threw himself on his knees, and her fingers were clasped among his
      thick curls, while his frame heaved with suppressed sobs, &ldquo;Oh, if he could
      only have come back to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God,&rdquo; she said; then slightly pushing him back, she lay holding his
      hand in one of hers, and resting the other on his shoulder, and gazing in
      silence into his face. Each was still&mdash;she was gathering strength&mdash;he
      dreaded word or look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me how and where;&rdquo; she said at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was in the Loyalty Isles; it was fever&mdash;the exertions for us. His
      head was lying here,&rdquo; and he pointed to his own breast. &ldquo;He sent his love
      to you&mdash;he bade me tell you there would be meeting by and by, in the
      haven where he would be.&mdash;I laid his head in the grave&mdash;under
      the great palm&mdash;I said some of the prayers&mdash;there are Christians
      round it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He said this in short disconnected phrases, often pausing to gather voice,
      but forced to resume, by her inquiring looks and pressure of his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      She asked no more. &ldquo;Kiss me,&rdquo; she said, and when he had done so, &ldquo;Thank
      you, go down, please, all of you. You have brought great relief. Thank
      you. But I can&rsquo;t talk yet. You shall tell me the rest by and by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sent them all away, even Ethel, who would have lingered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to him, dearest. Let me be alone. Don&rsquo;t be uneasy. This is peace&mdash;but
      go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel found Mary and Harry interlaced into one moving figure, and Harry
      greedily asking for his father and Norman, as if famishing for the sight
      of them. He wanted to set out to seek the former in the town, but his
      movements were too uncertain, and the girls clung to the newly-found, as
      if they could not trust him away from them. They wandered about, speaking,
      all three at random, without power of attending to the answers. It was
      enough to see him, and touch him; they could not yet care where he had
      been.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. May was in the midst of them ere they were aware. One look, and he
      flung his arms round his son, but, suddenly letting him go, he burst away,
      and banged his study door. Harry would have followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Ethel; then, seeing him disappointed, she came nearer,
      and murmured, &ldquo;&lsquo;He entered into his chamber and&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harry silenced her with another embrace, but their father was with them
      again, to verify that he had really seen his boy, and ask, alas! whether
      Alan were with Margaret. The brief sad answer sent him to see how it was
      with her. She would not let him stay; she said it was infinite comfort,
      and joy was coming, but she would rather be still, and not come down till
      evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps others would fain have been still, could they have borne an
      instant&rsquo;s deprivation of the sight of their dear sailor, while greetings
      came thickly on him. The children burst in, having heard a report in the
      town, and Dr. Spencer waited at the door for the confirmation; but when
      Ethel would have flown out to him, he waved his hand, shut the door, and
      hurried away, as if a word to her would have been an intrusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The brothers had been summoned by a headlong apparition of Will Adams in
      Cocksmoor school, shouting that Master Harry was come home; and Norman&rsquo;s
      long legs out-speeding Richard, had brought him back, flushed, and too
      happy for one word, while, &ldquo;Well, Harry,&rdquo; was Richard&rsquo;s utmost, and his
      care for Margaret seemed to overpower everything else, as he went up, and
      was not so soon sent away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Words were few downstairs. Blanche and Aubrey agreed that they thought
      people would have been much happier, but, in fact, the joy was oppressive
      from very newness. Ethel roamed about, she could not sit still without
      feeling giddy, in the strangeness of the revulsion. Her father sat, as if
      a word would break the blest illusion; and Harry stood before each of them
      in turn, as if about to speak, but turned his address into a sudden
      caress, or blow on the shoulder, and tried to laugh. Little Gertrude, not
      understanding; the confusion, had taken up her station under the table,
      and peeped out from beneath the cover.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was more composure as they sat at dinner, and yet there was very
      little talking or eating. Afterwards Dr. May and Norman exultingly walked
      away, to show their Harry to Dr. Spencer and Mr. Wilmot; and Ethel would
      gladly have tried to calm herself, and recover the balance of her mind, by
      giving thanks where they were due; but she did not know what to do with
      her sisters. Blanche was wild, and Mary still in so shaky a state of
      excitement, that she went off into mad laughing, when Blanche discovered
      that they were in mourning for Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing would satisfy Blanche but breaking in on Margaret, and climbing to
      the top of the great wardrobe to disinter the coloured raiment, beseeching
      that each favourite might be at once put on, to do honour to Harry. Mary
      chimed in with her, in begging for the wedding merinos&mdash;would not
      Margaret wear her beautiful blue?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my dear, I cannot,&rdquo; said Margaret gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary looked at her and was again in a flood of tears, incoherently
      protesting, together with Ethel, that they would not change.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, dears,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;I had rather you did so. You must not be
      unkind to Harry. He will not think I do not welcome him. I am only too
      glad that Richard would not let my impatience take away my right to wear
      this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel knew that it was for life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary could not check her tears, and would go on making heroic protests
      against leaving off her black, sobbing the more at each. Margaret&rsquo;s gentle
      caresses seemed to make her worse, and Ethel, afraid that Margaret&rsquo;s own
      composure would be overthrown, exclaimed, &ldquo;How can you be so silly? Come
      away!&rdquo; and rather roughly pulled her out of the room, when she collapsed
      entirely at the top of the stairs, and sat crying helplessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think what&rsquo;s the use of Harry&rsquo;s coming home,&rdquo; Gertrude was heard
      saying to Richard. &ldquo;It is very disagreeable;&rdquo; whereat Mary relapsed into a
      giggle, and Ethel felt frantic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard! Richard! what is to be done with Mary? She can&rsquo;t help it, I
      believe, but this is not the way to treat the mercy that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary had better go and lie down in her own room,&rdquo; said Richard, tenderly
      and gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, please! please!&rdquo; began Mary, &ldquo;I shall not see him when he comes
      back!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t behave properly when he does come,&rdquo; said Richard, &ldquo;there is
      no use in being there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember, Ritchie,&rdquo; said Ethel, thinking him severe, &ldquo;she has not been
      well this long time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary began to plead, but, with his own pretty persuasive manner, he took
      her by the hand, and drew her into his room; and when he came down, after
      an interval, it was to check Blanche, who would have gone up to interrupt
      her with queries about the perpetual blue merino. He sat down with Blanche
      on the staircase window-seat, and did not let her go till he had gently
      talked her out of flighty spirits into the soberness of thankfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel, meanwhile, had still done nothing but stray about, long for
      loneliness, find herself too unsteady to finish her letters to Flora and
      Tom; and, while she tried to make Gertrude think Harry a pleasant
      acquisition, she hated her own wild heart, that could not rejoice, nor
      give thanks, aright.
    </p>
    <p>
      By and by Mary came down, with her bonnet on, quite quiet now. &ldquo;I am going
      to church with Ritchie,&rdquo; she said. Ethel caught at the notion, and it
      spread through the house. Dr May, who just then came in with his two sons,
      looked at Harry, saying, &ldquo;What do you think of it? Shall we go, my boy?&rdquo;
       And Harry, as soon as he understood, declared that he should like nothing
      better. It seemed what they all needed, even Aubrey and Gertrude begged to
      come, and, when the solemn old minster was above their heads, and the
      hallowed stillness around them, the tightened sense of half-realised joy
      began to find relief in the chant of glory. The voices of the sanctuary,
      ever uplifting notes of praise, seemed to gather together and soften their
      emotions; and agitation was soothed away, and all that was oppressive and
      tumultuous gave place to sweet peace and thankfulness. Ethel dimly
      remembered the like sense of relief, when her mother had hushed her wild
      ecstasy, while sympathising with her joy. Richard could not trust his
      voice, but Mr. Wilmot offered the special thanksgiving.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry was, indeed, &ldquo;at home,&rdquo; and his tears fell fast over his book, as he
      heard his father&rsquo;s &ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; so fervent and so deep; and he gazed up and
      around, with fond and earnest looks, as thoughts and resolutions, formed
      there of old, came gathering thick upon him. And there little Gertrude
      seemed first to accept him. She whispered to her papa, as they stood up to
      go away, that it was very good in God Almighty to have sent Harry home;
      and, as they left the cloister, she slipped into Harry&rsquo;s hand a daisy from
      the grave, such a gift as she had never carried to any one else, save her
      father and Margaret, and she shrank no longer from being lifted up in his
      arms, and carried home through the twilight street.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hurried into the drawing-room, and was heard declaring that all was
      right, for Margaret was on the sofa; but he stopped short, grieved at her
      altered looks. She smiled as he stooped to kiss her, and then made him
      stand erect, and measure himself against Norman, whose height he had
      almost reached. The little curly midshipman had come back, as nurse said,
      &ldquo;a fine-growed young man,&rdquo; his rosy cheeks, brown and ruddy, and his
      countenance&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are much more like papa and Norman than I thought you would be,&rdquo; said
      Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has left his snub nose and yellow locks behind,&rdquo; said his father;
      &ldquo;though the shaggy mane seems to remain. I believe lions grow darker with
      age. So there stand June and July together again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. May walked backwards to look at them. It was good to see his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall see Flora and Tom to-morrow!&rdquo; said Harry, after nodding with
      satisfaction, as they all took their wonted places.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going!&rdquo; exclaimed Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, don&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo; said Ethel; &ldquo;it is current in the nursery that he
      is going to be tried by court-martial for living with the King of the
      Cannibal Islands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aubrey says he had a desert island, with Jennings for his man Friday,&rdquo;
       said Blanche.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harry,&rdquo; said little Gertrude, who had established herself on his knee,
      &ldquo;did you really poke out the giant&rsquo;s eye with the top of a fir-tree?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who told you so, Daisy?&rdquo; was the general cry; but she became shy, and
      would not answer more than by a whisper about Aubrey, who indignantly
      declared that he never said so, only Gertrude was so foolish that she did
      not know Harry from Ulysses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think our notions are much more defined.
      Papa and Norman may know more, but we have heard almost nothing. I have
      been waiting to hear more to close up my letters to Flora and Tom. What a
      shame that has not been done!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll finish,&rdquo; said Mary, running to the side-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And tell her I&rsquo;ll be there to-morrow,&rdquo; said Harry. &ldquo;I must report myself;
      and what fun to see Flora a member of Parliament! Come with me, June; I&rsquo;ll
      be back next day. I wish you all would come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I must come with you,&rdquo; said Norman. &ldquo;I shall have to go to Oxford on
      Thursday;&rdquo; and very reluctant he looked. &ldquo;Tell Flora I am coming, Mary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you know that Flora was a married lady?&rdquo; asked Blanche, in her
      would-be grown-up manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard that from Aunt Flora. A famous lot of news I picked up there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Flora!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you not know he had been at Auckland?&rdquo; said Dr. May. &ldquo;Aunt Flora had
      to nurse him well after all he had undergone. Did you not think her very
      like mamma, Harry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma never looked half so old!&rdquo; cried Harry indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flora was five years younger!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has got her voice and way with her,&rdquo; said Harry; &ldquo;but you will soon
      see. She is coming home soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a great outcry of delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, there is some money of Uncle Arnott&rsquo;s that must be looked after, but
      he does not like the voyage, and can&rsquo;t leave his office, so perhaps Aunt
      Flora may come alone. She had a great mind to come with me, but there was
      no good berth for her in this schooner, and I could not wait for another
      chance. I can&rsquo;t think what possessed the letters not to come! She would
      not write by the first packet, because I was so ill, but we both wrote by
      the next, and I made sure you had them, or I would have written before I
      came.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words were not out of his mouth before the second post was brought in,
      and there were two letters from New Zealand! What would they not have been
      yesterday? Harry would have burned his own, but the long closely-written
      sheets were eagerly seized, as, affording the best hope of understanding
      his adventures, as it had been written at intervals from Auckland, and the
      papers, passing from one to the other, formed the text for interrogations
      on further details, though much more was gleaned incidentally in
      tete-a-tetes, by Margaret, Norman, or his father, and no one person ever
      heard the whole connectedly from Harry himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was the first you knew of the fire, Harry?&rdquo; asked Dr. May, looking
      up from the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Owen shaking me awake; and I thought it was a hoax,&rdquo; said Harry. &ldquo;But it
      was true enough, and when we got on deck, there were clouds of smoke
      coming up the main hatch-way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret&rsquo;s eyes were upon him, and her lips formed the question, &ldquo;And he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He met us, and told us to be steady&mdash;but there was little need for
      that! Every man there was as cool and collected as if it had been no more
      than the cook&rsquo;s stove&mdash;and we should have scorned to be otherwise! He
      put his hand on my shoulder and said, &lsquo;Keep by me,&rsquo; and I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there was never much hope of extinguishing the fire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; if you looked down below the forecastle it was like a furnace, and
      though the pumps were at work, it was only to gain time while the boats
      were lowered. The first lieutenant told off the men, and they went down
      the side without one word, only shaking hands with those that were left.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Harry! what were you thinking of?&rdquo; cried Blanche.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of the powder,&rdquo; said Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel thought there was more in that answer than met the ear, and that
      Harry, at least, had thought of the powder to-night at church.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Ernescliffe had the command of the second cutter. He asked to take me
      with him; I was glad enough; and Owen&mdash;he is mate, you know&mdash;went
      with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As to telling how he felt when he saw the good ship Alcestis blown to
      fragments, that was past Harry, and all but Blanche were wise enough not
      to ask. She had by way of answer, &ldquo;Very glad to be safe out of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nor was Harry willing to dwell on the subsequent days, when the unclouded
      sun had been a cruel foe; and the insufficient stores of food and water
      did, indeed, sustain life, but a life of extreme suffering. What he told
      was of the kindness that strove to save him, as the youngest, from all
      that could be spared him. &ldquo;If I dropped asleep at the bottom of the boat,
      I was sure to find some one shading me from the sun. If there was an extra
      drop of water, they wanted me to have it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me their names, Harry!&rdquo; cried Dr. May. &ldquo;If ever I meet one of them&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the storm, Harry, the storm?&rdquo; asked Blanche. &ldquo;Was that not terrible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very comfortable at first, Blanche,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;Oh, that rain!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But when it grew so very bad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We did not reck much what happened to us,&rdquo; said Harry. &ldquo;It could not be
      worse than starving. When we missed the others in the morning, most of us
      thought them the best off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary could not help coming round to kiss him, as if eyes alone were not
      enough to satisfy her that here he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. May shuddered, and went on reading, and Margaret drew Harry down to
      her, and once more by looks craved for more minute tidings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All that you can think,&rdquo; murmured Harry; &ldquo;the very life and soul of us
      all&mdash;so kind, and yet discipline as perfect as on board. But don&rsquo;t
      now, Margaret&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tone of the don&rsquo;t, the reddening cheek, liquid eye, and heaving chest,
      told enough of what the lieutenant had been to one, at least, of the
      desolate boat&rsquo;s crew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Harry, Harry! I can&rsquo;t bear it!&rdquo; exclaimed Mary. &ldquo;How long did it
      last? How did it end?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fifteen days,&rdquo; said Harry. &ldquo;It was time it should end, for all the water
      we had caught in the storm was gone&mdash;we gave the last drop to Jones,
      for we thought him dying; one&rsquo;s tongue was like a dry sponge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did it end?&rdquo; repeated Mary, in an agony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jennings saw a sail. We thought it all a fancy of weakness, but &lsquo;twas
      true enough, and they saw our signal of distress!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The vessel proved to be an American whaler, which had just parted with her
      cargo to a homeward bound ship, and was going to refit, and take in
      provisions and water at one of the Milanesian islands, before returning
      for further captures. The master was a man of the shrewd, hard
      money-making cast; but, at the price of Mr. Ernescliffe&rsquo;s chronometer, and
      of the services of the sailors, he undertook to convey them where they
      might fall in with packets bound for Australia.
    </p>
    <p>
      The distressed Alcestes at first thought themselves in paradise, but the
      vessel, built with no view, save to whales, and, with a considerable
      reminiscence of the blubber lately parted with, proved no wholesome abode,
      when overcrowded, and in the tropics! Mr. Ernescliffe&rsquo;s science,
      resolution, and constancy, had saved his men so far; but with the need for
      exertion his powers gave way, and he fell a prey to a return of the fever
      which had been his introduction to Dr. May.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There he was,&rdquo; said Harry, &ldquo;laid up in a little bit of a stifling cabin,
      just like an oven, without the possibility of a breath of air! The
      skin-flint skipper carried no medicine; the water&mdash;shocking stuff it
      was&mdash;was getting so low, that there was only a pint a day served out
      to each, and though all of us Alcestes clubbed every drop we could spare
      for him&mdash;it was bad work! Owen and I never were more glad in our
      lives than when we heard we were to cast anchor at the Loyalty Isles! Such
      a place as it was! You little know what it was to see anything green! And
      there was this isle fringed down close to the sea with cocoa-nut trees!
      And the bay as clear!&mdash;you could see every shell, and wonderful
      fishes swimming in it! Well, every one was for going ashore, and some of
      the natives swam out to us, and brought things in their canoes, but not
      many; it is not encouraged by the mission, nor by David&mdash;for those
      Yankee traders are not the most edifying society&mdash;and the crew vowed
      they were cannibals, and had eaten a man three years ago, so they all went
      ashore armed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You stayed with him,&rdquo; said Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, it was my turn, and I was glad enough to have some fresh fruit and
      water for him, but he could not take any notice of it. Did not I want you,
      papa? Well, by and by, Owen came back, in a perfect rapture with the place
      and the people, and said it was the only hope for Mr. Ernescliffe, to take
      him on shore&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you did really go amongst the cannibals!&rdquo; exclaimed Blanche.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all nonsense,&rdquo; said Harry. &ldquo;Some of them may once have been, and
      I fancy the heathens might not mind a bit of &lsquo;long pig&rsquo; still; but these
      have been converted by the Samoans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Samoans, it was further explained, are the inhabitants of the
      Navigator Islands, who, having been converted by the Church Missionary
      Society, have sent out great numbers of most active and admirable teachers
      among the scattered islands, braving martyrdom and disease, never
      shrinking from their work, and, by teaching and example, preparing the way
      for fuller doctrine than they can yet impart. A station of these devoted
      men had for some years been settled in this island, and had since been
      visited by the missions of Newcastle and New Zealand. The young chief,
      whom Harry called David, and another youth, had spent two summers under
      instruction at New Zealand, and had been baptised. They were spending the
      colder part of the year at home, and hoped shortly to be called for by the
      mission-ship to return, and resume their course of instruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Owen had come to an understanding with the chief and the Samoans, and had
      decided on landing his lieutenant, and it was accordingly done, with very
      little consciousness on the patient&rsquo;s part. Black figures, with woolly
      mop-heads, and sometimes decorated with whitewash of lime, crowded round
      to assist in the transport of the sick man through the surf; and David
      himself, in a white European garb, met his guests, with dignified manners
      that would have suited a prince of any land, and conducted them through
      the grove of palms, interspersed with white huts, to a beautiful house
      consisting of a central room, with many others opening from it, floored
      with white coral lime, and lined with soft shining mats of Samoan
      manufacture. This, Harry learned, had been erected by them in hopes of an
      English missionary taking up his abode amongst them.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were a kindly people, and had shown hospitality to other Englishmen,
      who had less appreciated it than these young officers could. They lavished
      every kindness in their power upon them, and Mr. Ernescliffe, at first,
      revived so much, that he seemed likely to recover.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the ship had completed her repairs, and was ready to sail. The two
      midshipmen thought it would be certain death to their lieutenant to bring
      him back to such an atmosphere; &ldquo;and so,&rdquo; continued Harry&rsquo;s letter to his
      father, &ldquo;I thought there was nothing for it but for me to stay with him,
      and that you would say so. I got Owen to consent, after some trouble, as
      we were sure to be fetched off one time or another. We said not a word to
      Mr. Ernescliffe, for he was only sensible now and then, so that Owen had
      the command. Owen made the skipper leave me a pistol and some powder, but
      I was ashamed David should know it, and stowed it away. As to the
      quarter-master, old Jennings, whose boy you remember we picked up at the
      Roman camp, he had not forgotten that, and when we were shaking hands and
      wishing good-bye, he leaped up, and vowed &lsquo;he would never leave the young
      gentleman that had befriended his boy, to be eaten up by them black savage
      niggers. If they made roast-pork of Mr. May, he would be eaten first,
      though he reckoned they would find him a tougher morsel.&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t think
      Owen was sorry he volunteered, and no words can tell what a blessing the
      good old fellow was to us both.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So there we stayed, and, at first, Mr. Ernescliffe seemed mending. The
      delirium went off, he could talk quite clearly and comfortably, and he
      used to lie listening, when David and I had our odd sort of talks. I
      believe, if you had been there, or we could have strengthened him any way,
      he might have got over it; but he never thought he should, and he used to
      talk to me about all of you, and said Stoneborough had been the most
      blessed spot in his life; he had never had so much of a home, and that
      sharing our grief, and knowing you, had done him great good, just when he
      might have been getting elated. I cannot recollect it all, though I tried
      hard, for Margaret&rsquo;s sake, but he said Hector would have a great deal of
      temptation, and he hoped you would be a father to him, and Norman an elder
      brother. You would not think how much he talked of Cocksmoor, about a
      church being built there, as Ethel wished, and little Daisy laying the
      first stone. I remember one night, I don&rsquo;t know whether he was quite
      himself, for he looked full at me with his eyes, that had grown so large,
      till I did not know what was coming, and he said, &lsquo;I have seen a ship
      built by a sailor&rsquo;s vow; the roof was like the timbers of a ship&mdash;that
      was right. Mind, it is so. That is the ship that bears through the waves;
      there is the anchor that enters within the veil.&rsquo; I believe that was what
      he said. I could not forget that&mdash;he looked at me so; but much more
      he said, that I dimly remember, and chiefly about poor dear Margaret. He
      bade me tell her&mdash;his own precious pearl, as he used to call her&mdash;that
      he was quite content, and believed it was best for her and him both, that
      all should be thus settled, for they did not part for ever, and he trusted&mdash;But
      I can&rsquo;t write all that.&rdquo; (There was a great tear-blot just here). &ldquo;It is
      too good to recollect anywhere but at church. I have been there to-day,
      with my uncle and aunt, and I thought I could have told it when I came
      home, but I was too tired to write then, and now I don&rsquo;t seem as if it
      could be written anyhow. When I come home, I will try to tell Margaret.
      The most part was about her; only what was better seemed to swallow that
      up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The narrative broke off here, but had been subsequently resumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For all Mr. Ernescliffe talked as I told you, he was so quiet and happy,
      that I made sure he was getting well, but Jennings did not; and there came
      an old heathen native once to see us, who asked why we did not bury him
      alive, because he got no better, and gave trouble. At last, one night&mdash;it
      was the third of August&mdash;he was very restless, and could not breathe,
      nor lie easily; I lifted him up in my arms, for he was very light and
      thin, and tried to make him more comfortable. But presently he said, &lsquo;Is
      it you, Harry? God bless you;&rsquo; and, in a minute, I knew he was dead. You
      will tell Margaret all about it. I don&rsquo;t think she can love him more than
      I did; and she did not half know him, for she never saw him on board, nor
      in all that dreadful time, nor in his illness. She will never know what
      she has lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was another break here, and the story was continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We buried him the next day, where one could see the sea, close under the
      great palm, where David hopes to have a church one of these days. David
      helped us, and said the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer and the Glory with us there. I
      little thought, when I used to grumble at my two verses of the psalms
      every day, when I should want the ninetieth, or how glad I should be to
      know so many by heart, for they were such a comfort to Mr. Ernescliffe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;David got us a nice bit of wood, and Jennings carved the cross, and his
      name, and all about him. I should have liked to have done it, but I
      knocked up after that. Jennings thinks I had a sun-stroke. I don&rsquo;t know,
      but my head was so bad, whenever I moved, that I thought only Jennings
      would ever have come to tell you about it. Jennings looked after me as if
      I had been his own son; and there was David too, as kind as if he had been
      Richard himself&mdash;always sitting by, to bathe my forehead, or, when I
      was a little better, to talk to me, and ask me questions about his
      Christian teaching. You must not think of him like a savage, for he is my
      friend, and a far more perfect gentleman than I ever saw any one, but you,
      papa, holding the command over his people so easily and courteously, and
      then coming to me with little easy first questions about the Belief, and
      such things, like what we used to ask mamma. He liked nothing so well as
      for me to tell him about King David; and we had learned a good deal of
      each other&rsquo;s languages by that time. The notion of his heart&mdash;like
      Cocksmoor to Ethel&mdash;is to get a real English mission, and have all
      his people Christians. Ethel talked of good kings being Davids to their
      line; I think that is what he will be, if he lives; but those islanders
      have been dying off since Europeans came among them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Harry&rsquo;s letter could not tell what he confessed, one night, to his
      father, the next time he was out with him by starlight, how desolate he
      had been, and how he had yearned after his home, and, one evening, he had
      been utterly overcome by illness and loneliness, and had cried most
      bitterly and uncontrollably; and, though Jennings thought it was for his
      friend&rsquo;s death, it really was homesickness, and the thought of his father
      and Mary. Jennings had helped him out to the entrance of the hut, that the
      cool night air might refresh his burning brow. Orion shone clear and
      bright, and brought back the night when they had chosen the starry hunter
      as his friend. &ldquo;It seemed,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;as if you all were looking at me,
      and smiling to me in the stars. And there was the Southern Cross upright,
      which was like the minster to me; and I recollected it was Sunday morning
      at home, and knew you would be thinking about me. I was so glad you had
      let me be confirmed, and be with you that last Sunday, papa, for it seemed
      to join me on so much the more; and when I thought of the words in church,
      they seemed, somehow, to float on me so much more than ever before, and it
      was like the minster, and your voice. I should not have minded dying so
      much after that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At last, Harry&rsquo;s Black Prince had hurried into the hut with the tidings
      that his English father&rsquo;s ship was in the bay, and soon English voices
      again sounded in his ears, bringing the forlorn boy such warmth of
      kindness that he could hardly believe himself a mere stranger. If Alan
      could but have shared the joy with him!
    </p>
    <p>
      He was carried down to the boat in the cool of the evening, and paused on
      the way, for a last farewell to the lonely grave under the palm tree-one
      of the many sailors&rsquo; graves scattered from the tropics to the poles, and
      which might be the first seed in a &ldquo;God&rsquo;s acre&rdquo; to that island, becoming
      what the graves of holy men of old are to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      A short space more of kind care from his new friends and his Christian
      chief, and Harry awoke from a feverish doze at sounds that seemed so like
      a dream of home, that he was unwilling to break them by rousing himself;
      but they approved themselves as real, and he found himself in the embrace
      of his mother&rsquo;s sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      And here Mrs. Arnott&rsquo;s story began, of the note that reached her in the
      early morning with tidings that her nephew had been picked up by the
      mission-ship, and how she and her husband had hastened at once on board.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They sent me below to see a hero,&rdquo; she wrote. &ldquo;What I saw was a scarecrow
      sort of likeness of you, dear Richard; but, when he opened his eyes, there
      was our Maggie smiling at me. I suppose he would not forgive me for
      telling how he sobbed and cried, when he had his arms round my neck, and
      his poor aching head on my shoulder. Poor fellow, he was very weak, and I
      believe he felt, for the moment, as if he had found his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We brought him home with us, but when the next mail went, the fever was
      still so high, that I thought it would be only alarm to you to write, and
      I had not half a story either, though you may guess how proud I was of my
      nephew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harry&rsquo;s troubles were all over from that time. He had thenceforth to
      recover under his aunt&rsquo;s motherly care, while talking endlessly over the
      home that she loved almost as well as he did. He was well more quickly
      than she had ventured to hope, and nothing could check his impatience to
      reach his home, not even the hopes of having his aunt for a companion. The
      very happiness he enjoyed with her only made him long the more ardently to
      be with his own family; and he had taken his leave of her, and of his dear
      David, and sailed by the first packet leaving Auckland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never knew what the old Great Bear was to me till I saw him again!&rdquo;
       said Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was late when the elders had finished all that was to be heard at
      present, and the clock reminded them that they must part.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you go to-morrow?&rdquo; sighed Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must. Jennings has to go on to Portsmouth, and see after his son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, let me see Jennings!&rdquo; exclaimed Margaret. &ldquo;May I not, papa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard, who had been making friends with Jennings, whenever he had not
      been needed by his sisters that afternoon, went to fetch him from the
      kitchen, where all the servants, and all their particular friends, were
      listening to the yarn that made them hold their heads higher, as belonging
      to Master Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry stepped forward, met Jennings, and said, aside, &ldquo;My sister,
      Jennings; my sister that you have heard of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. May had already seen the sailor, but he could not help addressing him
      again. &ldquo;Come in; come in, and see my boy among us all. Without you, we
      never should have had him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make him come to me,&rdquo; said Margaret breathlessly, as the embarrassed
      sailor stood, sleeking down his hair; and, when he had advanced to her
      couch, she looked up in his face, and put her hand into his great brown
      one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not help saying thank you,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. May, sir!&rdquo; cried Jennings, almost crying, and looking round for
      Harry, as a sort of protector&mdash;&ldquo;tell them, sir, please, it was only
      my duty&mdash;I could not do no less, and you knows it, sir,&rdquo; as if Harry
      had been making an accusation against him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We know you could not,&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;and that is what we would thank
      you for, if we could. I know he&mdash;Mr. Ernescliffe&mdash;must have been
      much more at rest for leaving my brother with so kind a friend, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please, miss, don&rsquo;t say no more about it. Mr. Ernescliffe was as fine an
      officer as ever stepped a quarter-deck, and Mr. May here won&rsquo;t fall short
      of him; and was I to be after leaving the like of them to the mercy of the
      black fellows&mdash;that was not so bad neither? If it had only pleased
      God that we had brought them both back to you, miss; but, you see, a man
      can&rsquo;t be everything at once, and Mr. Ernescliffe was not so stout as his
      heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did everything, we know&mdash;&rdquo; began Dr. May.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Twas a real pleasure,&rdquo; said Jennings hastily, &ldquo;for two such real
      gentlemen as they was. Mr. May, sir, I beg your pardon if I say it to your
      face, never flinched, nor spoke a word of complaint, through it all; and,
      as to the other&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Margaret cannot bear this,&rdquo; said Richard, coming near. &ldquo;It is too much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sailor shook his head, and was retreating, but Margaret signed him to
      come near again, and grasped his hand. Harry followed him out of the room,
      to arrange their journey, and presently returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says he is glad he has seen Margaret; he says she is the right sort of
      stuff for Mr. Ernescliffe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harry had not intended Margaret to hear, but she caught the words, smiled
      radiantly, and whispered, &ldquo;I wish I may be!&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER XVIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Margaret had borne the meeting much too well for her own good, and a
      wakeful night of palpitation was the consequence; but she would not allow
      any one to take it to heart, and declared that she should be ready to
      enjoy Harry by the time he should return, and meantime, she should dwell
      on the delight of his meeting Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one had rested too soundly that night, and Dr. May had not been able to
      help looking in at his sleeping boy at five in the morning, to certify
      himself that he had not only figured his present bliss to himself, in his
      ten minutes&rsquo; dream. And looking in again at half-past seven, he found
      Harry half dressed, with his arm round Mary; laughing, almost sobbing,
      over the treasures in his cupboard, which he had newly discovered in their
      fresh order.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. May looked like a new man that morning, with his brightened eye and
      bearing, as if there were a well-spring of joy within him, ready to brim
      over at once in tear and in smile, and finding an outlet in the praise and
      thanksgiving that his spirit chanted, and his face expressed, and in that
      sunny genial benevolence that must make all share his joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was going to run over half the town&mdash;every one would like to hear
      it from him; Ethel and Mary must go to the rest&mdash;the old women in the
      almshouses, where lived an old cook who used to be fond of Harry&mdash;they
      should have a feast; all who were well enough in the hospital should have
      a tea-drinking; Dr. Hoxton had already granted a holiday to the school;
      every boy with whom they had any connection should come to dinner, and
      Edward Anderson should be asked to meet Harry on his return, because, poor
      fellow, he was so improved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. May was in such a transport of kind-hearted schemes, that he was not
      easily made to hear that Harry had not a sixpence wherewith to reach
      London.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel, meanwhile, was standing beside her brother tendering to him some
      gold, as his last quarter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you get it, Ethel? do you keep the purse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but papa took Cocksmoor in your stead, when&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, Ethel,&rdquo; said Harry; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want it. Have I not all my pay and
      allowance for the whole time I was dead? And as to robbing Cocksmoor&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, keep it, Ethel,&rdquo; said her father; &ldquo;do you think I would take it now,
      when if there were a thank-offering in the world.&mdash;And, by the bye,
      your Cocksmoor children must have something to remember this by&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Every one could have envied Norman, for travelling to London with Harry,
      but that he must proceed to Oxford in two days, when Harry would return to
      them. The station-master, thinking he could not do enough for the returned
      mariner, put the two brothers into the coupe, as if they had been a bridal
      couple, and they were very glad of the privacy, having, as yet, hardly
      spoken to each other, when Harry&rsquo;s attention was dispersed among so many.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norman asked many questions about the mission work in the southern
      hemisphere, and ended by telling his brother of his design, which met with
      Harry&rsquo;s hearty approbation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, old June. There&rsquo;s nothing they want so much, as such as
      you. How glad my aunt will be! Perhaps you will see David! Oh, if you were
      to go out to the Loyalty group!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very possibly I might,&rdquo; said Norman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell them you are my brother, and how they will receive you! I can see
      the mop-heads they will dress in honour of you, and what a feast of pork
      and yams you will have to eat! But there is plenty of work among the
      Maoris for you&mdash;they want a clergyman terribly at the next village to
      my uncle&rsquo;s place. I say, Norman, it will go hard if I don&rsquo;t get a ship
      bound for the Pacific, and come and see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall reckon on you. That is, if I have not to stay to help my father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure,&rdquo; exclaimed Harry; &ldquo;I thought you would have stayed at home,
      and married little Miss Rivers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus broadly and boyishly did he plunge into that most tender subject,
      making his brother start and wince, as if he had touched a wound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; he cried, almost angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! you used to seem very much smitten, but so, to be sure, were some
      of the Alcestes with the young ladies at Valparaiso. How we used to roast
      Owen about that Spanish Donna, and he was as bad at Sydney about the young
      lady whose father, we told him, was a convict, though he kept such a swell
      carriage. He had no peace about his father-in-law, the house-breaker!
      Don&rsquo;t I remember how you pinched her hand the night you were righted!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know nothing about it,&rdquo; said Norman shortly. &ldquo;She is far beyond my
      reach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fine lady? Ha! Well, I should have thought you as good as Flora any
      day,&rdquo; said Harry indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is what she always was,&rdquo; said Norman, anxious to silence him; &ldquo;but it
      is unreasonable to think of it. She is all but engaged to Sir Henry
      Walkinghame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Walkinghame!&rdquo; cried the volatile sailor. &ldquo;I have half a mind to send in
      my name to Flora as Miss Walkinghame!&rdquo; and he laughed heartily over that
      adventure, ending, however, with a sigh, as he said, &ldquo;It had nearly cost
      me a great deal! But tell me, Norman, how has that Meta, as they called
      her, turned out? I never saw anything prettier or nicer than she was that
      day of the Roman encampment, and I should be sorry if that fine
      fashionable aunt of hers, had made her stuck-up and disdainful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No such thing,&rdquo; said Norman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; said Harry to himself, &ldquo;I see how it is! She has gone and made poor
      old June unhappy, with her scornful airs&mdash;a little impertinent puss!&mdash;I
      wonder Flora does not teach her better manners.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norman, meanwhile, as the train sped over roofs, and among chimneys, was
      reproaching himself for running into the fascination of her presence, and
      then recollecting that her situation, as well as his destiny, both
      guaranteed that they could meet only as friendly connections.
    </p>
    <p>
      No carriage awaited them at the station, which surprised Norman, till he
      recollected that the horses had probably been out all day, and it was
      eight o&rsquo;clock. Going to Park Lane in a cab, the brothers were further
      surprised to find themselves evidently not expected. The butler came to
      speak to them, saying that Mr. and Mrs. Rivers were gone out to dinner,
      but would return, probably, at about eleven o&rsquo;clock. He conducted them
      upstairs, Harry following his brother, in towering vexation and
      disappointment, trying to make him turn to hear that they would go
      directly&mdash;home&mdash;to Eton&mdash;anywhere&mdash;why would he go in
      at all?
    </p>
    <p>
      The door was opened, Mr. May was announced, and they were in a silk-lined
      boudoir, where a little slender figure in black started up, and came
      forward with outstretched hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Norman!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;how are you? Are you come on your way to Oxford?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has not Flora had Mary&rsquo;s letter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she said she had one. She was keeping it till she had time to read
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke, Meta had given her hand to Harry, as it was evidently
      expected; she raised her eyes to his face, and said, smiling&rsquo; and
      blushing, &ldquo;I am sure I ought to know you, but I am afraid I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look again,&rdquo; said Norman. &ldquo;See if you have ever seen him before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laughing, glancing, and casting down her eyes, she raised them with a
      sudden start of joy, but colouring more deeply, said, &ldquo;Indeed, I cannot
      remember. I dare say I ought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you see a likeness,&rdquo; said Norman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I see,&rdquo; she answered, faltering; but perceiving how bright were
      the looks of both, &ldquo;No? Impossible! Yes, it is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is,&rdquo; said both brothers with one voice. She clasped her hands,
      absolutely bounded with transport, then grasped both Harry&rsquo;s hands, and
      then Norman&rsquo;s, her whole countenance radiant with joy and sympathy beyond
      expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear, dear Dr. May!&rdquo; was her first exclamation. &ldquo;Oh, how happy you must
      all be! And Margaret?&rdquo; She looked up at Norman, and came nearer. &ldquo;Is not
      Mr. Ernescliffe come?&rdquo; she asked softly, and trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; was the low answer, which Harry could not bear to hear, and
      therefore walked to the window. &ldquo;No, Meta, but Margaret is much comforted
      about him. He died in great peace&mdash;in his arms&rdquo;&mdash;as he signed
      towards his brother. And as Harry continued to gaze out on the stars of
      gas on the opposite side of the park, he was able to add a few of the
      particulars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meta&rsquo;s eyes glistened with tears, as she said, &ldquo;Perhaps it would have been
      too perfect if he had come; but oh, Norman! how good she is to bear it so
      patiently! And how gloriously he behaved! How can we make enough of him!
      And Flora out! how sorry she will be!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she never opened Mary&rsquo;s letter,&rdquo; said Harry, coming back to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She little thought what it contained,&rdquo; said Meta. &ldquo;Mary&rsquo;s letters are apt
      to bear keeping, you know, and she was so busy, that she laid it aside for
      a treat after the day&rsquo;s work. But there! inhospitable wretch that I am!
      you have had no dinner!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A refection of tea and cold meat was preferred, and in her own pretty
      manner Meta lavished her welcomes, trying to cover any pain given by
      Flora&rsquo;s neglect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes her so busy?&rdquo; asked Harry, looking round on the beautifully
      furnished apartment, which, to many eyes besides those fresh from a
      Milanesian hut, might have seemed a paradise of luxurious ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what an important lady you have for a sister,&rdquo; said Meta
      merrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But tell me, what can she have to do? I thought you London ladies had
      nothing to do, but to sit with your hands before you entertaining
      company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meta laughed heartily. &ldquo;Shall I begin at the beginning? I&rsquo;ll describe
      to-day then, and you must understand that this is what Tom would call a
      mild specimen&mdash;only one evening engagement. Though, perhaps, I ought
      to start from last night at twelve o&rsquo;clock, when she was at the Austrian
      Ambassador&rsquo;s ball, and came home at two; but she was up by eight&mdash;she
      always manages to get through her housekeeping matters before breakfast.
      At nine, breakfast, and baby&mdash;by the bye, you have never inquired for
      our niece.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not come to believe in her yet,&rdquo; said Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seeing is believing,&rdquo; said Meta; &ldquo;but no, I won&rsquo;t take an unfair
      advantage over her mamma; and she will be fast asleep; I never knew a
      child sleep as she does. So to go on with our day. The papers come, and
      Miss Leonora is given over to me; for you must know we are wonderful
      politicians. Flora studies all the debates till George finds out what he
      has heard in the House, and baby and I profit. Baby goes out walking, and
      the post comes. Flora always goes to the study with George, and writes,
      and does all sorts of things for him. She is the most useful wife in the
      world. At twelve, we had our singing lesson&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Singing lesson!&rdquo; exclaimed Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you know she has a pretty voice, and she is glad to cultivate it. It
      is very useful at parties, but it takes up a great deal of time, and with
      all I can do to save her in note-writing, the morning is gone directly.
      After luncheon, she had to ride with George, and came back in a hurry to
      make some canvassing calls about the orphan asylum, and Miss Bracy&rsquo;s
      sister. If we get her in at all, it will be Flora&rsquo;s diplomacy. And there
      was shopping to do, and when we came in hoping for time for our letters,
      there were the Walkinghames, who stayed a long time, so that Flora could
      only despatch the most important notes, before George came in and wanted
      her. She was reading something for him all the time she was dressing, but,
      as I say, this is quite a quiet day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; cried Harry, with a gesture of oppression, &ldquo;it sounds harder than
      cleaning knives, like Aunt Flora! And what is an unquiet day like?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will see, for we have a great evening party to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you always stay at home?&rdquo; asked Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not always, but I do not go to large parties or balls this year,&rdquo; said
      Meta, glancing at her deep mourning; &ldquo;I am very glad of a little time at
      home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you don&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! it is very pleasant,&rdquo; said Meta. &ldquo;It is so entertaining when we
      talk it over afterwards, and I like to hear how Flora is admired, and
      called the beauty of the season. I tell George, and we do so gloat over it
      together! There was an old French marquis the other night, a dear old man,
      quite of the ancien regime, who said she was exactly like the portraits of
      Madame de Maintenon, and produced a beautiful miniature on a snuff-box,
      positively like that very pretty form of face of hers. The old man even
      declared that Mistress Rivers was worthy to be a Frenchwoman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to kick him!&rdquo; amiably responded Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you won&rsquo;t to-morrow! But don&rsquo;t let us waste our time over this; I
      want so much to hear about New Zealand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meta was well read in Australasian literature, and drew out a great deal
      more information from Harry than Norman had yet heard. She made him talk
      about the Maori pah near his uncle&rsquo;s farm, where the Sunday services were
      conducted by an old gentleman tattooed elegantly in the face, but dressed
      like an English clergyman; and tell of his aunt&rsquo;s troubles about the
      younger generation, whom their elders, though Christians themselves, could
      not educate, and who she feared would relapse into heathenism, for want of
      instruction, though with excellent dispositions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How glad you must be that you are likely to go!&rdquo; exclaimed Meta to
      Norman, who had sat silently listening.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sound of the door bell was the first intimation that Harry&rsquo;s histories
      had occupied them until long past twelve o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, then!&rdquo; cried Meta, springing forward, as if intending to meet Flora
      with the tidings, but checking herself, as if she ought not to be the
      first. There was a pause. Flora was hearing downstairs that Mr. Norman May
      and another gentleman had arrived, and, while vexed at her own omission,
      and annoyed at Norman&rsquo;s bringing friends without waiting for permission,
      she was yet prepared to be courteous and amiable. She entered in her rich
      black watered silk, deeply trimmed with lace, and with silver ornaments in
      her dark hair, so graceful and distinguished-looking, that Harry stood
      suspended, hesitating, for an instant, whether he beheld his own sister,
      especially as she made a dignified inclination towards him, offering her
      hand to Norman, as she said, &ldquo;Meta has told you&mdash;&rdquo; But there she
      broke off, exclaiming, &ldquo;Ha! is it possible! No, surely it cannot be&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Walkinghame?&rdquo; said the sailor, who had felt at home with her at the
      first word, and she flew into his great rough arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harry! this is dear Harry! our own dear sailor come back,&rdquo; cried she, as
      her husband stood astonished; and, springing towards him, she put Harry&rsquo;s
      hand into his, &ldquo;My brother Harry! our dear lost one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your&mdash;brother&mdash;Harry,&rdquo; slowly pronounced George, as he
      instinctively gave the grasp of greeting&mdash;&ldquo;your brother that was
      lost? Upon my word,&rdquo; as the matter dawned fully on him, and he became
      eager, &ldquo;I am very glad to see you. I never was more rejoiced in my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did you come? Have you been at home?&rdquo; asked Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came home yesterday&mdash;Mary wrote to tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor dear old Mary! There&rsquo;s a lesson against taking a letter on trust. I
      thought it would be all Cocksmoor, and would wait for a quiet moment! How
      good to come to me so soon, you dear old shipwrecked mariner!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was forced to come to report myself,&rdquo; said Harry, &ldquo;or I could not have
      come away from my father so soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The usual questions and their sad answers ensued, and while Flora talked
      to Harry, fondly holding his hand, Norman and Meta explained the history
      to George, who no sooner comprehended it, that he opined it must have been
      a horrid nuisance, and that Harry was a gallant fellow; then striking him
      over the shoulder, welcomed him home with all his kind heart, told him he
      was proud to receive him, and falling into a state of rapturous
      hospitality, rang the bell, and wanted to order all sorts of eatables and
      drinkables, but was sadly baffled to find him already satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was more open joy than even at home, and Flora was supremely happy
      as she sat between her brothers, listening and inquiring till far past one
      o&rsquo;clock, when she perceived poor George dozing off, awakened every now and
      then by a great nod, and casting a wishful glance of resigned
      remonstrance, as if to appeal against sitting up all night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The meeting at breakfast was a renewal of pleasure. Flora was proud and
      happy in showing off her little girl, a model baby, as she called her, a
      perfect doll for quietness, so that she could be brought in at family
      prayers; &ldquo;and,&rdquo; said Flora, &ldquo;I am the more glad that she keeps no one
      away, because we can only have evening prayers on Sunday. It is a serious
      thing to arrange for such a household.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is equal to anything,&rdquo; said George.
    </p>
    <p>
      The long file of servants marched in, George read sonorously, and Flora
      rose from her knees, highly satisfied at the impression produced upon her
      brothers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like to have the baby with us at breakfast,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;it is the only
      time of day when we can be sure of seeing anything of her, and I like her
      nurse to have some respite. Do you think her grown, Norman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not very much,&rdquo; said Norman, who thought her more inanimate and like a
      pretty little waxen toy, than when he had last seen her. &ldquo;Is she not
      rather pale?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;London makes children pale. I shall soon take her home to acquire a
      little colour. You must know Sir Henry has bitten us with his yachting
      tastes, and as soon as we can leave London, we are going to spend six
      weeks with the Walkinghames at Ryde, and rival you, Harry. I think Miss
      Leonora will be better at home, so we must leave her there. Lodgings and
      irregularities don&rsquo;t suit people of her age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does home mean Stoneborough?&rdquo; asked Norman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Old nurse has one of her deadly prejudices against Preston, and I
      would not be responsible for the consequences of shutting them up in the
      same nursery. Margaret would be distracted between them. No, miss, you
      shall make her a visit every day, and be fondled by your grandpapa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      George began a conversation with Harry on nautical matters, and Norman
      tried to discover how Meta liked the yachting project, and found her
      prepared to think it charming. Hopes were expressed that Harry might be at
      Portsmouth, and a quantity of gay scheming ensued, with reiterations of
      the name of Walkinghame; while Norman had a sense of being wrapped in some
      gray mist, excluding him from participation in their enjoyments, and
      condemned his own temper as frivolous for being thus excited to
      discontent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, he heard George insisting that he and Harry should return in
      time for the evening party; and, on beginning to refuse, was amazed to
      find Harry&rsquo;s only objection was on the score of lack of uniform.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you in one, sir,&rdquo; said Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have only one coat in the world, besides this,&rdquo; continued Harry, &ldquo;and
      that is all over tar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George will see to that,&rdquo; said Flora. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think you would be
      welcome in matting, with an orange cowry round your neck?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norman, however, took a private opportunity of asking Harry if he was
      aware of what he was undertaking, and what kind of people they should
      meet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All English people behave much the same in a room,&rdquo; said Harry, as if all
      society, provided it was not cannibal, were alike to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have thought you would prefer finding out Forder in his
      chambers, or going to one of the theatres.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you please,&rdquo; said Harry; &ldquo;but Flora seems to want us, and I should
      rather like to see what sort of company she keeps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Since Harry was impervious to shyness, Norman submitted, and George took
      them to a wonder-worker in cloth, who undertook that full equipments
      should await the young gentleman. Harry next despatched his business at
      the Admiralty, and was made very happy by tidings of his friend Owen&rsquo;s
      safe arrival in America.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thence the brothers went to Eton, where home letters had been more
      regarded; and Dr. May having written to secure a holiday for the objects
      of their visit, they were met at the station by the two boys. Hector&rsquo;s red
      face and prominent light eyebrows were instantly recognised; but, as to
      Tom, Harry could hardly believe that the little, dusty, round-backed grub
      be had left had been transformed into the well-made gentlemanlike lad
      before him, peculiarly trim and accurate in dress, even to the extent of
      as much foppery as Eton taste permitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes had not passed before Tom, taking a survey of the newcomer,
      began to exclaim at Norman, for letting him go about such a figure; and,
      before they knew what was doing, they had all been conducted into the shop
      of the &ldquo;only living man who knew how to cut hair.&rdquo; Laughing and
      good-natured, Harry believed his hair was &ldquo;rather long,&rdquo; allowed himself
      to be seated, and to be divested of a huge superfluous mass of sun-dried
      curls, which Tom, particularly resenting that &ldquo;rather long,&rdquo; kept on
      taking up, and unrolling from their tight rings, to measure the number of
      inches.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is better,&rdquo; said he, as they issued from the shop; &ldquo;but, as to that
      coat of yours, the rogue who made it should never make another. Where
      could you have picked it up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At a shop at Auckland,&rdquo; said Harry, much amused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kept by a savage?&rdquo; said Tom, to whom it was no laughing matter. &ldquo;See that
      seam!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have done, May!&rdquo; exclaimed Hector. &ldquo;He will think you a tailor&rsquo;s
      apprentice!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or worse,&rdquo; said Norman. &ldquo;Rivers&rsquo;s tailor kept all strictures to himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom muttered that he only wanted Harry to be fit to be seen by the
      fellows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fellows are not such asses as you!&rdquo; cried Hector. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t deserve
      that he should come to see you. If my&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There poor Hector broke off. If his own only brother had been walking
      beside him, how would he not have felt? They had reached their tutor&rsquo;s
      house, and, opening his own door, he made an imploring sign to Harry to
      enter with him. On the table lay a letter from Margaret, and another which
      Harry had written to him from Auckland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Harry, you were with him,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;tell me all about him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he established himself, with his face hidden on the table, uttering
      nothing, except, &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; whenever Harry&rsquo;s voice failed in the narration.
      When something was said of &ldquo;all for the best,&rdquo; he burst out, &ldquo;He might say
      so. I suppose one ought to think so. But is not it hard, when I had nobody
      but him? And there was Maplewood; and I might have been so happy there,
      with him and Margaret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say nothing could have made Margaret well,&rdquo; said Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care; he would have married her all the same, and we should have
      made her so happy at Maplewood. I hate the place! I wish it were at
      Jericho!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are captain of the ship now,&rdquo; said Harry, &ldquo;and you must make the best
      of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t. It will never be home. Home is with Margaret, and the rest of
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So Alan said he hoped you would make it; and you are just like one of us,
      you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of that, when Captain Gordon will not let me go near you.
      Taking me to that abominable Maplewood last Easter, with half the house
      shut up, and all horrid! And he is as dry as a stick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The captain!&rdquo; cried Harry angrily. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not a better captain to sail
      with in the whole navy, and your brother would be the first to tell you
      so! I&rsquo;m not discharged yet. Hector&mdash;you had better look out what you
      say!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe he is the best to sail with, but that is not being the best to live
      with,&rdquo; said the heir of Maplewood disconsolately. &ldquo;Alan himself always
      said he never knew what home was, till he got to your father and
      Margaret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So will you,&rdquo; said Harry; &ldquo;why, my father is your master, or whatever you
      may call it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Captain Gordon is my guardian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! what&rsquo;s become of the will then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will?&rdquo; cried Hector. &ldquo;Did Alan make one after all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay. At Valparaiso, he had a touch of fever; I went ashore to nurse him,
      to a merchant&rsquo;s, who took us in for love of our Scottish blood. Mr.
      Ernescliffe made a will there, and left it in his charge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think he made Dr. May my guardian?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He asked me whether I thought he would dislike it, and I told him, no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; cried Hector. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s like dear old Alan! I shall get back
      to the doctor and Margaret after all. Mind you write to the captain,
      Harry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hector was quite inspirited and ready to return to the others, but Harry
      paused to express a hope that he did not let Tom make such a fool of
      himself as he had done to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not he,&rdquo; said Hector. &ldquo;He is liked as much as any one in the house&mdash;he
      has been five times sent up for good. See there in the Eton list! He is a
      real clever fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, but what&rsquo;s the good of all that, if you let him be a puppy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;ll be cured. A fellow that has been a sloven always is a puppy for
      a bit,&rdquo; said Hector philosophically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norman was meantime taking Tom to task for these same airs, and, hearing
      it was from the desire to see his brother respectable&mdash;Stoneborough
      men never cared for what they looked like, and he must have Harry do
      himself credit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need not fear,&rdquo; said Norman. &ldquo;He did not require Eton to make him a
      gentleman. How now? Why, Tom, old man, you are not taking that to heart?
      That&rsquo;s all over long ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For that black spot in his life had never passed out of the lad&rsquo;s memory,
      and it might be from the lurking want of self-respect that there was about
      him so much of self-assertion, in attention to trifles. He was very
      reserved, and no one except Norman had ever found the way to anything like
      confidence, and Norman had vexed him by the proposal he had made in the
      holidays.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made no answer, but stood looking at Norman with an odd undecided gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what now, old fellow?&rdquo; said Norman, half fearing &ldquo;that&rdquo; might not
      be absolutely over. &ldquo;One would think you were not glad to see Harry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose he has made you all the more set upon that mad notion of
      yours,&rdquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far as making me feel that that part of the world has a strong claim
      on us,&rdquo; replied Norman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you don&rsquo;t look as if you found your pleasure in it,&rdquo; cried Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pleasure is not what I seek,&rdquo; said Norman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter with you?&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;You said I did not seem rejoiced&mdash;you
      look worse, I am sure.&rdquo; Tom put his arm on Norman&rsquo;s shoulder, and looked
      solicitously at him&mdash;demonstrations of affection very rare with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder which would really make you happiest, to have your own way, and
      go to these black villains&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember, that but for others who have done so, Harry&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw,&rdquo; said Tom, rubbing some invisible dust from his coat sleeve. &ldquo;If
      it would keep you at home, I would say I never would hear of doctoring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you had said so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of my coming here, if I&rsquo;m to be a country doctor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have told you I do not mean to victimise you. If you have a distaste to
      it, there&rsquo;s an end of it&mdash;I am quite ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom gave a great sigh. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if I must, I must; I don&rsquo;t mind the
      part of it that you do. I only hate the name of it, and the being tied
      down to a country place like that, while you go out thousands of miles off
      to these savages; but if it is the only thing to content you, I wont stand
      in your way. I can&rsquo;t bear your looking disconsolate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think yourself bound, if you really dislike the profession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;It is my free choice. If it were not for horrid sick
      people, I should like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Promising! it must be confessed!
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps Tom had expected Norman to brighten at once, but it was a
      fallacious hope. The gaining his point involved no pleasant prospect, and
      his young brother&rsquo;s moody devotion to him suggested scruples whether he
      ought to exact the sacrifice, though, in his own mind, convinced that it
      was Tom&rsquo;s vocation; and knowing that would give him many of the advantages
      of an eldest son.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eton fully justified Hector&rsquo;s declaration that it would not regard the cut
      of Harry&rsquo;s coat. The hero of a lost ship and savage isle was the object of
      universal admiration and curiosity, and inestimable were the favours
      conferred by Hector and Tom in giving introductions to him, till he had
      shaken hands with half the school, and departed amid deafening cheers.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of Harry, the day had been long and heavy to Norman, and though
      he chid himself for his depression, he shrank from the sight of Meta and
      Sir Henry Walkinghame together, and was ready to plead an aching head as
      an excuse for not appearing at the evening party; but, besides that this
      might attract notice, he thought himself bound to take care of Harry in so
      new a world, where the boy must be at a great loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, old June,&rdquo; cried a voice at his door, &ldquo;are you ready?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not begun dressing yet. Will you wait?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I. The fun is beginning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norman heard the light foot scampering downstairs, and prepared to follow,
      to assume the protection of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Music sounded as Norman left his room, and he turned aside to avoid the
      stream of company flowing up the flower-decked stairs, and made his way
      into the rooms through Flora&rsquo;s boudoir. He was almost dazzled by the
      bright lights, and the gay murmurs of the brilliant throng. Young ladies
      with flowers and velvet streamers down their backs, old ladies portly and
      bejewelled, gentlemen looking civil, abounded wherever he turned his eyes.
      He could see Flora&rsquo;s graceful head bending as she received guest after
      guest, and the smile with which she answered congratulations on her
      brother&rsquo;s return; but Harry he did not so quickly perceive, and he was
      trying to discover in what corner he might have hidden himself, when Meta
      stood beside him, asking whether their Eton journey had prospered, and how
      poor Hector was feeling at Harry&rsquo;s return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Harry?&rdquo; asked Norman. &ldquo;Is he not rather out of his element?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed,&rdquo; said Meta, smiling. &ldquo;Why, he is the lion of the night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor fellow, how he must hate it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come this way, into the front room. There, look at him&mdash;is it not
      nice to see him, so perfectly simple and at his ease, neither shy nor
      elated? And what a fine-looking fellow he is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meta might well say so. The trim, well-knit, broad-chested form, the rosy
      embrowned honest face, the shining light-brown curly locks, the dancing
      well-opened blue eyes, and merry hearty smile showed to the best
      advantage, in array that even Tom would not have spurned, put on with
      naval neatness; and his attitude and manner were so full of manly ease,
      that it was no wonder that every eye rested on him with pleasure. Norman
      smiled at his own mistake, and asked who were the lady and gentleman
      conversing with him. Meta mentioned one of the most distinguished of
      English names, and shared his amusement in seeing Harry talking to them
      with the same frank unembarrassed ease as when he had that morning shaken
      hands with their son, in the capacity of Hector Ernescliffe&rsquo;s fag. No one
      present inspired him with a tithe of the awe he felt for a post-captain&mdash;it
      was simply a pleasant assembly of good-natured folks, glad to welcome home
      a battered sailor, and of pretty girls, for whom he had a sailor&rsquo;s
      admiration, but without forwardness or presumption&mdash;all in happy
      grateful simplicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you cannot dance?&rdquo; said Flora to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I!&rdquo; was Harry&rsquo;s interjection; and while she was looking round for a
      partner to whom to present him, he had turned to the young daughter of his
      new acquaintance, and had her on his arm, unconscious that George had been
      making his way to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora was somewhat uneasy, but the mother was looking on smiling, and
      expressed her delight in the young midshipman; and Mrs. Rivers, while
      listening gladly to his praises, watched heedfully, and was reassured to
      see that dancing was as natural to him as everything else; his steps were
      light as a feather, his movement all freedom and joy, without being
      boisterous, and his boyish chivalry as pretty a sight as any one could
      wish to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the rest of the world enjoyed their dances a quarter as much as did
      &ldquo;Mr. May,&rdquo; they were enviable people, and he contributed not a little to
      their pleasure, if merely by the sight of his blithe freshness and
      spirited simplicity, as well as the general sympathy with his sister&rsquo;s
      joy, and the interest in his adventures. He would have been a general
      favourite, if he had been far less personally engaging; as it was, every
      young lady was in raptures at dancing with him, and he did his best to
      dance with them all; and to try to stir up Norman, who, after Meta had
      been obliged to leave him, and go to act her share of the part of hostess,
      had disposed of himself against a wall, where he might live out the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! June! what makes you stand sentry there? Come and dance, and have
      some of the fun! Some of these girls are the nicest partners in the world.
      There&rsquo;s that Lady Alice, something with the dangling things in her hair,
      sitting down now&mdash;famous at a polka. Come along, I&rsquo;ll introduce you.
      It will do you good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing of dancing,&rdquo; said Norman, beginning to apprehend that he
      might be dragged off, as often he had been to cricket or football, and by
      much the same means.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Comes by nature, when you hear the music. Ha! what a delicious polka!
      Come along, or I must be off! She will be waiting for me, and she is the
      second prettiest girl here! Come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been trying to make something of him, Harry,&rdquo; said the ubiquitous
      Flora, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t know whether it is mauvaise honte, or headache.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see! Poor old June!&rdquo; cried Harry. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get you an ice at once, old
      fellow! Nothing like one for setting a man going!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before Norman could protest, Harry had flown off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flora,&rdquo; asked Norman, &ldquo;is&mdash;are the Walkinghames here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Don&rsquo;t you see Sir Henry. That fine-looking man with the black
      moustache. I want you to know him. He is a great admirer of your prize
      poem and of Dr. Spencer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harry returning, administered his ice, and then darted off to excuse
      himself to his partner, by explanations about his brother, whom everybody
      must have heard of, as he was the cleverest fellow living, and had written
      the best prize poem ever heard at Oxford. He firmly believed Norman a much
      greater lion than himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norman was forced to leave his friendly corner to dispose of the glass of
      his ice, and thus encountered Miss Rivers, of whom Sir Henry was asking
      questions about a beautiful collection of cameos, which Flora had laid out
      as a company trap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is Norman May,&rdquo; said Meta; &ldquo;he knows them better than I do. Do you
      remember which of these is the head of Diana, Norman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having set the two gentlemen to discuss them, she glided away on fresh
      hospitable duties, while Norman repeated the comments that he had so
      enjoyed hearing from poor Mr. Rivers, hoping he was, at least, sparing
      Meta some pain, and wondering that Flora should have risked hurting her
      feelings by exposing these treasures to the general gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Norman were wearied by Sir Henry, it was his own fault, for the baronet
      was a very agreeable person, who thought a first-class man worth
      cultivation, so that the last half-hour might have compensated for all the
      rest, if conversation were always the test.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Meta,&rdquo; cried Harry, coming up to her, &ldquo;you have not once danced! We
      are a sort of brother and sister, to be sure, but that is no hindrance, is
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Meta, smiling, &ldquo;thank you, Harry, but you must find some one
      more worthy. I do not dance this season; at least, not in public. When we
      get home, who knows what we may do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t dance! Poor little Meta! And you don&rsquo;t go out! What a pity!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had rather not work quite so hard,&rdquo; said Meta. &ldquo;Think what good fortune
      I had by staying at home last night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I declare!&rdquo; exclaimed Harry, bewitched by the beaming congratulation of
      her look, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine why Norman had said you had turned into a fine
      lady! I can&rsquo;t see a bit of it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Norman said I had turned into a fine lady!&rdquo; repeated Meta. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind! I don&rsquo;t think so; you are just like papa&rsquo;s humming-bird, as
      you always were, not a bit more of a fine lady than any girl here, and I
      am sure papa would say so. Only old June had got a bad headache, and is in
      one of his old dumps, such as I hoped he had left off. But he can&rsquo;t help
      it, poor fellow, and he will come out of it, by and by&mdash;so never
      mind. Hallo! why people are going away already. There&rsquo;s that girl without
      any one to hand her downstairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Away ran Harry, and presently the brothers and sisters gathered round the
      fire&mdash;George declaring that he was glad that nuisance was so well
      over, and Harry exclaiming, &ldquo;Well done, Flora! It was capital fun! I never
      saw a lot of prettier or more good-natured people in my life. If I am at
      home for the Stoneborough ball, I wonder whether my father will let me go
      to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This result of Harry&rsquo;s successful debut in high life struck his sister and
      Norman as so absurd that both laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter now?&rdquo; asked Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your comparing Flora&rsquo;s party to a Stoneborough ball,&rdquo; said Norman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all the same, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said Harry. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you are equally
      disgusted at both!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much you know about it,&rdquo; said Flora, patting him gaily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to
      put conceit in that lion head of yours, but you were as good as an Indian
      prince to my party. Do you know to whom you have been talking so coolly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. You see, Norman, it is just as I told you. All civilised
      people are just alike when they get into a drawing-room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harry takes large views of the Genus homo,&rdquo; Norman exerted himself to
      say. &ldquo;Being used to the black and brown species, he takes little heed of
      the lesser varieties.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is enough for him that he does not furnish the entertainment in
      another way,&rdquo; said Flora. &ldquo;But, good-night. Meta, you look tired.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XIX.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Let none, henceforward, shrink from daring dreams,
    For earnest hearts shall find their dreams fulfilled.&mdash;FOUQUE.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have it!&rdquo; began Harry, as he came down to breakfast. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how
      I came to forget it. The will was to be sent home to Mr. Mackintosh&rsquo;s
      English partner. I&rsquo;ll go and overhaul him this very morning. They won&rsquo;t
      mind my coming by a later train, when there is such a reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is his name? Where shall you find him?&rdquo; asked Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t be sure; but you&rsquo;ve a navy list of that sort of cattle, have not
      you, Flora? I&rsquo;ll hunt him up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flora supposed he meant a directory; and all possible South American
      merchants having been overlooked, and the Mackintoshes selected, he next
      required a chart of London, and wanted to attempt self-navigation, but was
      forced to accept of George&rsquo;s brougham and escort; Flora would not trust
      him otherwise; and Norman was obliged to go to Oxford at once, hurrying
      off to his train before breakfast was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora might have trusted Harry alone. George contributed no more than the
      dignity of his presence; and, indeed, would have resigned the pursuit at
      the first blunder about the firm; and still more when the right one had
      been found, but the partner proved crusty, and would not believe that any
      such document was in his hands. George was consenting to let it rest till
      Mr. Mackintosh could be written to; but Harry, outrunning his management,
      and regardless of rebuffs, fairly teased the old gentleman into a search,
      as the only means of getting rid of the troublesome sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of George&rsquo;s civil regrets at the fruitless trouble they were
      causing, forth came a bundle of papers, and forth from the bundle fell a
      packet, on which Harry pounced as he read, &ldquo;Will of Alan Halliday
      Ernescliffe, Esquire, of Maplewood, Yorkshire, Lieutenant in H. M. S.
      Alcestis,&rdquo; and, in the corner, the executors&rsquo; names, Captain John Gordon,
      of H. M. S. Alcestis; and Richard May, Esquire, M. D., Market
      Stoneborough.
    </p>
    <p>
      As if in revenge, the prudent merchant would not be induced to entrust him
      with the document, saying he could not give it up till he had heard from
      the executors, and had been certified of the death of the testator. He
      withstood both the angry gentlemen, who finally departed in a state of
      great resentment&mdash;Harry declaring that the old land-lubber would not
      believe that he was his own father&rsquo;s son; and Mr. Rivers, no less
      incensed, that the House of Commons had been insulted in his person,
      because he did not carry all before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora laughed at their story, and told them that she suspected that the
      old gentleman was in the right; and she laid plans for having Harry to
      teach them yachting at Ryde, while Harry declared he would have nothing to
      do with such trumpery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry found his home in a sort of agony of expectation, for his
      non-arrival at the time expected had made his first appearance seem like
      an unsubstantial illusion, though Dr. May, or Mary and Aubrey, had been at
      the station at the coming in of each train. Margaret had recovered the
      effects of the first shock, and the welcome was far more joyous than the
      first had been, with the mixed sensations that were now composed, and
      showed little, outwardly, but gladness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. May took Flora&rsquo;s view of the case, and declared that, if Harry had
      brought home the will, he should not have opened it without his
      co-executor. So he wrote to the captain, while Harry made the most of his
      time in learning his sisters over again. He spent a short time alone with
      Margaret every morning, patiently and gently allowing himself to be
      recalled to the sad recollections that were all the world to her. He kept
      Ethel and Mary merry with his droll desultory comments; he made Blanche
      keep up her dancing; and taught Gertrude to be a thorough little romp. As
      to Dr. May, his patients never were so well or so cheerful, till Dr.
      Spencer and Ethel suspected that the very sight of his looks brightened
      them&mdash;how could they help it? Dr. Spencer was as happy as a king in
      seeing his friend freed from the heavy weight on his spirits; and, truly,
      it was goodly to watch his perfect look of content, as he leaned on his
      lion-faced boy&rsquo;s arm, and walked down to the minster, whither it seemed to
      have become possible to go on most evenings. Good Dr. May was no musician,
      but Mr. Wilmot could not regret certain tones that now and then burst out
      in the chanting, from the very bottom of a heart that assuredly sang with
      the full melody of thankfulness, whatever the voice might do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Gordon not only wrote but came to Stoneborough, whence Harry was
      to go with him to the court-martial at Portsmouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girls wondered that, after writing with so much warmth and affection,
      both of and to Harry, he met him without any demonstration of feeling; and
      his short peremptory manner removed all surprise that poor Hector had been
      so forlorn with him at Maplewood, and turned, with all his heart, to Dr.
      May. They were especially impressed at the immediate subsidence of all
      Harry&rsquo;s noise and nonsense, as if the drawing-room had been the
      quarter-deck of the Alcestis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;Harry will not hear a single word in dispraise
      of him. I do believe he loves him with all his heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;that in a strong character, there is an exulting
      fear in looking up to a superior, in whose justice there is perfect
      reliance. It is a germ of the higher feeling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you are right,&rdquo; said Margaret; &ldquo;but it is a serious thing for a
      man to have so little sympathy with those below him. You see how Hector
      feels it, and I now understand how it told upon Alan, and how papa&rsquo;s
      warmth was like a surprise to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because Captain Gordon had to be a father to them, and that is more than
      a captain. I should not wonder if there were more similarity and
      fellow-feeling between him and Harry than there could be with either of
      them. Harry, though he has all papa&rsquo;s tenderness, is of a rougher sort
      that likes to feel itself mastered. Poor Hector! I wonder if he is to be
      given back to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know&mdash;when&mdash;whether they will find out this morning?&rdquo;
       said Margaret, catching her dress nervously, as she was moving away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I believe so. I was not to have told you, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no reason that it should do me any harm,&rdquo; said Margaret, almost
      smiling, and looking as if she was putting a restraint on something she
      wished to say. &ldquo;Go down, dear Ethel&mdash;Aubrey will be waiting for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel went down to the difficult task of hearing Aubrey&rsquo;s lessons, while
      Harry was pretending to write to Mrs. Arnott, but, in reality, teaching
      Gertrude the parts of a ship, occasionally acting mast, for her to climb.
    </p>
    <p>
      By and by Dr. May came in. &ldquo;Margaret not downstairs yet?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is dressed, but will not come down till the evening,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go to her. She will be pleased. Come up presently, Ethel. Or,
      where&rsquo;s Richard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone out,&rdquo; said Harry. &ldquo;What, is it anything left to her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The best, the best!&rdquo; said Dr. May. &ldquo;Ethel, listen&mdash;twenty thousand,
      to build and endow a church for Cocksmoor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No need to bid Ethel listen. She gave a sort of leap in her chair, then
      looked almost ready to faint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear child,&rdquo; said her father, &ldquo;This is your wish. I give you joy,
      indeed I do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel drew his arm round her, and leaned against him. &ldquo;My wish! my wish!&rdquo;
       she repeated, as if questioning the drift of the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad it is found!&rdquo; cried Harry. &ldquo;Now I know why he talked of
      Cocksmoor, and seemed to rest in planning for it. You will mind the roof
      is as he said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must talk to Dr. Spencer about that,&rdquo; said Dr. May. &ldquo;The captain
      means to leave it entirely in our hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Alan!&rdquo; exclaimed Ethel. &ldquo;My wish! Oh, yes, but how gained? Yet,
      Cocksmoor with a church! I don&rsquo;t know how to be glad enough, and yet&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall read the sentence,&rdquo; said Dr. May. &ldquo;&lsquo;In testimony of
      thankfulness for mercy vouchsafed to him here&mdash;&rsquo; poor dear boy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does the captain say?&rdquo; asked Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is rather astounded, but he owns that the estate can bear it, for old
      Halliday had saved a great deal, and there will be more before Hector
      comes of age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Hector?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we get him back. I am fellow-trustee with Captain Gordon, and as to
      personal guardianship, I fancy the captain found he could not make the boy
      happy, and thinks you no bad specimen of our training.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Famous!&rdquo; cried Harry. &ldquo;Hector will hurrah now! Is that all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Except legacies to Captain Gordon, and some Scottish relations. But poor
      Margaret ought to hear it. Ethel, don&rsquo;t be long in coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With all Ethel&rsquo;s reputation for bluntness, it was remarkable how her force
      of character made her always called for whenever there was the least dread
      of a scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned abruptly from Harry; and, going outside the window, tried to
      realise and comprehend the tidings, but all she could have time to
      discover was that Alan&rsquo;s memory was dearer to her than ever, and she was
      obliged to hasten upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father quitted the room by one door, as she entered by the other; she
      believed that it was to hide his emotion, but Margaret&rsquo;s fair wan face was
      beaming with the sweetest of congratulating smiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought so,&rdquo; she said, as Ethel came in. &ldquo;Dear Ethel, are you not
      glad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I am,&rdquo; said Ethel, putting her hands to her brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think!&rdquo; exclaimed Margaret, as if disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said Ethel, with quivering lip. &ldquo;Dear Margaret, I am
      glad&mdash;don&rsquo;t you believe I am, but somehow, it is harder to deal with
      joy than grief. It confuses one! Dear Alan&mdash;and then to have been set
      on it so long&mdash;to have prayed so for it, and to have it come in this
      way&mdash;by your&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, Ethel, had he come home, it was his great wish to have done it. He
      used to make projects when he was here, but he would not let me tell you,
      lest he should find duties at Maplewood&mdash;whereas this would have been
      his pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Alan!&rdquo; repeated Ethel. &ldquo;If you are so kind, so dear as to be glad,
      Margaret, I think I shall be so presently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret almost grudged the lack of the girlish outbreak of rejoicing
      which would once have forgotten everything in the ecstasy of the fulfilled
      vision. It did not seem to be what Alan had intended; he had figured to
      himself unmixed joy, and she wanted to see it, and something of the
      wayward impatience of weakness throbbed at her heart, as Ethel paced the
      room, and disappeared in her own curtained recess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently she came back saying, &ldquo;You are sure you are glad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be strange if I were not,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;See, Ethel, here are
      blessings springing up from what I used to think had served for nothing
      but to bring him pain and grief. I am so thankful that he could express
      his desire, and so grateful to dear Harry for bringing it to light. How
      much better it is than I ever thought it could be! He has been spared
      disappointment, and surely the good that he will have done will follow
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you?&rdquo; said Ethel sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall lie here and wait,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;I shall see the plans, and
      hear all about it, and oh!&rdquo;&mdash;her eyes lighted up&mdash;&ldquo;perhaps some
      day, I may hear the bell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard&rsquo;s tap interrupted them. &ldquo;Had he heard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have.&rdquo; The deepened colour in his cheek betrayed how much he felt, as
      he cast an anxious glance towards Margaret&mdash;an inquiring one on
      Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is so pleased,&rdquo; was all Ethel could say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought she would be,&rdquo; said Richard, approaching. &ldquo;Captain Gordon
      seemed quite vexed that no special token of remembrance was left to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret smiled in a peculiar way. &ldquo;If he only knew how glad I am there
      was not.&rdquo; And Ethel knew that the church was his token to Margaret, and
      that any &ldquo;fading frail memorial&rdquo; would have lessened the force of the
      signification.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel could speak better to her brother than to her sister. &ldquo;Oh, Richard!
      Richard! Richard!&rdquo; she cried, and a most unusual thing with both, she
      flung her arms round his neck. &ldquo;It is come at last! If it had not been for
      you, this would never have been. How little likely it seemed, that dirty
      day, when I talked wildly, and you checked me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had faith and perseverance,&rdquo; said Richard, &ldquo;or&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; said Margaret, as Ethel was about to disclaim. &ldquo;It was
      Ethel&rsquo;s steadiness that brought it before Alan&rsquo;s mind. If she had yielded
      when we almost wished it, in the time of the distress about Mrs. Green, I
      do believe that all would have died away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t keep steady&mdash;I was only crazy. You and Ritchie and Mr.
      Wilmot&mdash;&rdquo; said Ethel, half crying; then, as if unable to stay, she
      exclaimed with a sort of petulance, &ldquo;And there&rsquo;s Harry playing all sorts
      of rigs with Aubrey! I shan&rsquo;t get any more sense out of him to-day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And away she rushed to the wayfaring dust of her life of labour, to find
      Aubrey and Daisy half-way up the tulip tree, and Harry mischievously
      unwilling to help them down again, assuring her that such news deserved a
      holiday, and that she was growing a worse tartar than Miss Winter. She had
      better let the poor children alone, put on her bonnet, and come with him
      to tell Mr. Wilmot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereat Ethel was demurring, when Dr. May came forth, and declared he
      should take her himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Mr. Wilmot laboured under a great burden of gratitude, which no one
      would receive from him. Dr. May and Ethel repudiated thanks almost with
      terror; and, when he tried them with the captain, he found very doubtful
      approval of the whole measure, so that Harry alone was a ready acceptant
      of a full meed of acknowledgments for his gallant extraction of the will.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one was more obliged to him than Hector Ernescliffe, who wrote to
      Margaret that it would be very jolly to come home again, and that he was
      delighted that the captain could not hinder either that or Cocksmoor
      Church. &ldquo;And as to Maplewood, I shall not hate it so much, if that happens
      which I hope will happen.&rdquo; Of which oracular sentence, Margaret could make
      nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house of May felt more at their ease when the uncongenial captain had
      departed, although he carried off Harry with him. There was the better
      opportunity for a tea-drinking consultation with Dr. Spencer and Mr.
      Wilmot, when Margaret lay on her sofa, looking better than for months
      past, and taking the keenest interest in every arrangement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Spencer, whose bright eyes glittered at every mention of the subject,
      assumed that he was to be the architect, while Dr. May was assuring him
      that it was a maxim that no one unpaid could be trusted; and when he
      talked of beautiful German churches with pierced spires, declared that the
      building must not make too large a hole in the twenty thousand, at the
      expense of future curates, because Richard was the first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be prudent, Dick,&rdquo; said Dr. Spencer. &ldquo;Trust me not to rival the
      minster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall find work next for you there,&rdquo; said Mr. Wilmot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, we shall have May out of his family packing-box before many years are
      over his head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention it,&rdquo; said Dr. May; &ldquo;I know what I exposed myself to in
      bringing Wilmot here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Dr. Spencer, &ldquo;we shall put you in the van when we attack the
      Corporation pen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall hold by the good old cause. As if the galleries had not been
      there before you were born!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As if poor people had a right to sit in their own church!&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit, you may well say,&rdquo; said Mr. Wilmot. &ldquo;As if any one could do
      otherwise, with those ingenious traps for hindering kneeling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, I know the people must have room,&rdquo; said Dr. May, cutting
      short several further attacks which he saw impending.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you would like to build another blue gallery, blocking up another
      window, and with Richard May and Christopher Tomkins, Churchwardens, on
      it, in orange-coloured letters&mdash;the Rivers&rsquo; colours. No disrespect to
      your father, Miss May, but, as a general observation, it is a property of
      Town Councillors to be conservative only where they ought not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I brought you here to talk of building a church, not of pulling one to
      pieces.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor Dr. May, he knew it was inevitable and quite right, but his
      affectionate heart and spirit of perpetuity, which had an association
      connected with every marble cloud, green baize pew, and square-headed
      panel, anticipated tortures in the general sweep, for which his
      ecclesiastical taste and sense of propriety would not soon compensate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret spared his feelings by bringing the Cocksmoor subject back again;
      Dr. Spencer seemed to comprehend the ardour with which she pressed it on,
      as if it were very near her heart that there should be no delay. He said
      he could almost promise her that the first stone should be laid before the
      end of the summer, and she thanked him in her own warm sweet way, hoping
      that it would be while Hector and Harry were at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry soon returned, having gone through the court-martial with the utmost
      credit, been patronised by Captain Gordon in an unheard-of manner, asked
      to dine with the admiral, and promised to be quickly afloat again. Ere
      many days had passed, he was appointed to one of the finest vessels in the
      fleet, commanded by a captain to whom Captain Gordon had introduced him,
      and who &ldquo;seemed to have taken a fancy to him,&rdquo; as he said. The Bucephalus,
      now the object of his pride, was refitting, and his sisters hoped to see a
      good deal of him before he should again sail. Besides, Flora would be at
      Ryde before the end of July.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was singular that Ethel&rsquo;s vision should have been fulfilled
      simultaneously with Flora&rsquo;s having obtained a position so far beyond what
      could have been anticipated.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was evidently extremely happy and valuable, much admired and
      respected, and with full exercise for the energy and cleverness, which
      were never more gratified than by finding scope for action. Her husband
      was devotedly attached to her, and was entirely managed by her, and though
      her good judgment kept her from appearing visibly in matters not
      pertaining to her own sphere, she was, in fact, his understanding. She
      read, listened, and thought for him, imbued him with her own views, and
      composed his letters for him; ruling his affairs, both political and
      private, and undeniably making him fill a position which, without her, he
      would have left vacant; nor was there any doubt that he was far happier
      for finding himself of consequence, and being no longer left a charge upon
      his own hands. He seemed fully to suffice to her as a companion, although
      she was so far superior in power; for it was, perhaps, her nature to love
      best that which depended upon her, and gave her a sense of exercising
      protection; as she had always loved Margaret better than Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Rivers was an admirable woman.&rdquo; So every one felt, and her youthful
      beauty and success in the fashionable world made her qualities, as a wife
      and mistress of a household, the more appreciated. She never set aside her
      religious habits or principles, was an active member of various charitable
      associations, and found her experience of the Stoneborough Ladies&rsquo;
      Committee applicable among far greater names. Indeed, Lady Leonora thought
      dear Flora Rivers&rsquo;s only fault, her over-strictness, which encouraged Meta
      in the same, but there were points that Flora could not have yielded on
      any account, without failing in her own eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      She made time for everything, and though, between business and fashion,
      she seemed to undertake more than mortal could accomplish, it was all
      effected, and excellently. She did, indeed, sigh over the briefness of the
      time that she could bestow on her child or on home correspondence, and
      declared that she should rejoice in rest; but, at the same time, her
      achievements were a positive pleasure to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meta, in the meantime, had been living passively on the most affectionate
      terms with her brother and sister, and though often secretly yearning
      after the dear old father, whose darling she had been, and longing for
      power of usefulness, she took it on trust that her present lot had been
      ordered for her, and was thankful, like the bird of Dr. May&rsquo;s fable, for
      the pleasures in her path&mdash;culling sweet morals, and precious
      thoughts out of book, painting or concert, occasions for Christian
      charities in each courtesy of society, and opportunities for cheerful
      self-denial and submission, whenever any little wish was thwarted.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Norman said she had turned into a fine lady! It was a sudden and
      surprising intimation, and made a change in the usually bright and calm
      current of her thoughts. She was not aware that there had been any
      alteration in herself, and it was a revelation that set her to examine
      where she had changed&mdash;poor little thing! She was not angry, she did
      not resent the charge, she took it for granted that, coming from such a
      source, it must be true and reasonable&mdash;and what did it mean? Did
      they think her too gay, or neglectful of old friends? What had they been
      saying to Harry about her?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; thought Meta, &ldquo;I understand it. I am living a life of ease and
      uselessness, and with his higher aims and nobler purposes, he shrinks from
      the frivolities among which I am cast. I saw his saddened countenance
      among our gaieties, and I know that to deep minds there is heaviness in
      the midst of display. He withdraws from the follies that have no charms
      for him, and I&mdash;ought I to be able to help being amused? I don&rsquo;t seek
      these things, but, perhaps, I ought to avoid them more than I do. If I
      could be quite clear what is right, I should not care what effort I made.
      But I was born to be one of those who have trial of riches, and such
      blessed tasks are not my portion. But if he sees the vanities creeping
      into my heart, I should be grateful for that warning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So meditated Meta, as she copied one of her own drawings of the Grange,
      for her dear old governess, Mrs. Larpent, while each line and tint
      recalled the comments of her fond amateur father, and the scenery carried
      her home, in spite of the street sounds, and the scratching of Flora&rsquo;s
      pen, coursing over note-paper. Presently Sir Henry Walkinghame called,
      bringing a beautiful bouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Delicious,&rdquo; cried Meta. &ldquo;See, Flora, it is in good time, for those vases
      were sadly shabby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She began at once to arrange the flowers, a task that seemed what she was
      born for, and the choice roses and geraniums acquired fresh grace as she
      placed them in the slender glasses and classic vases; but Flora&rsquo;s
      discerning eyes perceived some mortification on the part of the gentleman,
      and, on his departure, playfully reproached Meta for ingratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did we not thank him? I thought I did them all due honour, actually using
      the Dresden bowl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You little wretch! quite insensible to the sentiment of the thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sentiment! One would think you had been reading about the language of
      flowers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever there was, poor Sir Henry did not mean it for the Dresden bowl
      or Bohemian glass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flora! do pray tell me whether you are in fun?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ridiculous child!&rdquo; said Flora, kissing her earnest forehead, ringing
      the bell, and gathering up her papers, as she walked out of the room, and
      gave her notes to the servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does she mean? Is it play? Oh, no, a hint would be far more like
      her. But I hope it is nonsense. He is very kind and pleasant, and I should
      not know what to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Instances of his complaisance towards herself rose before her, so as to
      excite some warmth and gratitude. Her lonely heart thrilled at the idea of
      being again the best beloved, and her energetic spirit bounded at the
      thought of being no longer condemned to a life of idle ease. Still it was
      too new a light to her to be readily accepted, after she had looked on him
      so long, merely as a familiar of the house, attentive to her, because she
      fell to his share, when Flora was occupied. She liked him, decidedly; she
      could possibly do more; but she was far more inclined to dread, than to
      desire, any disturbance of their present terms of intercourse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However,&rdquo; thought she, &ldquo;I must see my way. If he should have any such
      thing in his head, to go on as we do now would be committing myself, and I
      will not do that, unless I am sure it is right. Oh, papa, you would settle
      it for me! But I will have it out with Flora. She will find out what I
      cannot&mdash;how far he is a man for whom one ought to care. I do not
      think Norman liked him, but then Norman has so keen a sense of the
      world-touched. I suppose I am that! If any other life did but seem
      appointed for me, but one cannot tell what is thwarting providential
      leading, and if this be as good a man as&mdash;What would Ethel say? If I
      could but talk to Dr. May! But Flora I will catch, before I see him again,
      that I may know how to behave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Catching Flora was not the easiest thing in the world, among her
      multifarious occupations; but Meta was not the damsel to lose an
      opportunity for want of decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora saw what was coming, and was annoyed with herself for having given
      the alarm; but, after all, it must have come some time or other, though
      she had rather that Meta had been more involved first.
    </p>
    <p>
      It should be premised that Mrs. Rivers had no notion of the degree of
      attachment felt by her brother for Meta; she only knew that Lady Leonora
      had a general distrust of her family, and she felt it a point of honour to
      promote no dangerous meetings, and to encourage Sir Henry&mdash;a
      connection who would be most valuable, both as conferring importance upon
      George in the county, and as being himself related to persons of high
      influence, whose interest might push on her brothers. Preferment for
      Richard; promotion for Harry; nay, diplomatic appointments for Tom, came
      floating before her imagination, even while she smiled at her Alnaschar
      visions.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the tone of Meta, as she drew her almost forcibly into her room,
      showed her that she had given a great shock to her basket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flora, if you would only give me a minute, and would tell me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked Flora, not inclined to spare her blushes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whether, whether you meant anything in earnest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear little goose, did no one ever make an innocent joke in their
      lives before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was very silly of me,&rdquo; said Meta; &ldquo;but you gave me a terrible fright.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it so very terrible, poor little bird?&rdquo; said Flora, in commiseration.
      &ldquo;Well then, you may safely think of him as a man tame about the house. It
      was much prettier of you not to appropriate the flowers, as any other
      damsel would have done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really and truly think&mdash;&rdquo; began Meta; but, from the colour of
      her cheek and the timid resolution of her tone, Flora thought it safest
      not to hear the interrogation, and answered, &ldquo;I know what he comes here
      for&mdash;it is only as a refuge from his mother&rsquo;s friend, old Lady
      Drummond, who would give the world to catch him for her daughters&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      all. Put my nonsense out of your head, and be yourself, my sweet one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flora had never gone so near an untruth, as when she led Meta to believe
      this was the sole reason. But, after all, what did Flora herself know to
      the contrary?
    </p>
    <p>
      Meta recovered her ease, and Flora marked, as weeks passed on, that she
      grew more accustomed to Sir Henry&rsquo;s attentions. A little while, and she
      would find herself so far bound by the encouragement she had given, that
      she could not reject him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said George, &ldquo;when do you think of going down to take the baby
      to the Grange? She looks dull, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, I think it is hardly worth while to go down en masse,&rdquo; said
      Flora. &ldquo;These last debates may be important, and it is a bad time to quit
      one&rsquo;s post. Don&rsquo;t you think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you please&mdash;the train is a great bore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we will send the baby down the last day before we go to Ryde, with
      Preston and Butts to take care of her. We can&rsquo;t spare him to take them
      down, till we shut up the house. It is so much easier for us to go to
      Portsmouth from hence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lurking conviction was that one confidential talk with Ethel would
      cause the humming-bird to break the toils that were being wound invisibly
      round her. Ethel and her father knew nothing of the world, and were so
      unreasonable in their requirements! Meta would consult them all, and all
      her scruples would awaken, and perhaps Dr. Spencer might be interrogated
      on Sir Henry&rsquo;s life abroad, where Flora had a suspicion that gossip had
      best not be raked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not that she concealed anything positively known to her, or that she was
      not acting just as she would have done by her own child. She found herself
      happily married to one whom home notions would have rejected, and she
      believed Meta would be perfectly happy with a man of decided talent,
      honour, and unstained character, even though he should not come up to her
      father&rsquo;s or Ethel&rsquo;s standard.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Meta were to marry as they would approve, she would have far to seek
      among &ldquo;desirable connections.&rdquo; Meantime, was not Flora acting with
      exemplary judgment and self-denial?
    </p>
    <p>
      So she wrote that she could not come home; Margaret was much disappointed,
      and so was Meta, who had looked to Ethel to unravel the tangles of her
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, little miss,&rdquo; said Flora to herself; &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t talk to Ethel
      till your fate is irrevocable. Why, if I had listened to her, I should be
      thankful to be singing at Mrs. Hoxton&rsquo;s parties at this minute! and, as
      for herself, look at Norman Ogilvie! No, no, after six weeks&rsquo; yachting&mdash;moonlight,
      sea, and sympathy&mdash;I defy her to rob Sir Henry of his prize! And,
      with Meta lady of Cocksmoor, even Ethel herself must be charmed!&rdquo;

    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     We barter life for pottage, sell true bliss
     For wealth or power, for pleasure or renown;
     Thus, Esau-like, our Father&rsquo;s blessing miss,
     Then wash with fruitless tears our faded crown.

    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa, here is a message from Flora for you,&rdquo; said Margaret, holding up a
      letter; &ldquo;she wants to know whom to consult about the baby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret read&mdash;&ldquo;Will you ask papa whom I had better call in to see
      the baby. There does not seem to be anything positively amiss, but I am
      not happy about her. There is a sleepiness about her which I do not
      understand, and, when roused, she is fretful, and will not be amused.
      There is a look in her eyes which I do not like, and I should wish to have
      some advice for her. Lady Leonora recommends Mr.&mdash;, but I always
      distrust people who are very much the rage, and I shall send for no one
      without papa&rsquo;s advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see!&rdquo; said Dr. May, startled, and holding out his hand for the
      letter. &ldquo;A look about the eyes! I shall go up and see her myself. Why has
      not she brought her home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would have been far better,&rdquo; said Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sleepy and dull! She was as lively a child when they took her away as I
      ever saw. What! is there no more about her? The letter is crammed with
      somebody&rsquo;s fete&mdash;vote of want of confidence&mdash;debate last night.
      What is she about? She fancies she knows everything, and, the fact is, she
      knows no more about infants&mdash;I could see that, when the poor little
      thing was a day old!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think there is cause for fear?&rdquo; said Margaret anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell. With a first child, one can&rsquo;t guess what may be mamma&rsquo;s
      fancy, or what may be serious. But Flora is not too fanciful, and I must
      see her for my own satisfaction. Let some one write, and say I will come
      up to-morrow by the twelve o&rsquo;clock train&mdash;and mind she opens the
      letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. May kept his word, and the letter had evidently not been neglected;
      for George was watching for him at the station, and thanked him so eagerly
      for coming, that Dr. May feared that he was indeed needed, and inquired
      anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flora is uneasy about her&mdash;she seems heavy, and cries when she is
      disturbed,&rdquo; replied George. &ldquo;Flora has not left her to-day, and hardly
      yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you had no advice for her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flora preferred waiting till you should come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. May made an impatient movement, and thought the way long, till they
      were set down in Park Lane. Meta came to meet them on the stairs, and said
      that the baby was just the same, and Flora was in the nursery, and thither
      they hastily ascended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, papa! I am so glad you are come!&rdquo; said Flora, starting up from her
      low seat, beside the cradle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. May hardly paused to embrace his daughter, and she anxiously led him
      to the cradle, and tried to read his expression, as his eyes fell on the
      little face, somewhat puffed, but of a waxy whiteness, and the breathing
      seeming to come from the lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long has she been so?&rdquo; he asked, in a rapid, professional manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For about two or three hours. She was very fretful before, but I did not
      like to call in any one, as you were coming. Is it from her teeth?&rdquo; said
      Flora, more and more alarmed by his manner. &ldquo;Her complexion is always like
      that&mdash;she cannot bear to be disturbed,&rdquo; added she, as the child
      feebly moaned, on Dr. May beginning to take her from her cradle; but,
      without attending to the objection, he lifted her up, so that she lay as
      quietly as before, on his arm. Flora had trusted that hope and confidence
      would come with him; but, on the contrary, every lurking misgiving began
      to rush wildly over her, as she watched his countenance, while he carried
      his little granddaughter towards the light, studied her intently, raised
      her drooping eyelids, and looked into her eyes, scarcely eliciting another
      moan. Flora dared not ask a question, but looked on with eyes open, as it
      were, stiffened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the effect of opium,&rdquo; were Dr. May&rsquo;s first words, breaking on all
      with startling suddenness; but, before any one could speak, he added, &ldquo;We
      must try some stimulant directly;&rdquo; then looking round the room, &ldquo;What have
      you nearest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Godfrey&rsquo;s Cordial, sir,&rdquo; quickly suggested the nurse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay&mdash;anything to save time&mdash;she is sinking for want of the drug
      that has&mdash;&rdquo; He broke off to apportion the dose, and to hold the child
      in a position to administer it&mdash;Flora tried to give it&mdash;the
      nurse tried&mdash;in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not torment her further,&rdquo; said the doctor, as Flora would have renewed
      the trial&mdash;&ldquo;it cannot be done. What have you all been doing?&rdquo; cried
      he, as, looking up, his face changed from the tender compassion with which
      he had been regarding his little patient, into a look of strong
      indignation, and one of his sentences of hasty condemnation broke from
      him, as it would not have done, had Flora been less externally calm. &ldquo;I
      tell you this child has been destroyed with opium!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They all recoiled; the father turned fiercely round on the nurse, with a
      violent exclamation, but Dr. May checked him. &ldquo;Hush! This is no presence
      for the wrath of man.&rdquo; The solemn tone seemed to make George shrink into
      an awestruck quiescence; he stood motionless and transfixed, as if indeed
      conscious of some overwhelming presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora had come near, with an imploring gesture, to take the child in her
      own arms; but Dr. May, by a look of authority, prevented it; for, indeed,
      it would have been harassing and distressing the poor little sufferer
      again to move her, as she lay with feeble gasps on his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they remained, for what space no one knew&mdash;not one word was
      uttered, not a limb moved, and the street noises sounded far off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. May stooped his head closer to the babe&rsquo;s face, and seemed listening
      for a breath, as he once more touched the little wrist; he took away his
      finger, he ceased to listen, he looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora gave one cry&mdash;not loud, not sharp, but &ldquo;an exceeding bitter
      cry&rdquo;&mdash;she would have moved forward, but reeled, and her husband&rsquo;s
      arms supported her as she sank into a swoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carry her to her room,&rdquo; said Dr. May. &ldquo;I will come;&rdquo; and, when George had
      borne her away, he kissed the lifeless cheek, and reverently placed the
      little corpse in the cradle; but, as he rose from doing so, the sobbing
      nurse exclaimed, &ldquo;Oh, sir! oh, sir! indeed, I never did&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never did what?&rdquo; said Dr. May sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never gave the dear baby anything to do her harm,&rdquo; cried Preston
      vehemently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You gave her this,&rdquo; said Dr. May, pointing to the bottle of Godfrey&rsquo;s
      Cordial.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could say no more, for her master was hurrying back into the room.
      Anger was the first emotion that possessed him, and he hardly gave an
      answer to Dr. May&rsquo;s question about Flora. &ldquo;Meta is with her! Where is that
      woman? Have you given her up to the police?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Preston shrieked and sobbed, made incoherent exclamations, and was much
      disposed to cling to the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; said Dr. May, lifting his hand, and assuming a tone and manner
      that awed them both, by reminding them that death was present in the
      chamber; and, taking his son-in-law out, and shutting the door, he said,
      in a low voice,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe this is no case for the police&mdash;have mercy on the poor
      woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy&mdash;I&rsquo;ll have no mercy on my child&rsquo;s murderer! You said she had
      destroyed my child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ignorantly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care for ignorance! She destroyed her&mdash;I&rsquo;ll have justice,&rdquo;
       said George doggedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall,&rdquo; said Dr. May, laying his hand on his arm; &ldquo;but it must be
      investigated, and you are in no state to investigate. Go downstairs&mdash;do
      not do anything till I come to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His peremptory manner imposed on George, who, nevertheless, turned round
      as he went, saying, with a fierce glare in his eyes, &ldquo;You will not let her
      escape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Go down&mdash;be quiet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. May returned to Preston, and had to assure her that Mr. Rivers was not
      gone to call the police, before he could bring her to any degree of
      coherence. She regarded him as her only friend, and soon undertook to tell
      the whole truth, and he perceived that it was, indeed, the truth. She had
      not known that the cordial was injurious, deeming it a panacea against
      fretfulness, precious to nurses, but against which ladies always had a
      prejudice, and, therefore, to be kept secret. Poor little Leonora had been
      very fretful and uneasy when Flora&rsquo;s many avocations had first caused her
      to be set aside, and Preston had had recourse to the remedy which, lulling
      her successfully, was applied with less moderation and judgment than would
      have been shown by a more experienced person, till gradually the poor
      child became dependent on it for every hour of rest. When her mother, at
      last, became aware of her unsatisfactory condition, and spent her time in
      watching her, the nurse being prevented from continuing her drug, she was,
      of course, so miserable without it, that Preston had ventured on proposing
      it, to which Mrs. Rivers had replied with displeasure sufficient to
      prevent her from declaring how much she had previously given. Preston was
      in an agony of distress for her little charge, as well as of fear for
      herself, and could hardly understand what her error had been. Dr. May soon
      saw that, though not highly principled, her sorrow was sincere, and that
      she still wept bitterly over the consequences of her treatment, when he
      told her that she had nothing to fear from the law, and that he would
      protect her from Mr. Rivers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her confession was hardly over when Meta knocked at the door, pale and
      frightened. &ldquo;Oh, Dr. May, do come to poor Flora! I don&rsquo;t know what to do,
      and George is in such a state!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. May made a sound of sorrow and perplexity, and Meta, as she went down
      before him, asked, in a low, horror-stricken whisper, &ldquo;Did Preston really&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not knowingly,&rdquo; said Dr. May. &ldquo;It is the way many children have gone; but
      I never thought&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had come to Flora&rsquo;s dressing-room. Her bedroom door was open, and
      George was pacing heavily up and down the length of both apartments,
      fiercely indignant. &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said he, advancing eagerly on Dr. May, &ldquo;has
      she confessed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Flora!&rdquo; said Dr. May, instead of answering him. Flora lay on her bed,
      her face hidden on her pillow, only now and then moaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flora, my poor, poor child!&rdquo; said her father, bending down to raise her,
      and taking her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      She moved away, so as to bury her face more completely; but there was life
      in the movement, and he was sufficiently reassured on her situation to be
      able to attend to George, who was only impatient to rush off to take his
      revenge. He led him into the outer room, where Meta was waiting, and
      forced upon his unwilling conviction that it was no case for the law. The
      child had not been killed by any one dose, but had rather sunk from the
      want of stimulus, to which she had been accustomed. As to any pity for the
      woman, George would not hear of it. She was still, in his eyes, the
      destroyer of his child; and, when he found the law would afford him no
      vengeance, he insisted that she should be turned out of his house at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George!&rdquo; called a hollow voice from the next room, and hurrying back,
      they saw Flora sitting up, and, as well as trembling limbs allowed,
      endeavouring to rise to her feet, while burning spots were in her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George, turn me out of the house too! If Preston killed her, I did!&rdquo; and
      she gave a ghastly laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      George threw his arms round her, and laid her on her bed again, with many
      fond words, and strength which she had not power to withstand. Dr. May, in
      the meantime, spoke quickly to Meta in the doorway. &ldquo;She must go. They
      cannot see her again; but has she any friends in London?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Find out. She must not be sent adrift. Send her to the Grange, if nothing
      better offers. You must judge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He felt that he could confide in Meta&rsquo;s discretion and promptitude, and
      returned to the parents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she gone?&rdquo; said George, in a whisper, which he meant should be unheard
      by his wife, who had sunk her face in her pillows again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going. Meta is seeing to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that woman gets off free!&rdquo; cried George, &ldquo;while my poor little girl&mdash;&rdquo;
       and, no longer occupied by the hope of retribution, he gave way to an
      overpowering burst of grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife did not rouse herself to comfort him, but still lay motionless,
      excepting for a convulsive movement that passed over her frame at each
      sound from him, and her father felt her pulse bound at the same time with
      corresponding violence, as if each of his deep-drawn sobs were a mortal
      thrust. Going to him, Dr. May endeavoured to repress his agitation, and
      lead him from the room; but he could not, at first, prevail on him to
      listen or understand, still less, to quit Flora. The attempt to force on
      him the perception that his uncontrolled sorrow was injuring her, and that
      he ought to bear up for her sake, only did further harm; for, when he rose
      up and tried to caress her, there was the same torpid, passive resistance,
      the same burying her face from the light, and the only betrayal of
      consciousness in the agonised throbs of her pulse.
    </p>
    <p>
      He became excessively distressed at being thus repelled, and, at last,
      yielded to the impatient signals of Dr. May, who drew him into the next
      room, and, with brief, strong, though most affectionate and pitying words,
      enforced on him that Flora&rsquo;s brain&mdash;nay, her life, was risked, and
      that he must leave her alone to his care for the present. Meta coming back
      at the same moment, Dr. May put him in her charge, with renewed orders to
      impress on him how much depended on tranquillity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. May went back, with his soft, undisturbing, physician&rsquo;s footfall, and
      stood at the side of the bed, in such intense anxiety as those only can
      endure who know how to pray, and to pray in resignation and faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      All was still in the darkening twilight; but the distant roar of the world
      surged without, and a gaslight shone flickering through the branches of
      the trees, and fell on the rich dress spread on the couch, and the
      ornaments on the toilet-table. There was a sense of oppression, and of
      being pursued by the incongruous world, and Dr. May sighed to silence all
      around, and see his poor daughter in the calm of her own country air; but
      she had chosen for herself, and here she lay, stricken down in the midst
      of the prosperity that she had sought.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could hear every respiration, tightened and almost sobbing, and he was
      hesitating whether to run the risk of addressing her; when, as if it had
      occurred to her suddenly that she was alone and deserted, she raised up
      her head with a startled movement, but, as she saw him, she again hid her
      face, as if his presence were still more intolerable than solitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flora! my own, my dearest&mdash;my poor child! you should not turn from
      me. Do I not carry with me the like self-reproachful conviction?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flora let him turn her face towards him and kiss her forehead. It was
      burning, and he brought water and bathed it, now and then speaking a few
      fond, low, gentle words, which, though she did not respond, evidently had
      some soothing effect; for she admitted his services, still, however,
      keeping her eyes closed, and her face turned towards the darkest side of
      the room. When he went towards the door, she murmured, &ldquo;Papa!&rdquo; as if to
      detain him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not going, darling. I only wanted to speak to George.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let him come!&rdquo; said Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not till you wish it, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      George&rsquo;s step was heard; his hand was on the lock, and again Dr. May was
      conscious of the sudden rush of blood through all her veins. He quickly
      went forward, met him, and shut him out, persuading him, with difficulty,
      to remain outside, and giving him the occupation of sending out for an
      anodyne&mdash;since the best hope, at present, lay in encouraging the
      torpor that had benumbed her crushed faculties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father would not even venture to rouse her to be undressed; he gave
      her the medicine, and let her lie still, with as little movement as
      possible, standing by till her regular breathings showed that she had sunk
      into a sleep; when he went into the other room and found that George had
      also forgotten his sorrows in slumber on the sofa, while Meta sat sadly
      presiding over the tea equipage.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came up to meet him, her question expressed in her looks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Asleep,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I hope the pulses are quieter. All depends on her
      wakening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor, poor Flora!&rdquo; said Meta, wiping away her tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you done with the woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sent her to Mrs. Larpent&rsquo;s. I knew she would receive her and keep her
      till she could write to her friends. Bellairs took her, but I could hardly
      speak to her&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She did it ignorantly,&rdquo; said Dr. May.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could never be so merciful and forbearing as you,&rdquo; said Meta.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! my dear, you will never have the same cause!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They could say no more, for George awoke, and the argument of his
      exclusion had to be gone through again. He could not enter into it by any
      means; and when Dr. May would have made him understand that poor Flora
      could not acquit herself of neglect, and that even his affection was too
      painful for her in the present state; he broke into a vehement angry
      defence of her devotion to her child, treating Dr. May as if the
      accusation came from him; and when the doctor and Meta had persuaded him
      out of this, he next imagined that his father-in-law feared that he was
      going to reproach his wife, and there was no making him comprehend more
      than that, if she were not kept quiet, she might have a serious illness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even then he insisted on going to look at her, and Dr. May could not
      prevent him from pressing his lips to her forehead. She half opened her
      eyes, and murmured &ldquo;good-night,&rdquo; and by this he was a little comforted;
      but he would hear of nothing but sitting up, and Meta would have done the
      same, but for an absolute decree of the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a relief to Dr. May that George&rsquo;s vigil soon became a sound repose
      on the sofa in the dressing-room; and he was left to read and muse
      uninterruptedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was far past two o&rsquo;clock before there was any movement; then Flora drew
      a long breath, stirred, and, as her father came and drew her hand into
      his, before she was well awake, she gave a long, wondering whisper, &ldquo;Oh,
      papa! papa!&rdquo; then sitting up, and passing her hand over her eyes, &ldquo;Is it
      all true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true, my own poor dear,&rdquo; said Dr. May, supporting her, as she
      rested against his arm, and hid her face on his shoulder, while her breath
      came short, and she shivered under the renewed perception&mdash;&ldquo;she is
      gone to wait for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! Oh, don&rsquo;t! papa!&rdquo; said Flora, her voice shortened by anguish. &ldquo;Oh,
      think why&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, Flora, do not, do not speak as if that should exclude peace or
      hope!&rdquo; said Dr. May entreatingly. &ldquo;Besides, it was no wilful neglect&mdash;you
      had other duties&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know me, papa,&rdquo; said Flora, drawing her hands away from him,
      and tightly clenching them in one another, as thoughts far too terrible
      for words swept over her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I do not, the most Merciful Father does,&rdquo; said Dr. May. Flora sat for
      a minute or two, her hands locked together round her knees, her head bowed
      down, her lips compressed. Her father was so far satisfied that the bodily
      dangers he had dreaded were averted; but the agony of mind was far more
      terrible, especially in one who expressed so little, and in whom it
      seemed, as it were, pent up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa!&rdquo; said Flora presently, with a resolution of tone as if she would
      prevent resistance; &ldquo;I must see her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall, my dear,&rdquo; said the doctor at once; and she seemed grateful not
      to be opposed, speaking more gently, as she said, &ldquo;May it be now&mdash;while
      there is no daylight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you wish it,&rdquo; said Dr. May.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dawn, and a yellow waning moon, gave sufficient light for moving
      about, and Flora gained her feet; but she was weak and trembling, and
      needed the support of her father&rsquo;s arm, though hardly conscious of
      receiving it, as she mounted the same stairs, that she had so often
      lightly ascended in the like doubtful morning light; for never, after any
      party, had she omitted her visit to the nursery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door was locked, and she looked piteously at her father as her weak
      push met the resistance, and he was somewhat slow in turning the key with
      his left hand. The whitewashed, slightly furnished room reflected the
      light, and the moonbeams showed the window-frame in pale and dim shades on
      the blinds, the dewy air breathed in coolly from the park, and there was a
      calm solemnity in the atmosphere&mdash;no light, no watcher present to
      tend the babe. Little Leonora needed such no more; she was with the
      Keeper, who shall neither slumber nor sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it thrilled across her grandfather, as he saw the little cradle drawn
      into the middle of the room, and, on the coverlet, some pure white
      rosebuds and lilies of the valley, gathered in the morning by Mary and
      Blanche, little guessing the use that Meta would make of them ere
      nightfall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mother sank on her knees, her hands clasped over her breast, and
      rocking herself to and fro uneasily, with a low, irrepressible moaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you not see her face?&rdquo; whispered Dr. May.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may not touch her,&rdquo; was the answer, in the hollow voice, and with the
      wild eye that had before alarmed him; but trusting to the soothing power
      of the mute face of the innocent, he drew back the covering.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sight was such as he anticipated, sadly lovely, smiling and tranquil&mdash;all
      oppression and suffering fled away for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      It stilled the sounds of pain, and the restless motion; the compression of
      the hands became less tight, and he began to hope that the look was
      passing into her heart. He let her kneel on without interruption, only
      once he said, &ldquo;Of such is the kingdom of Heaven!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made no immediate answer, and he had had time to doubt whether he
      ought to let her continue in that exhausting attitude any longer, when she
      looked up and said, &ldquo;You will all be with her there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has flown on to point your aim more steadfastly,&rdquo; said Dr. May.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora shuddered, but spoke calmly&mdash;&ldquo;No, I shall not meet her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My child!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;do you know what you are saying?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, I am not in the way,&rdquo; said Flora, still in the same fearfully
      quiet, matter-of-fact tone. &ldquo;I never have been&rdquo;&mdash;and she bent over
      her child, as if taking her leave for eternity.
    </p>
    <p>
      His tongue almost clave to the roof of his mouth, as he heard the words&mdash;words
      elicited by one of those hours of true reality that, like death, rend
      aside every wilful cloak of self-deceit, and self-approbation. He had no
      power to speak at first; when he recovered it, his reply was not what his
      heart had, at first, prompted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flora! How has this dear child been saved?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What has released
      her from the guilt she inherited through you, through me, through all? Is
      not the Fountain open?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She never wasted grace,&rdquo; said Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My child! my Flora!&rdquo; he exclaimed, losing the calmness he had gained by
      such an effort; &ldquo;you must not talk thus&mdash;it is wrong! Only your own
      morbid feeling can treat this&mdash;this&mdash;as a charge against you,
      and if it were, indeed&rdquo;&mdash;he sank his voice&mdash;&ldquo;that such
      consequences destroyed hope, oh, Flora! where should I be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Flora, &ldquo;this is not what I meant. It is that I have never set
      my heart right. I am not like you nor my sisters. I have seemed to myself,
      and to you, to be trying to do right, but it was all hollow, for the sake
      of praise and credit. I know it, now it is too late; and He has let me
      destroy my child here, lest I should have destroyed her everlasting life,
      like my own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The most terrible part of this sentence was to Dr. May, that Flora spoke
      as if she knew it all as a certainty, and without apparent emotion, with
      all the calmness of despair. What she had never guessed before had come
      clearly and fully upon her now, and without apparent novelty, or, perhaps,
      there had been misgivings in the midst of her complacent
      self-satisfaction. She did not even seem to perceive how dreadfully she
      was shocking her father, whose sole comfort was in believing her language
      the effect of exaggerated self-reproach. His profession had rendered him
      not new to the sight of despondency, and, dismayed as he was, he was able
      at once to speak to the point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it were indeed so, her removal would be the greatest blessing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said her mother, and her assent was in the same tone of resigned
      despair, owning it best for her child to be spared a worldly education,
      and loving her truly enough to acquiesce.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I meant the greatest blessing to you,&rdquo; continued Dr. May, &ldquo;if it be sent
      to open your eyes, and raise your thoughts upwards. Oh, Flora, are not
      afflictions tokens of infinite love?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She could not accept the encouragement, and only formed, with her lips,
      the words, &ldquo;Mercy to her&mdash;wrath to me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The simplicity and hearty piety which, with all Dr. May&rsquo;s faults, had
      always been part of his character, and had borne him, in faith and trust,
      through all his trials, had never belonged to her. Where he had been
      sincere, erring only from impulsiveness, she had been double-minded and
      calculating; and, now that her delusion had been broken down, she had
      nothing to rest upon. Her whole religious life had been mechanical,
      deceiving herself more than even others, and all seemed now swept away,
      except the sense of hypocrisy, and of having cut herself off, for ever,
      from her innocent child. Her father saw that it was vain to argue with
      her, and only said, &ldquo;You will think otherwise by and by, my dear. Now
      shall I say a prayer before we go down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she made no reply, he repeated the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, but she did not join;
      and then he added a broken, hesitating intercession for the mourners,
      which caused her to bury her face deeper in her hands, but her dull
      wretchedness altered not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rising, he said authoritatively, &ldquo;Come, Flora, you must go to bed. See, it
      is morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have sat up all night with me!&rdquo; said Flora, with somewhat of her
      anxious, considerate self.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So has George. He had just dropped asleep on the sofa when you awoke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought he was in anger,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not with you, dearest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I remember now, not where it was justly due. Papa,&rdquo; she said,
      pausing, as to recall her recollection, &ldquo;what did I do? I must have done
      something very unkind to make him go away and leave me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I insisted on his leaving you, my dear. You seemed oppressed, and his
      affectionate ways were doing you harm; so I was hardhearted, and turned
      him out, sadly against his will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor George!&rdquo; said Flora, &ldquo;has he been left to bear it alone all this
      time? How much distressed he must have been. I must have vexed him
      grievously. You don&rsquo;t guess how fond he was of her. I must go to him at
      once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is right, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t praise me,&rdquo; said she, as if she could not bear it. &ldquo;All that is
      left for me is to do what I can for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. May felt cheered. He was sure that hope must again rise out of
      unselfish love and duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their return awoke George, who started, half sitting up, wondering why he
      was spending the night in so unusual a manner, and why Flora looked so
      pale, in the morning light, with her loosened, drooping hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went straight to him, and, kneeling by his side, said, &ldquo;George,
      forgive!&rdquo; The same moment he had caught her to his bosom; but so impressed
      was his tardy mind with the peril of talking to her, that he held her in
      his arms without a single word, till Dr. May had unclosed his lips&mdash;a
      sign would not suffice&mdash;he must have a sentence to assure him; and
      then it was such joy to have her restored, and his fondness and solicitude
      were so tender and eager in their clumsiness, that his father-in-law was
      touched to the heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora was quite herself again, in presence of mind and power of dealing
      with him; and Dr. May left them to each other, and went to his own room,
      for such rest as sorrow, sympathy, and the wakening city, would permit
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the house was astir in the morning, and the doctor had met Meta in
      the breakfast-room, and held with her a sad, affectionate conversation,
      George came down with a fair report of his wife, and took her father to
      see her.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night had been like an illness to her, and, though perfectly
      composed, she was feeble and crushed, keeping the room darkened, and
      reluctant to move or speak. Indeed, she did not seem able to give her
      attention to any one&rsquo;s voice, except her husband&rsquo;s. When Dr. May, or Meta,
      spoke to her, she would miss what they said, beg their pardon, and ask
      them to repeat it; and sometimes, even then, become bewildered. They tried
      reading to her, but she did not seem to listen, and her half-closed eye
      had the expression of listless dejection, that her father knew betokened
      that, even as last night, her heart refused to accept promises of comfort
      as meant for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      For George, however, her attention was always ready, and was perpetually
      claimed. He was forlorn and at a loss without her, every moment; and, in
      the sorrow which he too felt most acutely, could not have a minute&rsquo;s peace
      unless soothed by her presence; he was dependent on her to a degree which
      amazed and almost provoked the doctor, who could not bear to have her
      continually harassed and disturbed, and yet was much affected by
      witnessing so much tenderness, especially in Flora, always the cold
      utilitarian member of his family.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the middle of the day she rose and dressed, because George was unhappy
      at having to sit without her, though only in the next room. She sat in the
      large arm-chair, turned away from the blinded windows, never speaking nor
      moving, save when he came to her, to make her look at his letters and
      notes, when she would, with the greatest patience and sweetness, revise
      them, suggest word or sentence, rouse herself to consider each petty
      detail, and then sink back into her attitude of listless dejection. To all
      besides, she appeared totally indifferent; gently courteous to Meta and to
      her father, when they addressed her, but otherwise showing little
      consciousness whether they were in the room; and yet, when something was
      passing about her father&rsquo;s staying or returning, she rose from her seat,
      came up to him before he was aware, and said, &ldquo;Papa! papa! you will not
      leave me!&rdquo; in such an imploring tone, that if he had ever thought of
      quitting her, he could not have done so.
    </p>
    <p>
      He longed to see her left to perfect tranquillity, but such could not be
      in London. Though theirs was called a quiet house, the rushing stream of
      traffic wearied his country ears, the door bell seemed ceaselessly
      ringing, and though Meta bore the brunt of the notes and messages, great
      numbers necessarily came up to Mr. Rivers, and of these Flora was not
      spared one. Dr. May had his share too of messages and business, and
      friends and relations, the Rivers&rsquo; kindred, always ready to take offence
      with their rich connections, and who would not be satisfied with
      inquiries, at the door, but must see Meta, and would have George fetched
      down to them&mdash;old aunts, who wanted the whole story of the child&rsquo;s
      illness, and came imagining there was something to be hushed up; Lady
      Leonora extremely polite, but extremely disgusted at the encounter with
      them; George ready to be persuaded to take every one up to see his wife,
      and the prohibition to be made by Dr. May over and over again&mdash;it was
      a most tedious, wearing afternoon, and at last, when the visitors had
      gone, and George had hurried back to his wife, Dr. May threw himself into
      an arm-chair and said, &ldquo;Oh, Meta, sorrow weighs more heavily in town than
      in the country!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; said Meta. &ldquo;If one only could go out and look at the flowers, and
      take poor Flora up a nosegay!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it would make much difference to her,&rdquo; sighed the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think it would,&rdquo; said Meta; &ldquo;it did to me. The sights there speak
      of the better sights.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The power to look must come from within,&rdquo; said Dr. May, thinking of his
      poor daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said Meta, &ldquo;as Mr. Ernescliffe said, &lsquo;heaven is as near&mdash;!&rsquo; But
      the skirts of heaven are more easily traced in our mountain view than
      here, where, if I looked out of window, I should only see that giddy
      string of carriages and people pursuing each other!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we shall get her home as soon as she is able to move, and I hope it
      may soothe her. What a turmoil it is! There has not been one moment
      without noise in the twenty-two hours I have been here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you say if you were in the city?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! there&rsquo;s no talking of it; but if I had been a fashionable London
      physician, as my father-in-law wanted to make me, I should have been dead
      long ago!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I think you would have liked it very much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love&rsquo;s a flower that will not die,&rdquo; repeated Meta, half smiling. &ldquo;You
      would have found so much good to do&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so much misery to rend one&rsquo;s heart,&rdquo; said Dr. May. &ldquo;But, after all, I
      suppose there is only a certain capacity of feeling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is within, not without, as you said,&rdquo; returned Meta.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, there&rsquo;s another!&rdquo; cried Dr. May, almost petulant at the sound of the
      bell again, breaking into the conversation that was a great refreshment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was Sir Henry Walkinghame&rsquo;s ring,&rdquo; said Meta. &ldquo;It is always his time
      of day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor did not like it the better.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Henry sent up a message to ask whether he could see Mr. or Miss
      Rivers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose we must,&rdquo; said Meta, looking at the doctor. &ldquo;Lady Walkinghame
      must be anxious about Flora.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She blushed greatly, fancying that Dr. May was putting his own
      construction on the heightened colour which she could not control. Sir
      Henry came in, just what he ought to be, kindly anxious, but not
      overwhelming, and with a ready, pleased recognition of the doctor, as an
      old acquaintance of his boyhood. He did not stay many minutes; but there
      was a perceptible difference between his real sympathy and friendly regard
      only afraid of obtruding, and the oppressive curiosity of their former
      visitors. Dr. May felt it due, both from kindness and candour, to say
      something in his praise when he was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a sensible superior man,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He will be an acquisition
      when he takes up his abode at Drydale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Meta; a very simple yes, from which nothing could be gathered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The funeral was fixed for Monday, the next day but one, at the church
      where Mr. Rivers had been buried. No one was invited to be present; Ethel
      wrote that, much as she wished it, she could not leave Margaret, and, as
      the whole party were to return home on the following day, they should soon
      see Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora had laid aside all privileges of illness after the first day; she
      came downstairs to breakfast and dinner, and though looking wretchedly
      ill, and speaking very low and feebly, she was as much as ever the
      mistress of her house. Her father could never draw her into conversation
      again on the subject nearest his heart, and could only draw the sad
      conclusion that her state of mind was unchanged, from the dreary
      indifference with which she allowed every word of cheer to pass by
      unheeded, as if she could not bear to look beyond the grave. He had some
      hope in the funeral, which she was bent on attending, and more in the
      influence of Margaret, and the counsel of Richard, or of Mr. Wllmot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The burial, however, failed to bring any peaceful comfort to the mourning
      mother. Meta&rsquo;s tears flowed freely, as much for her father as for her
      little niece; and George&rsquo;s sobs were deep and choking; but Flora,
      externally, only seemed absorbed in helping him to go through with it;
      she, herself, never lost her fixed, composed, hopeless look.
    </p>
    <p>
      After her return, she went up to the nursery, and deliberately set apart
      and locked up every possession of her child&rsquo;s, then, coming down, startled
      Meta by laying her hand on her shoulder and saying, &ldquo;Meta, dear, Preston
      is in the housekeeper&rsquo;s room. Will you go and speak to her for a moment,
      to reassure her before I come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Flora!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sent for her,&rdquo; said Flora, in answer. &ldquo;I thought it would be a good
      opportunity while George is out. Will you be kind enough to prepare her,
      my dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meta wondered how Flora had known whither to send, but she could not but
      obey. Poor Preston was an ordinary sort of woman, kind-hearted, and not
      without a conscience; but her error had arisen from the want of any high
      religious principle to teach her obedience, or sincerity. Her grief was
      extreme, and she had been so completely overcome by the forbearance and
      consideration shown to her, that she was even more broken-hearted by the
      thought of them, than by the terrible calamity she had occasioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kind-hearted Mrs. Larpent had tried to console her, as well as to turn the
      misfortune to the best account, and Dr. May had once seen her, and striven
      gently to point out the true evil of the course she had pursued. She was
      now going to her home, and they augured better of her, that she had been
      as yet too utterly downcast to say one word of that first thought with a
      servant, her character.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meta found her sobbing uncontrollably at the associations of her master&rsquo;s
      house, and dreadfully frightened at hearing that she was to see Mrs.
      Rivers; she began to entreat to the contrary with the vehemence of a
      person unused to any self-government; but, in the midst, the low calm
      tones were heard, and her mistress stood before her&mdash;her perfect
      stillness of demeanour far more effective in repressing agitation, than
      had been Meta&rsquo;s coaxing attempts to soothe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need not be afraid to see me, Preston,&rdquo; said Flora kindly. &ldquo;I am very
      sorry for you&mdash;you knew no better, and I should not have left so much
      to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;so kind&mdash;the dear, dear little darling&mdash;I shall
      never forgive myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you did love her,&rdquo; continued Flora. &ldquo;I am sure you intended no
      harm, and it was my leaving her that made her fretful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Preston tried to thank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only remember henceforth&rdquo;&mdash;and the clear tone grew fainter than ever
      with internal anguish, though still steady&mdash;&ldquo;remember strict
      obedience and truth henceforth; the want of them will have worse results
      by and by than even this. Now, Preston, I shall always wish you well. I
      ought not, I believe, to recommend you to the like place, without saying
      why you left me, but for any other I will give you a fair character. I
      will see what I can do for you, and if you are ever in any distress, I
      hope you will let me know. Have your wages been paid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a sound in the affirmative, but poor Preston could not speak.
      &ldquo;Good-bye, then,&rdquo; and Flora took her hand and shook it. &ldquo;Mind you let me
      hear if you want help. Keep this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meta was a little disappointed to see sovereigns instead of a book. Flora
      turned to go, and put her hand out to lean on her sister as for support;
      she stood still to gather strength before ascending the stairs, and a
      groan of intense misery was wrung from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest Flora, it has been too much!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Flora gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor thing, I am glad for her sake. But might she not have a book&mdash;a
      Bible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may give her one, if you like. I could not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flora reached her own room, went in, and bolted the door.

      CHAPTER XXI.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Oh, where dwell ye, my ain sweet bairns?
       I&rsquo;m woe and weary grown!
     Oh, Lady, we live where woe never is,
       In a land to flesh unknown.&mdash;ALLAN CUNNINGHAM.
</pre>
    <p>
      It had been with a gentle sorrow that Etheldred had expected to go and lay
      in her resting-place, the little niece, who had been kept from the evil of
      the world, in a manner of which she had little dreamt. Poor Flora! she
      must be ennobled, she thought, by having a child where hers is, when she
      is able to feel anything but the first grief; and Ethel&rsquo;s heart yearned to
      be trying, at least, to comfort her, and to be with her father, who had
      loved his grandchild so fondly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not to be. Margaret had borne so many shocks with such calmness,
      that Ethel had no especial fears for her; but there are some persons who
      have less fortitude for others than for themselves, and she was one of
      these. Ethel had been her own companion-sister, and the baby had been the
      sunbeam of her life, during the sad winter and spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the middle of the night, Ethel knocked at Richard&rsquo;s door. Margaret had
      been seized with faintness, from which they could not bring her back; and,
      even when Richard had summoned Dr. Spencer, it was long ere his remedies
      took effect; but, at last, she revived enough to thank them, and say she
      was glad that papa was not there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Spencer sent them all to bed, and the rest of the night was quiet; but
      Margaret could not deny, in the morning, that she felt terribly shattered,
      and she was depressed in spirits to a degree such as they had never seen
      in her before. Her whole heart was with Flora; she was unhappy at being at
      a distance from her, almost fretfully impatient for letters, and insisting
      vehemently on Ethel&rsquo;s going to London.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel had never felt so helpless and desolate, as with Margaret thus
      changed and broken, and her father absent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said Dr. Spencer, &ldquo;nothing can be better for both parties than
      that he should be away. If he were here, he ought to leave all attendance
      to me, and she would suffer from the sight of his distress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot think what he will do or feel!&rdquo; sighed Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave it to me. I will write to him, and we shall see her better before
      post time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will tell him exactly how it was, or I shall,&rdquo; said Ethel abruptly,
      not to say fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho! you don&rsquo;t trust me?&rdquo; said Dr. Spencer, smiling, so that she was
      ashamed of her speech. &ldquo;You shall speak for yourself, and I for myself;
      and I shall say that nothing would so much hurt her as to have others
      sacrificed to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said Ethel; &ldquo;but she misses papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course she does; but, depend on it, she would not have him leave your
      sister, and she is under less restraint without him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never saw her like this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The drop has made it overflow. She has repressed more than was good for
      her, and now that her guard is broken down, she gives way under the whole
      weight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Margaret! I am pertinacious; but, if she is not better by post time,
      papa will not bear to be away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I think of her by that time. Send up your brother
      Richard, if you wish to do her good. Richard would be a much better person
      to write than yourself. I perceive that he is the reasonable member of the
      family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did not you know that before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All I knew of him, till last night, was, that no one could, by any
      possibility, call him Dick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Spencer was glad to have dismissed Ethel smiling; and she was the
      better able to bear with poor Margaret&rsquo;s condition of petulance. She had
      never before experienced the effects of bodily ailments on the temper, and
      she was slow to understand the change in one usually so patient and
      submissive. She was, by turns, displeased with her sister and with her own
      abruptness; but, though she knew it not, her bluntness had a bracing
      effect. She thought she had been cross in declaring it was nonsense to
      harp on her going to London; but it made Margaret feel that she had been
      unreasonable, and keep silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard managed her much better, being gentle and firm, and less ready to
      speak than Ethel, and he succeeded in composing her into a sleep, which
      restored her balance, and so relieved Ethel, that she not only allowed Dr.
      Spencer to say what he pleased, but herself made light of the whole
      attack, little knowing how perilous was any shock to that delicate frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret&rsquo;s whole purpose was to wind herself up for the first interview
      with Flora; and though she had returned to her usual state, she would not
      go downstairs on the evening the party were expected, believing it would
      be more grateful to her sister&rsquo;s feelings to meet her without witnesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The travellers arrived, and Dr. May hurried up to her. She barely replied
      to his caresses and inquiries in her eagerness to hear of Flora, and to
      convince him that he must not forbid the meeting. Nor had he any mind so
      to do. &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; said he, when he had seen the spiritualised look of her
      glistening blue eyes, the flush on her transparent cheeks, and her hands
      clasped over her breast&mdash;&ldquo;surely poor Flora must feel as though an
      angel were waiting to comfort her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flora came, but there was sore disappointment. Fond and tender she was as
      ever, but, neither by word or gesture, would she admit the most remote
      allusion to her grief. She withdrew her hand when Margaret&rsquo;s pressure
      became expressive; she avoided her eye, and spoke incessantly of different
      subjects. All the time, her voice was low and hollow, her face had a
      settled expression of wretchedness, and her glances wandered drearily and
      restlessly anywhere but to Margaret&rsquo;s face; but her steadiness of manner
      was beyond her sister&rsquo;s power to break, and her visit was shortened on
      account of her husband. Poor George had quite given way at the sight of
      Gertrude, whom his little girl had been thought to resemble; and, though
      Dr. May had soothed him almost like a child, no one put any trust in his
      self-control, and all sat round, fearing each word or look, till Flora
      came downstairs, and they departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard and Ethel each offered to go with them; they could not bear to
      think of their spending that first evening in their childless home; but
      Flora gently, but decidedly, refused; and Dr. May said that, much as he
      wished to be with them, he believed that Flora preferred having no one but
      Meta. &ldquo;I hope I have done Margaret no harm,&rdquo; were Flora&rsquo;s last words to
      him, and they seemed to explain her guarded manner; but he found Margaret
      weeping as she had never wept for herself, and palpitation and faintness
      were the consequence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel looked on at Flora as a sad and perplexing mystery during the weeks
      that ensued. There were few opportunities of being alone together, and
      Flora shrank from such as they were&mdash;nay, she checked all expression
      of solicitude, and made her very kisses rapid and formal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sorrow that had fallen on the Grange seemed to have changed none of
      the usual habits there&mdash;visiting, riding, driving, dinners, and
      music, went on with little check. Flora was sure to be found the animated,
      attentive lady of the house, or else sharing her husband&rsquo;s pursuits,
      helping him with his business, or assisting him in seeking pleasure,
      spending whole afternoons at the coachmaker&rsquo;s over a carriage that they
      were building, and, it was reported, playing ecarte in the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had grief come to be forgotten and cast aside without effecting any
      mission? Yet Ethel could not believe that the presence of the awful
      messenger was unfelt, when she heard poor George&rsquo;s heavy sigh, or when she
      looked at Flora&rsquo;s countenance, and heard the peculiar low, subdued tone of
      her voice, which, when her words were most cheerful, always seemed to
      Ethel the resigned accent of despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel could not talk her over with Margaret, for all seemed to make it a
      point that Margaret should believe the best. Dr. May turned from the
      subject with a sort of shuddering grief, and said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk of her,
      poor child&mdash;only pray for her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel, though shocked by the unwonted manner of his answer, was somewhat
      consoled by perceiving that a double measure of tenderness had sprung up
      between her father and his poor daughter. If Flora had seemed, in her
      girlhood, to rate him almost cheaply, this was at an end now; she met him
      as if his embrace were peace, the gloom was lightened, the attention less
      strained, when he was beside her, and she could not part with him without
      pressing for a speedy meeting. Yet she treated him with the same reserve;
      since that one ghastly revelation of the secrets of her heart, the veil
      had been closely drawn, and he could not guess whether it had been but a
      horrible thought, or were still an abiding impression. Ethel could gather
      no more than that her father was very unhappy about Flora, and that
      Richard understood why; for Richard had told her that he had written to
      Flora, to try to persuade her to cease from this reserve, but that he had
      no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norman was not at home; he had undertaken the tutorship of two schoolboys
      for the holidays; and his father owned, with a sigh, that he was doing
      wisely.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to Meta, she was Ethel&rsquo;s chief consolation, by the redoubled
      assurances, directed to Ethel&rsquo;s unexpressed dread, lest Flora should be
      rejecting the chastening Hand. Meta had the most absolute certainty that
      Flora&rsquo;s apparent cheerfulness was all for George&rsquo;s sake, and that it was a
      most painful exertion. &ldquo;If Ethel could only see how she let herself sink
      together, as it were, and her whole countenance relax, as soon as he was
      out of sight,&rdquo; Meta said, &ldquo;she could not doubt what misery these efforts
      were to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why does she go on with them?&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George,&rdquo; said Meta. &ldquo;What would become of him without her? If he misses
      her for ten minutes he roams about lost, and he cannot enjoy anything
      without her. I cannot think how he can help seeing what hard work it is,
      and how he can be contented with those dreadful sham smiles; but as long
      as she can give him pleasure, poor Flora will toil for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very selfish,&rdquo; Ethel caught herself saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, it is not,&rdquo; cried Meta. &ldquo;It is not that he will not see, but that
      he cannot see. Good honest fellow, he really thinks it does her good and
      pleases her. I was so sorry one evening when I tried to take her place at
      that perpetual ecarte, and told him it teased her; he went so wistfully to
      her, and asked whether it did, and she exerted herself into such painful
      enjoyment to persuade him to the contrary; and afterwards she said to me,
      &lsquo;Let me alone, dearest&mdash;it is the only thing left me.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is something in being husband and wife that one cannot understand,&rdquo;
       slowly said Ethel, so much in her quaint way that Meta laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had it not been for Norman&rsquo;s absence, Ethel would, in the warm sympathy
      and accustomed manner of Meta Rivers, have forgotten all about the hopes
      and fears that, in brighter days, had centred on that small personage;
      until one day, as she came home from Cocksmoor, she found &ldquo;Sir Henry
      Walkinghame&rsquo;s&rdquo; card on the drawing-room table. &ldquo;I should like to bite you!
      Coming here, are you?&rdquo; was her amiable reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meta, in her riding-habit, peeped out of Margaret&rsquo;s room. &ldquo;Oh, Ethel,
      there you are! It is such a boon that you did not come home sooner, or we
      should have had to ride home with him! I heard him asking for the Miss
      Mays! And now I am in hopes that he will go home without falling in with
      Flora and George.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not know he was in these parts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He came to Drydale last week, but the place is forlorn, and George gave
      him a general invitation to the Grange.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you like him?&rdquo; said Ethel, while Margaret looked on, amazed at her
      audacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I liked him very much in London,&rdquo; said Meta; &ldquo;he is pleasant enough to
      talk to, but somehow, he is not congruous here&mdash;if you understand me.
      And I think his coming oppresses Flora&mdash;she turned quite pale when he
      was announced, and her voice was lower than ever when she spoke to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he come often?&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he has anything else to do,&rdquo; returned Meta, &ldquo;for our house
      cannot be as pleasant as it was; but he is very kind to George, and for
      that we must be grateful. One thing I am afraid of, that he will persuade
      us off to the yachting after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; was the general exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Meta. &ldquo;George seemed to like the plan, and I very much fear
      that he is taking a dislike to the dear old Grange. I heard him say,
      &lsquo;Anything to get away.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor George, I know he is restless,&rdquo; said Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t go till after your birthday, Miss
      Heiress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Uncle Cosham is coming,&rdquo; said Meta. &ldquo;Margaret, you must have your
      stone laid before we go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Spencer promises it before Hector&rsquo;s holidays are over,&rdquo; said
      Margaret, blushing, as she always did, with pleasure, when they talked of
      the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hector Ernescliffe had revived Margaret wonderfully. She was seldom
      downstairs before the evening, and Ethel thought his habit of making her
      apartment his sitting-room must be as inconvenient to her as it was to
      herself; but Hector could not be de trop for Margaret. She exerted herself
      to fulfil for him all the little sisterly offices that, with her brothers,
      had been transferred to Ethel and Mary; she threw herself into all his
      schemes, tried to make him endure Captain Gordon, and she even read his
      favourite book of Wild Sports, though her feelings were constantly
      lacerated by the miseries of the slaughtered animals. Her couch was to him
      as a home, and he had awakened her bright soft liveliness which had been
      only dimmed for a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The church was her other great interest, and Dr. Spencer humoured her by
      showing her all his drawings, consulting her on every ornament, and making
      many a perspective elevation, merely that she might see the effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard and Tom made it their recreation to construct a model of the
      church as a present for her, and Tom developed a genius for carving, which
      proved a beneficial interest to keep him from surliness. He had
      voluntarily propounded his intended profession to his father, who had been
      so much pleased by his choice, that he could not but be gratified; though
      now and then ambitious fancies, and discontent with Stoneborough, combined
      to bring on his ordinary moody fits, the more, because his habitual
      reserve prevented any one from knowing what was working in his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally the Rivers&rsquo; party announced their intention of going to the Isle
      of Wight as soon as Meta had come of age; and the council of Cocksmoor,
      meeting at tea at Dr. May&rsquo;s house, decided that the foundation stone of
      the church should be laid on the day after her birthday, when there would
      be a gathering of the whole family, as Margaret wished. Dr. Spencer had
      worked incredibly hard to bring it forward, and Margaret&rsquo;s sweet smiles,
      and liquid eyes, expressed how personally thankful she felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a blessing this church has been to that poor girl,&rdquo; said Dr.
      Spencer, as he left the house with Mr. Wilmot. &ldquo;How it beguiles her out of
      her grief! I am glad she has the pleasure of the foundation; I doubt if
      she will see the consecration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said Mr. Wilmot, shocked. &ldquo;Was that attack so serious?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That recumbent position and want of exercise were certain to produce
      organic disease, and suspense and sorrow have hastened it. The death of
      Mrs. Rivers&rsquo;s poor child was the blow that called it into activity, and,
      if it last more than a year, I shall be surprised.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For such as she is, one cannot presume to wish, but her father&mdash;is
      he aware of this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He knows there is extensive damage; I think he does not open his eyes to
      the result, but he will bear it. Never was there a man to whom it came so
      naturally to live like the fowls of the air, or the lilies of the field,
      as it does to dear Dick May,&rdquo; said Dr. Spencer, his voice faltering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a strength of faith and love in him that carries him through
      all,&rdquo; said Mr. Wilmot. &ldquo;His childlike nature seems to have the
      trustfulness that is, in itself, consolation. You said how Cocksmoor had
      been blessed to Margaret&mdash;I think it is the same with them all&mdash;not
      only Ethel and Richard, who have been immediately concerned; but that one
      object has been a centre and aim to elevate the whole family, and give
      force and unity to their efforts. Even the good doctor, much as I always
      looked up to him&mdash;much good as he did me in my young days&mdash;I
      must confess that he was sometimes very provoking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you had tried to be his keeper at Cambridge, you might say so!&rdquo;
       rejoined Dr. Spencer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is so much less impetuous&mdash;more consistent&mdash;less desultory;
      I dare say you understand me,&rdquo; said Mr. Wilmot. &ldquo;His good qualities do not
      entangle one another as they used to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly so. He was far more than I looked for when I came home, though I
      might have guessed that such a disposition, backed by such principles and
      such&mdash;could not but shake off all the dross.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One thing was,&rdquo; said Mr. Wilmot, smiling, &ldquo;that a man must take himself
      in hand at some time in his life, and Dr. May only began to think himself
      responsible for himself when he lost his wife, who was wise for both. She
      was an admirable person, but not easy to know well. I think you knew her
      at&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say,&rdquo; interrupted Dr. Spencer, &ldquo;it strikes me that we could not do
      better than get up our S. P. G. demonstration on the day of the stone&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hitherto the Stoneborough subscribers to the Society for the Propagation
      of the Gospel had been few and far between; but, under the new dynasty,
      there was a talk of forming an association, and having a meeting to bring
      the subject forward. Dr. Spencer&rsquo;s proposal, however, took the vicar by
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never could there be a better time,&rdquo; he argued. &ldquo;You have naturally a
      gathering of clergy&mdash;people ought to be liberal on such an occasion,
      and, as Cocksmoor is provided for, why not give the benefit to the
      missions, in their crying need!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, but there is no time to send for any one to make a speech.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Husband your resources. What could you have better than young Harry and
      his islanders?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harry would never make a speech.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him cram Norman. Young Lake tells me Norman made a great sensation at
      the Union at Oxford, and if his heart is in the work, he must not shrink
      from the face of his townsmen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt he had rather they were savages,&rdquo; said the vicar. &ldquo;And yourself&mdash;you
      will tell them of the Indian missions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With all my heart,&rdquo; said Dr. Spencer. &ldquo;When my Brahminhee godson&mdash;the
      deacon I told you of, comes to pay me his promised visit, what doings we
      shall have! Seriously, I have just had letters from him and from others,
      that speak of such need, that I could feel every moment wasted that is not
      spent on their behalf.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wilmot was drawn into Dr. Spencer&rsquo;s house, and heard the letters, till
      his heart burned within him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The meeting was at once decided upon, though Ethel could not see why
      people could not give without speechifying, and her two younger brothers
      declared it was humbug&mdash;Tom saying, he wished all blackamoors were
      out of creation, and Harry, that he could not stand palaver about his
      friend David. Dr. May threatened him with being displayed on the platform
      as a living instance of the effects of missions, at which he took alarm,
      and so seriously declared that he should join the Bucephalus at once, that
      they pacified him by promising that he should do as he pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      The archdeacon promised a sermon, and the active Dr Spencer worked the
      nine muses and all the rest of the town and neighbourhood into a state of
      great enthusiasm and expectation. He went to the Grange, as he said, to
      collect his artillery; primed Flora that she might prime the M. P.; made
      the willing Meta promise to entrap the uncle, who was noted for
      philanthropical speeches; and himself captured Sir Henry Walkinghame, who
      looked somewhat rueful at what he found incumbent on him as a country
      gentleman, though there might be some compensation in the eagerness of
      Miss Rivers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norman had hardly set foot in Stoneborough before he was told what was in
      store for him, and, to the general surprise, submitted as if it were a
      very simple matter. As Dr. Spencer told him, it was only a foretaste of
      the penalty which every missionary has to pay for coming to England.
      Norman was altogether looking much better than when he had been last at
      home, and his spirits were more even. He had turned his whole soul to the
      career he had chosen, cast his disappointment behind him, or, more truly,
      made it his offering, and gathered strength and calmness, with which to
      set out on tasks of working for others, with thoughts too much absorbed on
      them, to give way to the propensity of making himself the primary object
      of study and contemplation. The praise of God, and love of man, were the
      best cures for tendencies like his, and he had found it out. His calm,
      though grave cheerfulness, came as a refreshment to those who had been
      uneasy about him, and mournfully watching poor Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Dr. Spencer, &ldquo;you have taken the best course for your own
      happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norman coloured, as if he understood more than met the ear. Mary and
      Blanche were very busy preparing presents for Meta Rivers, and every one
      was anxious to soften to her the thought of this first birthday without
      her father. Each of the family contributed some pretty little trifle,
      choice in workmanship or kind in device, and each was sealed and marked
      with the initials of the giver, and packed up by Mary, to be committed to
      Flora&rsquo;s charge. Blanche had, however, much trouble in extracting a gift
      from Norman, and he only yielded at last, on finding that all his brothers
      had sent something, so that his omission would be marked. Then he dived
      into the recesses of his desk, and himself sealed up a little parcel, of
      which he would not allow his sisters to inspect the contents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel had a shrewd guess. She remembered his having, in the flush of joy
      at Margaret&rsquo;s engagement, rather prematurely caused a seal to be cut with
      a daisy, and &ldquo;Pearl of the meadow&rdquo; as the motto; and his having said that
      he should keep it as a wedding present. She could understand that he was
      willing to part with it without remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora met Meta in her sitting-room, on the morning of the day, which rose
      somewhat sadly upon the young girl, as she thought of past affection and
      new responsibilities. If the fondness of a sister could have compensated
      for what she had lost, Meta received it in no scanty measure from Flora,
      who begged to call George, because he would be pleased to see the display
      of gifts.
    </p>
    <p>
      His own was the only costly one&mdash;almost all the rest were homemade
      treasures of the greater price, because the skill and fondness of the
      maker were evident in their construction; and Meta took home the kindness
      as it was meant, and felt the affection that would not let her feel
      herself lonely. She only wished to go and thank them all at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do then,&rdquo; said Flora. &ldquo;If Lord Cosham will spare you, and your business
      should be over in time, you could drive in, and try to bring papa home
      with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, thank you, Flora. That is a kind treat, in case the morning should be
      very awful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret Agatha Rivers signed her documents, listened to explanations, and
      was complimented by her uncle on not thinking it necessary to be senseless
      on money matters, like her cousin, Agatha Langdale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still she looked a little oppressed, as she locked up the tokens of her
      wealth, and the sunshine of her face did not beam out again till she
      arrived at Stoneborough, and was dispensing her pretty thanks to the few
      she found at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ethel out and Norman? His seal is only too pretty&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are all helping Dr. Spencer at Cocksmoor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a pity! But it is so very kind of him to treat me as a daisy. In
      some ways I like his present for that the best of all,&rdquo; said Meta.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell him so,&rdquo; said Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, no,&rdquo; said Meta. &ldquo;I am not pretending to be anything half so nice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary and Blanche fell upon her for calling herself anything but the nicest
      flower in the world; and she contended that she was nothing better than a
      parrot-tulip, stuck up in a parterre; and just as the discussion was
      becoming a game at romps, Dr. May came in, and the children shouted to him
      to say whether his humming-bird were a daisy or a tulip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is as she comports herself,&rdquo; he said playfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which means that you don&rsquo;t think her quite done for,&rdquo; said Meta.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not quite,&rdquo; said the doctor, with a droll intonation; &ldquo;but I have not
      seen what this morning may have done to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come and see, then,&rdquo; said Meta. &ldquo;Flora told me to bring you home&mdash;and
      it is my birthday, you know. Never mind waiting to tell Ethel. Margaret
      will let her know that I&rsquo;ll keep you out of mischief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As usual, Dr. May could not withstand her, and she carried him off in
      triumph in her pony carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t give me up yet?&rdquo; was the first thing she said, as they
      were off the stones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you been doing to make me?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doing or not doing&mdash;one or the other,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But indeed I
      wanted to have you to myself. I am in a great puzzle!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Henry! I hope she won&rsquo;t consult me!&rdquo; thought Dr. May, as he answered,
      &ldquo;Well, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear it is a lasting puzzle,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;What shall I do with all this
      money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep it in the bank, or buy railway shares!&rdquo; said Dr. May, looking arch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. That&rsquo;s a question for my cousins in the city. I want you to
      answer me as no one else can do. I want to know what is my duty now that I
      have my means in my own hands?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is need enough around&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not mean only giving a little here and there, but I want you to hear
      a few of my thoughts. Flora and George are kindness itself&mdash;but, you
      see, I have no duties. They are obliged to live a gay sort of life&mdash;it
      is their position; but I cannot make out whether it is mine. I don&rsquo;t see
      that I am like those girls who have to go out as a matter of obedience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. May considered, but could only say, &ldquo;You are very young.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too young to be independent,&rdquo; sighed Meta. &ldquo;I must grow old enough to be
      trusted alone, and in the meantime&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably an answer will be found,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;You and your means
      will find their&mdash;their vocation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marriage,&rdquo; said Meta, calmly speaking the word that he had avoided. &ldquo;I
      think not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not think good men like heiresses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He became strongly interested in a corn-field, and she resumed,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I should only do harm. It may be my duty to wait. All I wish to
      know is, whether it is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see you are not like girls who know their duty, and are restless,
      because it is not the duty they like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I like everything. It is my liking it so much that makes me afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even going to Ryde?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I like the sailing? and seeing Harry too? I don&rsquo;t feel as if that
      were waste, because I can sometimes spare poor Flora a little. We could
      not let her go alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need never fear to be without a mission of comfort,&rdquo; said Dr. May.
      &ldquo;Your &lsquo;spirit full of glee&rsquo; was given you for something. Your presence is
      far more to my poor Flora than you or she guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never meant to leave her now,&rdquo; said Meta earnestly. &ldquo;I only wished to
      be clear whether I ought to seek for my work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will seek you, when the time comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And meantime I must do what comes to hand, and take it as humiliation
      that it is not in the more obviously blessed tasks! A call might come, as
      Cocksmoor did to Ethel. But oh! my money! Ought it to be laid up for
      myself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For your call, when it comes,&rdquo; said Dr. May, smiling; then gravely,
      &ldquo;There are but too many calls for the interest. The principal is your
      trust, till the time comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meta smiled, and was pleased to think that her first-fruits would be
      offered to-morrow.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; sighed Etheldred, as she fastened her white muslin, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      afraid it is my nature to hate my neighbour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Ethel, what is coming next?&rdquo; said Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like my neighbour at home, and whom I have to work for, very much,&rdquo;
       said Ethel, &ldquo;but oh! my neighbour that I have to be civil to!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor old King! I am afraid your day will be spoiled with all your toils
      as lady of the house. I wish I could help you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me have my grumble out, and you will!&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I am sorry you have this bustle, and so many to entertain, when I
      know you would rather have the peaceful feelings belonging to the day
      undisturbed. I should like to shelter you up here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very ungrateful of me,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;when Dr. Spencer works so hard
      for us, not to be willing to grant anything to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&mdash;but then I have none of the trouble of it&mdash;I can&rsquo;t help
      liking the notion of sending out the Church to the island whence the
      Church came home to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;if we could do it without holding forth!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Ethel, it is much better than the bazaar&mdash;it is no field for
      vanity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;What a mess every one will make! Oh, if I
      could but stay away, like Harry! There will be Dr. Hoxton being sonorous
      and prosy, and Mr. Lake will stammer, and that will be nothing to the
      misery of our own people&rsquo;s work. George will flounder, and look at Flora,
      and she will sit with her eyes on the ground, and Dr. Spencer will come
      out of his proper self, and be complimentary to people who deserve it no
      more!&mdash;And Norman! I wish I could run away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard says we do not guess how well Norman speaks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard thinks Norman can do anything he can&rsquo;t do himself! It is all
      chance&mdash;he may do very well, if he gets into his &lsquo;funny state&rsquo;, but
      he always suffers for that, and he will certainly put one into an agony at
      the outset. I wish Dr. Spencer would have let him alone! And then there
      will be that Sir Henry, whom I can&rsquo;t abide! Oh, I wish I were more
      charitable, like Miss Bracy and Mary, who will think all so beautiful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So will you, when you come home,&rdquo; said Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I could only be talking to Cherry, and Dame Hall! I think the school
      children enter into it very nicely, Margaret. Did I tell you how nicely
      Ellen Reid answered about the hymn, &lsquo;From Greenland&rsquo;s icy mountains&rsquo;? She
      did not seem to have made it a mere geographical lesson, like Fanny Grigg&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel&rsquo;s misanthropy was happily conducted off via the Cocksmoor children,
      and any lingering remains were dissipated by her amusement at Dr.
      Spencer&rsquo;s ecstasy on seeing Dr. May assume his red robe of office, to go
      to the minster in state, with the Town Council. He walked round and round
      his friend, called him Nicholas Randall redivivus, quoted Dogberry, and
      affronted Gertrude, who had a dim idea that he was making game of papa.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel was one of those to whom representation was such a penance, that a
      festival, necessitating hospitality to guests of her own rank, was burden
      enough seriously to disturb the repose of thankfulness for the attainment
      of her object, and to render difficult the recueillement which she needed
      for the praise and prayer that she felt due from her, and which seemed to
      oppress her heart, by a sense of inadequacy of her partial expression. It
      was well for her that the day began with the calm service in the minster,
      where it was her own fault if cares haunted her, and she could confess the
      sin of her irritated sensations, and wishes to have all her own way, and
      then, as ever, be led aright into thanksgiving for the unlooked-for
      crowning of her labours.
    </p>
    <p>
      The archdeacon&rsquo;s sermon amplified what Margaret had that morning
      expressed, so as to carry on her sense of appropriateness in the offerings
      of the day being bestowed on distant lands.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the ordeal was yet to come, and though blaming herself, she was
      anything but comfortable, as the world repaired to the Town Hall, the room
      where the same faces so often met for such diverse purposes&mdash;now an
      orrery displayed by a conceited lecturer, now a ball, now a magistrates&rsquo;
      meeting, a concert or a poultry show, where rival Hamburg and Dorking
      uplifted their voices in the places of Mario and Grisi, all beneath the
      benignant portrait of Nicholas Randall, ruffed, robed, square-toed, his
      endowment of the scholarship in his hand, and a chequered pavement at his
      feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who knows not an S. P. G. meeting?&mdash;the gaiety of the serious, and
      the first public spectacle to the young, who, like Blanche and Aubrey,
      gaze with admiration at the rows of bonnets, and with awe at the black
      coats on the platform, while the relations of the said black coats suffer,
      like Ethel, from nervous dread of the public speaking of their best
      friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her expectations were realised by the archdeacon&rsquo;s speech, which went
      round in a circle, as if he could not find his way out of it. Lord Cosham
      was fluent, but a great many words went to very small substance; and no
      wonder, thought Ethel, when all they had to propose and second was the
      obvious fact that missions were very good things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Hoxton pompously, Sir Henry Walkinghame creditably, assisted the
      ladies and gentlemen to resolve that the S. P. G. wanted help; Mr. Lake
      made a stammering, and Mr. Rivers, with his good-natured face, hearty
      manner, and good voice, came in well after him with a straightforward,
      speech, so brief, that Ethel gave Flora credit for the best she had yet
      heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wilmot said something which the sharpest ears in the front row might,
      perhaps, have heard, and which resulted in Dr. Spencer standing up. Ethel
      hardly would have known who was speaking had her eyes been shut. His voice
      was so different, when raised and pitched, so as to show its power and
      sweetness; the fine polish of his manner was redoubled, and every sentence
      had the most graceful turn. It was like listening to a well-written book,
      so smooth and so fluent, and yet so earnest&mdash;his pictures of Indian
      life so beautiful, and his strong affection for the converts he described
      now and then making his eyes fill, and his voice falter, as if losing the
      thread of his studied composition&mdash;a true and dignified work of art,
      that made Dr. May whisper to Flora, &ldquo;You see what he can do. They would
      have given anything to have had him for a lecturer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With half a sigh, Ethel saw Norman rise, and step forward. He began, with
      eyes fixed on the ground, and in a low modest tone, to speak of the
      islands that Harry had visited; but gradually the poetic nature, inherent
      in him, gained the mastery; and though his language was strikingly simple,
      in contrast with Dr. Spencer&rsquo;s ornate periods, and free from all trace of
      &ldquo;the lamp,&rdquo; it rose in beauty and fervour at every sentence. The feelings
      that had decided his lot gave energy to his discourse, and repressed as
      they had been by reserve and diffidence, now flowed forth, and gave
      earnestness to natural gifts of eloquence of the highest order. After his
      quiet, unobtrusive beginning, there was the more wonder to find how he
      seemed to raise up the audience with him, in breathless attention, as to a
      strain of sweet music, carrying them without thought of the scene, or of
      the speaker, to the lovely isles, and the inhabitants of noble promise,
      but withering for lack of knowledge; and finally closing his speech, when
      they were wrought up to the highest pitch, by an appeal that touched them
      all home; &ldquo;for well did he know,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that the universal brotherhood
      was drawn closest in circles nearer home, that beneath the shadow of their
      own old minster, gladness and mourning floated alike for all; and that all
      those who had shared in the welcome to one, given back as it were from the
      grave, would own the same debt of gratitude to the hospitable islanders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He ceased. His father wiped his spectacles, and almost audibly murmured,
      &ldquo;Bless him!&rdquo; Ethel, who had sat like one enchanted, forgetting who spoke,
      forgetting all save the islanders, half turned, and met Richard&rsquo;s smiling
      eyes, and his whisper, &ldquo;I told you so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The impress of a man of true genius and power had been made throughout the
      whole assembly; the archdeacon put Norman out of countenance by the thanks
      of the meeting for his admirable speech, and all the world, except the
      Oxford men, were in a state of as much surprise as pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Splendid speaker, Norman May, if he would oftener put himself out,&rdquo;
       Harvey Anderson commented. &ldquo;Pity he has so many of the good doctor&rsquo;s
      prejudices!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, to be sure!&rdquo; quoth Mrs. Ledwich. &ldquo;I knew Mr. Norman was very
      clever, but I declare I never thought of such as this! I will try my poor
      utmost for those interesting natives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That youth has first-rate talents,&rdquo; said Lord Cosham. &ldquo;Do you know what
      he is designed for? I should like to bring him forward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Dr. Hoxton. &ldquo;The year I sent off May and Anderson was the
      proudest year of my life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word!&rdquo; declared Mrs. Elwood. &ldquo;That Dr. Spencer is as good as a
      book, but Mr. Norman&mdash;I say, father, we will go without the new
      clock, but we&rsquo;ll send somewhat to they men that built up the church, and
      has no minister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A good move that,&rdquo; said Dr. Spencer. &ldquo;Worth at least twenty pounds. That
      boy has the temperament of an orator, if the morbid were but a grain
      less.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Margaret,&rdquo; exclaimed Blanche. &ldquo;Dr. Spencer made the finest speech you
      ever heard, only it was rather tiresome; and Norman made everybody cry&mdash;and
      Mary worse than all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no speaking of it. One should live such things, not talk over
      them,&rdquo; said Meta Rivers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret received the reports of the select few, who visited her upstairs,
      where she was kept quiet, and only heard the hum of the swarm, whom Dr.
      May, in vehement hospitality, had brought home to luncheon, to Ethel&rsquo;s
      great dread, lest there should not be enough for them to eat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret pitied her sisters, but heard that all was going well; that Flora
      was taking care of the elders, and Harry and Mary were making the younger
      fry very merry at the table on the lawn. Dr. May had to start early to see
      a sick gardener at Drydale before coming on to Cocksmoor, and came up to
      give his daughter a few minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We get on famously,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Ethel does well when she is in for it,
      like Norman. I had no notion what was in the lad. They are perfectly
      amazed with his speech. It seems hard to give such as he is up to those
      outlandish places; but there, his speech should have taught me better&mdash;one&rsquo;s
      best&mdash;and, now and then, he seems my best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One comfort is,&rdquo; said Margaret, smiling, &ldquo;you would miss Ethel more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gallant old King! I am glad she has had her wish. Good-bye, my Margaret,
      we will think of you. I wish&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very happy,&rdquo; was Margaret&rsquo;s gentle reassurance. &ldquo;The dear little
      Daisy looks just as her godfather imagined her;&rdquo; and happy was her face
      when her father quitted her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret&rsquo;s next visitor was Meta, who came to reclaim her bonnet, and,
      with a merry smile, to leave word that she was walking on to Cocksmoor.
      Margaret remonstrated on the heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me alone,&rdquo; said she, making her pretty wilful gesture. &ldquo;Ethel and
      Mary ought to have a lift, and I have had no walking to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, you don&rsquo;t know how far it is. You can&rsquo;t go alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am lying in wait for Miss Bracy, or something innocent,&rdquo; said Meta. &ldquo;In
      good time&mdash;here comes Tom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom entered, declaring that he had come to escape from the clack
      downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll promise not to clack if you will be so kind as to take care of me to
      Cocksmoor,&rdquo; said Meta.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you intend to walk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will let me be your companion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be most happy,&rdquo; said Tom, colouring with gratification, such as
      he might not have felt, had he known that he was chosen for his innocence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took a passing glimpse at his neck-tie, screwed up the nap of his
      glossy hat to the perfection of its central point, armed himself with a
      knowing little stick, and hurried his fair companion out by the back door,
      as much afraid of losing the glory of being her sole protector as she was
      of falling in with an escort of as much consequence, in other eyes, as was
      Mr. Thomas in his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew him less than any of the rest, and her first amusement was
      keeping silence to punish him for complaining of clack; but he explained
      that he did not mean quiet, sensible conversation&mdash;he only referred
      to those foolish women&rsquo;s raptures over the gabble they had been hearing at
      the Town Hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      She exclaimed, whereupon he began to criticise the speakers with a good
      deal of acuteness, exposing the weak points, but magnanimously owning that
      it was tolerable for the style of thing, and might go down at
      Stoneborough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder you did not stay away as Harry did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought it would be marked,&rdquo; observed the thread-paper Tom, as if he
      had been at least county member.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did quite right,&rdquo; said Meta, really thinking so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wished to hear Dr. Spencer, too,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;There is a man who does
      know how to speak! He has seen something of the world, and knows what he
      is talking of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he did not come near Norman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hated listening to Norman,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;Why should he go and set his
      heart on those black savages?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are not savages in New Zealand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are all niggers together,&rdquo; said Tom vehemently. &ldquo;I cannot think why
      Norman should care for them more than for his own brothers and sisters.
      All I know is, that if I were my father, I would never give my consent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is lucky you are not,&rdquo; said Meta, smiling defiance, though a tear
      shone in her eye. &ldquo;Dr. May makes the sacrifice with a free heart and
      willing mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everybody goes and sacrifices somebody else,&rdquo; grumbled Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are the victims now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All of us. What are we to do without Norman? He is worth all of us put
      together; and I&mdash;&rdquo; Meta was drawn to the boy as she had never been
      before, as he broke off short, his face full of emotion, that made him
      remind her of his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might go out and follow in his steps,&rdquo; said she, as the most
      consoling hope she could suggest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I. Don&rsquo;t you know what is to happen to me? Ah! Flora has not told
      you. I thought she would not think it grand enough. She talked about
      diplomacy&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what?&rdquo; asked Meta anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only that I am to stick to the old shop,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell any one;
      I would not have the fellows know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean your father&rsquo;s profession?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Tom! you don&rsquo;t talk of that as if you despised it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it is good enough for him, it is good enough for me, I suppose,&rdquo; said
      Tom. &ldquo;I hate everything when I think of my brothers going over the world,
      while I, do what I will, must be tied down to this slow place all the rest
      of my days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you were away, you would be longing after it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but I can&rsquo;t get away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely, if the notion is so unpleasant to you, Dr. May would never
      insist?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my free choice, and that&rsquo;s the worst of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see? Norman told me it would be a great relief to him if I
      would turn my mind that way&mdash;and I can&rsquo;t go against Norman. I found
      he thought he must if I did not; and, you know, he is fit for all sorts of
      things that&mdash;Besides, he has a squeamishness about him, that makes
      him turn white, if one does but cut one&rsquo;s finger, and how he would ever go
      through the hospitals&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meta suspected that Tom was inclined to launch into horrors. &ldquo;So you
      wanted to spare him,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay! and papa was so pleased by my offering that I can&rsquo;t say a word of the
      bore it is. If I were to back out, it would come upon Aubrey, and he is
      weakly, and so young, that he could not help my father for many years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meta was much struck at the motives that actuated the self-sacrifice,
      veiled by the sullen manner which she almost began to respect. &ldquo;What is
      done for such reasons must make you happy,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;though there may be
      much that is disagreeable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the study,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;The science is famous work. I like what I see
      of it in my father&rsquo;s books, and there&rsquo;s a splendid skeleton at the
      hospital that I long to be at. If it were not for Stoneborough, it would
      be all very well; but, if I should get on ever so well at the
      examinations, it all ends there! I must come back, and go racing about
      this miserable circuit, just like your gold pheasant rampaging in his
      cage, seeing the same stupid people all my days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Meta, in a low, heartfelt voice, &ldquo;it is a noble, beautiful
      thing to curb down your ambition for such causes. Tom, I like you for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The glance of those beautiful eyes was worth having. Tom coloured a
      little, but assumed his usual gruffness. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear sick people,&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has always seemed to me,&rdquo; said Meta, &ldquo;that few lives could come up to
      Dr. May&rsquo;s. Think of going about, always watched for with hope, often
      bringing gladness and relief; if nothing else, comfort and kindness, his
      whole business doing good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One is paid for it,&rdquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing could ever repay Dr. May,&rdquo; said Meta. &ldquo;Can any one feel the fee
      anything but a mere form? Besides, think of the numbers and numbers that
      he takes nothing from; and oh! to how many he has brought the most real
      good, when they would have shut their doors against it in any other form!
      Oh, Tom, I think none of you guess how every one feels about your father.
      I recollect one poor woman saying, after he had attended her brother, &lsquo;He
      could not save his body, but, surely, ma&rsquo;am, I think he was the saving of
      his soul.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is of no use to talk of my being like my father,&rdquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meta thought perhaps not, but she was full of admiration of his
      generosity, and said, &ldquo;You will make it the same work of love, and charity
      is the true glory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Any inroad on Tom&rsquo;s reserved and depressed nature was a benefit; and he
      was of an age to be susceptible of the sympathy of one so pretty and so
      engaging. He had never been so much gratified or encouraged, and, wishing
      to prolong the tete-a-tete, he chose to take the short cut through the
      fir-plantations, unfrequented on account of the perpendicular, spiked
      railings that divided it from the lane.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meta was humming-bird enough to be undismayed. She put hand and foot
      wherever he desired, flattered him by letting him handily help her up, and
      bounded light as a feather down on the other side, congratulating herself
      on the change from the dusty lane to the whispering pine woods, between
      which wound the dark path, bestrewn with brown slippery needle-leaves, and
      edged with the delicate feathering ling and tufts of soft grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom had miscalculated the chances of interruption. Meta was lingering to
      track the royal highway of some giant ants to their fir-leaf hillock, when
      they were hailed from behind, and her squire felt ferocious at the sight
      of Norman and Harry closing the perspective of fir-trunks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo! Tom, what a guide you are!&rdquo; exclaimed Norman. &ldquo;That fence which
      even Ethel and Mary avoid!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary climbs like a cow, and Ethel like a father-long-legs,&rdquo; said Tom.
      &ldquo;Now Meta flies like a bird.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Tom helped me so cleverly,&rdquo; said Meta. &ldquo;It was an excellent move, to
      get into the shade and this delicious pine tree fragrance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Halt!&rdquo; said Norman&mdash;&ldquo;this is too fast for Meta.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot,&rdquo; said Harry. &ldquo;I must get there in time to set Dr. Spencer&rsquo;s
      tackle to rights. He is tolerably knowing about knots, but there is a
      dodge beyond him. Come on, Tom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew on the reluctant Etonian, who looked repiningly back at the
      increasing distance between him and the other pair, till a turn in the
      path cut off his view.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid you do not know what you have undertaken,&rdquo; said Norman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a capital walker. And I know, or do not know, how often Ethel takes
      the same walk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ethel is no rule.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She ought to be,&rdquo; said Meta. &ldquo;To be like her has always been my
      ambition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Circumstances have formed Ethel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Circumstances! What an ambiguous word! Either Providence pointing to
      duty, or the world drawing us from it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stepping-stones, or stumbling-blocks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, oh! the difficult question, when to bend them, or to bend to them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There must be always some guiding,&rdquo; said Norman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe there is,&rdquo; said Meta, &ldquo;but when trumpet-peals are ringing
      around, it is hard to know whether one is really &lsquo;waiting beside the
      tent,&rsquo; or only dawdling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is great self-denial in the immovable square not to join the charge,&rdquo;
       said Norman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but they, being shot at, are not deceiving themselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose self-deception on those points is very common.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Especially among young ladies,&rdquo; said Meta. &ldquo;I hear so much of what girls
      would do, if they might, or could, that I long to see them like Ethel&mdash;do
      what they can. And then it strikes me that I am doing the same, living
      wilfully in indulgence, and putting my trust in my own misgivings and
      discontent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have thought that discontent had as little to do with you as
      with any living creature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know how I could growl!&rdquo; said Meta, laughing. &ldquo;Though less from
      having anything to complain of, than from having nothing to complain of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean,&rdquo; he said, pausing, with a seriousness and hesitation that
      startled her&mdash;&ldquo;do you mean that this is not the course of life that
      you would choose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sort of bashfulness made her put her answer playfully&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;All play and no work makes Jack a mere toy.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Toys have a kindly mission, and I may be good for nothing else; but I
      would have rather been a coffee-pot than a china shepherdess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gaiety disconcerted him, and he seemed to try to be silent, or to
      reply in the same tone, but he could not help returning to the subject.
      &ldquo;Then you find no charm in the refinements to which you have been brought
      up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only too much,&rdquo; said Meta.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was silent, and fearing to have added to his fine-lady impression, she
      resumed. &ldquo;I mean that I never could dislike anything, and kindness gives
      these things a soul; but, of course, I should be better satisfied, if I
      lived harder, and had work to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meta!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;you tempt me very much! Would you?&mdash;No, it is
      too unreasonable. Would you share&mdash;share the work that I have
      undertaken?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned aside and leaned against a tree, as if not daring to watch the
      effect of the agitated words that had broken from him. She had little
      imagined whither his last sayings had been tending, and stood still,
      breathless with the surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; he said hastily. &ldquo;It was very wrong. I never meant to have
      vexed you by the betrayal of my vain affection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to be going, and this roused her. &ldquo;Stay, Norman,&rdquo; exclaimed she.
      &ldquo;Why should it vex me? I should like it very much indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He faced suddenly towards her&mdash;&ldquo;Meta, Meta! is it possible? Do you
      know what you are saying?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must understand me,&rdquo; said Norman, striving to speak calmly. &ldquo;You have
      been&mdash;words will not express what you have been to me for years past,
      but I thought you too far beyond my hopes. I knew I ought to be removed
      from you&mdash;I believed that those who are debarred from earthly
      happiness are marked for especial tasks. I never intended you to know what
      actuated me, and now the work is undertaken, and&mdash;and I cannot turn
      back,&rdquo; he added quickly, as if fearing himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No indeed,&rdquo; was her steady reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I may believe it!&rdquo; cried Norman. &ldquo;You do&mdash;you will&mdash;you
      deliberately choose to share it with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will try not to be a weight on you,&rdquo; answered the young girl, with a
      sweet mixture of resolution and humility. &ldquo;It would be the greatest
      possible privilege. I really do not think I am a fine lady ingrain, and
      you will teach me not to be too unworthy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? Oh, Meta, you know not what I am! Yet with you, with you to inspire,
      to strengthen, to cheer&mdash;Meta, Meta, life is so much changed before
      me, that I cannot understand it yet&mdash;after the long dreary
      hopelessness&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think why&mdash;&rdquo; Meta had half said, when feminine dignity
      checked the words, consciousness and confusion suddenly assailed her, dyed
      her cheeks crimson, and stifled her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the same with Norman, and bashfulness making a sudden prey of both&mdash;on
      they went under its dominion, in a condition partaking equally of
      discomfort and felicity; dreading the sound of their own voices, afraid of
      each other&rsquo;s faces, feeling they were treating each other very strangely
      and ungratefully, yet without an idea what to say next, or the power of
      speaking first; and therefore pacing onwards, looking gravely straight
      along the path, as if to prevent the rabbits and foxgloves from guessing
      that anything had been passing between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. May had made his call at Drydale, and was driving up a rough lane,
      between furzy banks, leading to Cocksmoor, when he was aware of a tall
      gentleman on one side of the road and a little lady on the other, with the
      whole space of the cart-track between them, advancing soberly towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo! Why, Meta! Norman! what brings you here? Where are you going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norman perceived that he had turned to the left instead of to the right,
      and was covered with shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all your wits are good for. It is well I met you, or you would
      have led poor Meta a pretty dance! You will know better than to trust
      yourself to the mercies of a scholar another time. Let me give you a
      lift.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The courteous doctor sprang out to hand Meta in, but something made him
      suddenly desire Adams to drive on, and then turning round to the two young
      people, he said, &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Norman, taking her hand, and drawing her towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, Meta, my pretty one, is it really so? Is he to be happy after all?
      Are you to be a Daisy of my own?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will let me,&rdquo; murmured Meta, clinging to her kind old friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No flower on earth could come so naturally to us,&rdquo; said Dr. May. &ldquo;And,
      dear child, at last I may venture to tell you that you have a sanction
      that you will value more than mine. Yes, my dear, on the last day of your
      dear father&rsquo;s life, when some foreboding hung upon him, he spoke to me of
      your prospects, and singled out this very Norman as such as he would
      prefer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meta&rsquo;s tears prevented all, save the two little words, &ldquo;thank you;&rdquo; but
      she put out her hand to Norman, as she still rested on the doctor&rsquo;s arm,
      more as if he had been her mother than Norman&rsquo;s father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he?&rdquo; from Norman, was equally inexpressive of the almost incredulous
      gratitude and tenderness of his feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would not bear talking over at that moment, and Dr. May presently broke
      the silence in a playful tone. &ldquo;So, Meta, good men don&rsquo;t like heiresses?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite true,&rdquo; said Meta, &ldquo;it was very much against me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or it may be the other way,&rdquo; said Norman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? Good men don&rsquo;t like heiresses&mdash;here&rsquo;s a man who likes an heiress&mdash;therefore
      here&rsquo;s a man that is not good? Ah, ha! Meta, you can see that is false
      logic, though I&rsquo;ve forgotten mine. And pray, miss, what are we to say to
      your uncle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He cannot help it,&rdquo; said Meta quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; said the doctor, laughing, &ldquo;we remember our twenty-one years, do
      we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not mean&mdash;I hope I said nothing wrong,&rdquo; said Meta, in blushing
      distress. &ldquo;Only after what you said, I can care for nothing else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I could only thank him,&rdquo; said Norman fervently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you know how to do that, my boy,&rdquo; said Dr. May, looking
      tenderly at the fairy figure between them, and ending with a sigh,
      remembering, perhaps, the sense of protection with which he had felt
      another Margaret lean on his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clatter of horses&rsquo; hoofs caused Meta to withdraw her hand, and Norman
      to retreat to his own side of the lane, as Sir Henry Walkinghame and his
      servant overtook them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will be in good time for the proceedings,&rdquo; called out the doctor.
      &ldquo;Tell them we are coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not know you were walking,&rdquo; said Sir Henry to Meta.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is pleasant in the plantations,&rdquo; Dr. May answered for her; &ldquo;but I am
      afraid we are late, and our punctual friends will be in despair. Will you
      kindly say we are at hand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Henry rode on, finding that he was not to be allowed to walk his horse
      with them, and that Miss Rivers had never looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Sir Henry!&rdquo; said Dr. May.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has no right to be surprised,&rdquo; said Meta, very low.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so you were marching right upon Drydale!&rdquo; continued Dr. May, not able
      to help laughing. &ldquo;It was a happy dispensation that I met you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am so glad of it!&rdquo; said Meta.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Though to be sure you were disarming suspicion by so cautiously keeping
      the road between you. I should never have guessed what you had been at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a little pause, then Meta said, rather tremulously, &ldquo;Please&mdash;I
      think it should be known at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our idle deeds confessed without loss of time, miss?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norman came across the path, saying, &ldquo;Meta is right&mdash;it should be
      known.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think Uncle Cosham would object, especially hearing it while he
      is here,&rdquo; said Meta&mdash;&ldquo;and if he knew what you told us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He goes to-morrow, does he not?&rdquo; said Dr. May.
    </p>
    <p>
      A silence of perplexity ensued. Meta, brave as she was, hardly knew her
      uncle enough to volunteer, and Norman was privately devising a beginning
      by the way of George, when Dr. May said, &ldquo;Well, since it is not a case for
      putting Ethel in the forefront, I must e&rsquo;en get it over for you, I
      suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, thank you,&rdquo; they cried both at once, feeling that he was the proper
      person in every way, and Norman added, &ldquo;The sooner the better, if Meta&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, yes, the sooner the better,&rdquo; exclaimed Meta. &ldquo;And let me tell
      Flora&mdash;poor dear Flora&mdash;she is always so kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A testimony that was welcome to Dr. May, who had once, at least, been
      under the impression that Flora courted Sir Henry&rsquo;s attentions to her
      sister-in-law.
    </p>
    <p>
      Further consultation was hindered by Tom and Blanche bursting upon them
      from the common, both echoing Norman&rsquo;s former reproach of &ldquo;A pretty
      guide!&rdquo; and while Blanche explained the sufferings of all the assembly at
      their tardiness, Tom, without knowing it, elucidated what had been a
      mystery to the doctor, namely, how they ever met, by his indignation at
      Norman&rsquo;s having assumed the guidance for which he was so unfit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A shocking leader; Meta will never trust him again,&rdquo; said Dr. May.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still Blanche thought them not nearly sufficiently sensible of their
      enormities, and preached eagerly about their danger of losing
      standing-room, when they emerged on the moor, and beheld a crowd, above
      whose heads rose the apex of a triangle, formed by three poles, sustaining
      a rope and huge stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here comes Dr. Spencer,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I hope he will scold you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whatever Dr. Spencer might have suffered, he was far too polite to scold,
      and a glance between the two physicians ended in a merry twinkle of his
      bright eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This way,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;we are all ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where&rsquo;s my little Daisy?&rdquo; said Dr. May.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see her in a minute. She is as good as gold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew them on up the bank&mdash;people making way for them&mdash;till he
      had stationed them among the others of their own party, beside the deep
      trench that traced the foundation, around a space that seemed far too
      small.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearly at the same moment began the soft clear sound of chanting wafted
      upon the wind, then dying away&mdash;carried off by some eddying breeze,
      then clear, and coming nearer and nearer.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
             I will not suffer mine eyes to sleep,
                Nor mine eye-lids to slumber:
             Neither the temples of my head to take any rest;
             Until I find out a place for the temple of the Lord:
             An habitation for the mighty God of Jacob.
</pre>
    <p>
      Few, who knew the history of Cocksmoor, could help glancing towards the
      slight girl, who stood, with bent head, her hand clasped over little
      Aubrey&rsquo;s; while, all that was not prayer and thanksgiving in her mind, was
      applying the words to him, whose head rested in the Pacific isle, while,
      in the place which he had chosen, was laid the foundation of the temple
      that he had given unto the Lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      There came forth the procession: the minster choristers, Dr. Spencer as
      architect, and, in her white dress, little Gertrude, led between Harry and
      Hector, Margaret&rsquo;s special choice for the occasion, and followed by the
      Stoneborough clergy.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
             Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness.
</pre>
    <p>
      It came in well with the gentle, meek, steadfast face of the young curate
      of Cocksmoor, as he moved on in his white robe, and the sunlight shone
      upon his fair hair, and calm brow, thankful for the past, and hoping, more
      than fearing, for the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prayers were said, and there was a pause, while Dr. Spencer and the
      foreman advanced to the machine and adjusted it. The two youths then led
      forward the little girl, her innocent face and large blue eyes wearing a
      look of childish obedient solemnity, only half understanding what she did,
      yet knowing it was something great.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was very pretty to see her in the midst of the little gathering round
      the foundation, the sturdy workman smiling over his hod of mortar, Dr.
      Spencer&rsquo;s silver locks touching her flaxen curls as he held the shining
      trowel to her, and Harry&rsquo;s bright head and hardy face, as he knelt on one
      knee to guide the little soft hand, while Hector stood by, still and
      upright, his eyes fixed far away, as if his thoughts were roaming to the
      real founder.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Victoria coins were placed&mdash;Gertrude scooped up the mass of
      mortar, and spread it about with increasing satisfaction, as it went so
      smoothly and easily, prolonging the operation, till Harry drew her back,
      while, slowly down creaked the ponderous corner-stone into the bed that
      she had prepared for it, and, with a good will, she gave three taps on it
      with her trowel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry had taken her hand, when, at the sight of Dr. May, she broke from
      him, and, as if taking sudden fright at her own unwonted part, ran, at
      full speed, straight up to her father, and clung to him, hiding her face
      as he raised her in his arms and kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the strain arose:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
             Thou heavenly, new Jerusalem,
             Vision of peace, in Prophet&rsquo;s dream;
             With living stones, built up on high,
             And rising to the starry sky&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      The blessing of peace seemed to linger softly and gently in the fragrant
      summer breeze, and there was a pause ere the sounds of voices awoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Etheldred&mdash;&rdquo; Mr. Wilmot stood beside her, ere going to unrobe in the
      school&mdash;&ldquo;Etheldred, you must once let me say, God bless you for
      this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she knelt beside her sister&rsquo;s sofa, on her return home, Margaret
      pressed something into her hand. &ldquo;If you please, dearest, give this to Dr.
      Spencer, and ask him to let it be set round the stem of the chalice,&rdquo; she
      whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel recognised Alan Ernescliffe&rsquo;s pearl hoop, the betrothal ring, and
      looked at her sister without a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish it,&rdquo; said Margaret gently. &ldquo;I shall like best to know it there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Margaret joined in Alan&rsquo;s offering, and Ethel dared say no more, as she
      thought how the &ldquo;relic of a frail love lost&rdquo; was becoming the &ldquo;token of
      endless love begun.&rdquo; There was more true union in this, than in clinging
      to the mere tangible emblem&mdash;for broken and weak is all affection
      that is not knit together above in the One Infinite Love.

      CHAPTER XXIII.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Of lowly fields you think no scorn,
     Yet gayest gardens would adorn,
        And grace wherever set;
     Home, seated in your lowly bower,
     Or wedded, a transplanted flower,

</pre>
    <p>
      George Rivers had an antipathy to ladies&rsquo; last words keeping the horses
      standing, and his wife and sister dutifully seated themselves in the
      carriage at once, without an attempt to linger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four of the young gentlemen were to walk across to Abbotstoke and dine at
      the Grange; and Tom, who, reasoning from analogy, had sent on his black
      tie and agate studs, was so dismally disconcerted on finding that Norman
      treated his own going as a matter of course, that Richard, whose chief use
      of his right of primogeniture was to set himself aside, discovered that he
      was wanted at home, and that Tom would be much better at the Grange,
      offering, at the same time, to send Norman&rsquo;s dressing things by Dr.
      Spencer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which,&rdquo; observed Thomas, &ldquo;he would never have recollected for himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom would have had to lend him the precious studs.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;He would not
      have had them; who would wear imitation?&rdquo; &ldquo;I say, Tom, what did you give
      for them?&rdquo; &ldquo;Better ask what the Jew gave for them, that bought them at
      Windsor Fair; not a bad imitation, either&mdash;pity they weren&rsquo;t
      Malachite; but, no doubt, the Jew thought green would be personal.&rdquo; &ldquo;As if
      they had any business to talk, who didn&rsquo;t know a respectable stud when
      they saw it&mdash;Harry, especially, with his hat set on the back of his
      head, like a sailor on the stage&rdquo;&mdash;(a leap to set it to rights&mdash;a
      skirmish, knocking Tom nearly into the ditch). &ldquo;Fine experience of the
      stage&mdash;all came from Windsor Fair.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ay, Hector might talk, but
      didn&rsquo;t he pay a shilling to see the Irish giant. He wouldn&rsquo;t confess, but
      it was a famous take in&mdash;giant had potatoes in his shoes.&rdquo; &ldquo;Not he;
      he was seven feet ten high.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ay, when he stood upon a stool&mdash;Hector
      would swallow anything&mdash;even the lady of a million postage stamps had
      not stuck in his throat&mdash;he had made Margaret collect for her.&rdquo; &ldquo;And,
      had not Tom, himself, got a bottle of ointment to get the red out of his
      hair?&rdquo;&mdash;(great fury). &ldquo;His hair wasn&rsquo;t red&mdash;didn&rsquo;t want to
      change the colour&mdash;not half so red as Hector&rsquo;s own.&rdquo; &ldquo;What was it
      then? lively auburn?&rdquo; But for fear of Norman&rsquo;s losing his bearings, Harry
      would fetch a carrot, to compare. &ldquo;Better colour than theirs could ever
      be.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then what was the ointment for? to produce whiskers? that was the
      reason Tom oiled himself like a Loyalty islander&mdash;his hair was so
      shiny, that Harry recommended a top-knot, like theirs, etc.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norman was, like the others, in such towering glee, and took so full a
      share of the witticisms, that were the more noisily applauded, the worse
      they were, that Harry suggested that &ldquo;old June had lost his way, and found
      his spirits in Drydale&mdash;he must have met with a private grog-shop in
      the plantations&mdash;would not Tom confess&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;not he; it was all in
      private. He thought it was laughing-gas, or the reaction of being fried
      all the morning, holding forth in that Town Hall. He had longed to make a
      speech himself&mdash;no end of the good it would have done the old stagers
      to come out with something to the purpose. What would old Hoxton have
      thought of it?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;They shall dive for alligators, catch the wild goats by the beard;
  Whistle to the cockatoos, and mock the hairy-faced baboon;
  Worship mighty Mumbo Jumbo in the mountains of the moon.
  I myself, in far Timbuctoo, leopard&rsquo;s blood shall daily quaff;
  Ride a tiger hunting, mounted on a thoroughbred giraffe.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not you, Tom!&rdquo; cried Hector.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;You, the swell, the Eton fellow!  You, to seek such horrid places.
  You to haunt with squalid negroes, blubber lips, and monkey faces.
  Fool, again the dream, the fancy; don&rsquo;t I know the words are mad,
  For you count the gray barbarian lower than the Brocas cad!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, it is the consequence of misanthropy at the detection of the frauds
      of unsophisticated society,&rdquo; said Norman.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                    The edge of life is rusted;
 The agate studs and whisker ointment left him very much disgusted.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it was Miss Rivers forsaking him. Was not that rather
      spider-hearted, Tom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Harry, it is time to have done. We are getting into civilised
      society&mdash;here&rsquo;s Abbotstoke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Norman, he is very far gone! He takes that scarecrow for civilised
      society!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much better clothed than the society you have been accustomed to, July.&rdquo;
       &ldquo;What a prize his wardrobe would be to the Black Prince!&rdquo; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t insult
      your betters!&rdquo; &ldquo;Which? The scarecrow, or the Black Prince?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norman tried to call his companions to order, for they were close upon the
      village, and he began to tax himself with unbecoming levity; the effect of
      spirits pitched rather low, which did not easily find their balance, under
      unwonted exhilaration, but Harry&rsquo;s antics were less easily repressed than
      excited, and if Tom had not heard the Grange clock strike half-past six,
      and had not been afraid of not having time to array himself, and watch
      over Harry&rsquo;s neckcloth, they would hardly have arrived in reasonable time.
      Dr. May had gone home, and there was no one in the drawing-room; but, as
      Norman was following the boys upstairs, Flora opened her sitting-room
      door, and attracted his attention by silently putting her cold fingers
      into his hand, and drawing him into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Norman, this is pleasant,&rdquo; she said affectionately; but in a voice
      so sunken, that all gladness seemed to be dead within, and the effect was
      far more mournful than if she had not attempted to smile congratulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will give you till Dr. Spencer comes,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Then Norman can
      dress, and you must be a good child, and come down to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The playfulness ill suited the wan, worn face that seemed to have caught a
      gray tint from her rich poplin, her full toilet making the contrast almost
      more painful; and, as she closed the door, her brother could only exclaim,
      &ldquo;Poor Flora!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is so kind,&rdquo; said the voice of the white figure that moved towards
      him. &ldquo;Oh, if we could comfort her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trust to her own kindness working comfort to her, at last,&rdquo; said
      Norman. &ldquo;But is she often thus?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whenever she is not bearing up for George&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; said Meta. &ldquo;She never
      says anything when she is alone with me, only she does not struggle with
      her looks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be very trying for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, I feel grateful to her for even so far relaxing the restraint. If I
      could but do her any good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot help doing her good,&rdquo; said Norman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meta sighed, and shook her head slightly, as she said, &ldquo;She is so gentle
      and considerate. I think this has been no fresh pain to her to-day, but I
      cannot tell. The whole day has been a strange intermixture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The two strands of joy and grief have been very closely twisted,&rdquo; said
      Norman. &ldquo;That rose is shedding its fragrant leaves in its glory, and there
      is much that should have chastened the overflowing gladness of to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I was thinking,&rdquo; whispered Meta, venturing nearer to him, and looking
      into his face with the sweet reliance of union in thought. She meant him
      to proceed, but he paused, saying, &ldquo;You were thinking-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had rather hear it from you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it not that we were taught to-day what is enduring, and gives true
      permanence and blessedness to such&mdash;to what there was between
      Ernescliffe and Margaret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her dewy eyes, and face of deep emotion, owned that he had interpreted her
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Theirs would, indeed, be a disheartening example,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if it did
      not show the strength and peace that distance, sickness, death, cannot
      destroy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. To see that church making Margaret happy as she lies smiling on her
      couch, is a lesson of lessons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That what is hallowed must be blest,&rdquo; said Norman; &ldquo;whatever the sundry
      and manifold changes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Each was far too humble to deny aloud any inequality with the goodness of
      Alan and Margaret, knowing that it would be at once disputed, trusting to
      time to prevent the over-estimate, and each believing the other was the
      one to bring the blessing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Meta,&rdquo; said Norman, &ldquo;have you heard nothing of&mdash;of the elders?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Meta, smiling, &ldquo;have not you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have seen no one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have!&rdquo; said Meta merrily. &ldquo;Uncle Cosham is delighted. That speech of
      yours has captivated him. He calls me a wise little woman to have found
      out your first-rate abilities. There&rsquo;s for you, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand it! Surely he must be aware of my intentions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said nothing about them; but, of course, Dr. May must have mentioned
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have thought so, but I cannot suppose&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That he would be willing to let me go,&rdquo; said Meta. &ldquo;But then you know he
      cannot help it,&rdquo; added she, with a roguish look, at finding herself making
      one of her saucy independent speeches.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you are taking a would-be missionary instead of Norman May!&rdquo; he
      answered, with a sort of teasing sweetness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All would-be missionaries did not make dear papa so fond of them,&rdquo; said
      Meta, very low; &ldquo;and you would not be Norman May without such purposes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The purpose was not inspired at first by the highest motive,&rdquo; said
      Norman; &ldquo;but it brought me peace, and, after the kind of dedication that I
      inwardly made of myself in my time of trouble, it would take some weighty
      reason, amounting to a clear duty, or physical impossibility, to make me
      think I ought to turn back. I believe&rdquo;&mdash;the tears rose to his eyes,
      and he brought out the words with difficulty&mdash;&ldquo;that, if this greatest
      of all joys were likely to hinder me from my calling, I ought to seek
      strength to regard it as a temptation, and to forgo it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought, if it were so,&rdquo; said Meta, nevertheless holding him tighter.
      &ldquo;I could not bear to keep back a soldier. If this were last year, and I
      had any tie or duty here, it would be very hard. But no one needs me, and
      if the health I have always had be continued to me, I don&rsquo;t think I shall
      be much in the way. There,&rdquo;&mdash;drawing back a little, and trying to
      laugh off her feeling&mdash;&ldquo;only tell me at once if you think me still
      too much of a fine lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;you&mdash;a fine lady! Did anything ever give you the impression
      that I did?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not get poor Harry into a scrape, shall I? He told me that you
      said so, last spring, and I feared you judged me too truly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a few exclamations of utter surprise, it flashed on Norman. &ldquo;I know,
      I know&mdash;Harry interpreted my words in his own blunt fashion!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you did say something like it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but&mdash;but&mdash;In short, Meta, these sailors&rsquo; imaginations go to
      great lengths. Harry had guessed more than I knew myself, before he had
      sailed, and taxed me with it. It was a subject I could not bear then, and
      I answered that you were too far beyond my hopes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Six years ago!&rdquo; said Meta slowly, blushing deeper and deeper. &ldquo;Some eyes
      saw it all that time, and you&mdash;and,&rdquo; she added, laughing, though
      rather tearfully, &ldquo;I should never have known it, if Tom had not taken me
      through the plantations!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not if I had not discovered that your preferences did not lie&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Among boudoirs and balls?&rdquo; said Meta. &ldquo;Harry was right. You thought me a
      fine lady after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gay taunt was cut short by a tap at the door, and Flora looked in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Spencer has brought your things, Norman. I am sorry to disturb you&mdash;but
      come down, Meta&mdash;I ran away very uncivilly to fetch you. I hope it is
      not too cruel,&rdquo; as she drew Meta&rsquo;s arm into her own, and added, &ldquo;I have
      not been able speak to George.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meta suspected that, in the wish to spare her, Flora had abstained from
      seeking him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening went off like any other evening&mdash;people ate and talked,
      thought Mrs. Rivers looking very ill, and Miss Rivers very pretty&mdash;Flora
      forced herself into being very friendly to Sir Henry, commiserating the
      disappointment to which she had led him; and she hoped that he suspected
      the state of affairs, though Tom, no longer supplanted by his elder
      brother, pursued Meta into the sheltered nook, where Flora had favoured
      her seclusion, to apologise for having left her to the guidance of poor
      Norman, whose head was with the blackamoors. It was all Harry&rsquo;s fault.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, Tom,&rdquo; said Harry; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you think Norman is better company
      than you any day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why did you not walk him off instead of me?&rdquo; said Tom, turning round
      sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out of consideration for Meta. She will tell you that she was very much
      obliged to me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harry checked himself, for Meta was colouring so painfully that his own
      sunburned face caught the glow. He pushed Tom&rsquo;s slight figure aside with a
      commanding move of his broad hand, and said, &ldquo;I beg your pardon, upon my
      word, though I don&rsquo;t know what for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; said Meta, rallying herself, and smiling. &ldquo;You have no pardon to
      beg. You will know it all to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I know it now,&rdquo; said Harry, sheltering his face by leaning over the
      back of a chair, and taming the hearty gaiety of his voice. &ldquo;Well done,
      Meta; there&rsquo;s nothing like old June in all the world! You may take my word
      for it, and I knew you would have the sense to find it out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were well out of sight, and Meta only answered by a good tight
      squeeze of his kind hand between both her own. Tom, suddenly recovering
      from his displeasure at being thrust aside, whisked round, dropped on a
      footstool before Meta, looked up in her face, and said, &ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; in such
      utter amazement that there was nothing for it but to laugh more
      uncontrollably than was convenient. &ldquo;Come along, Tom,&rdquo; said Harry, pulling
      him up by force, &ldquo;she does not want any of your nonsense. We will not
      plague her now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Harry,&rdquo; said Meta. &ldquo;I cannot talk rationally just yet. Don&rsquo;t
      think me unkind, Tom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom sat in a sort of trance all the rest of the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Cosham talked to Norman, who felt as if he were being patronised on
      false pretences, drew into his shell, and displayed none of his
      &ldquo;first-rate abilities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Spencer discussed his architecture with the archdeacon; but his black
      eyes roamed heedfully after the young gentleman and lady, in the opposite
      corners of the room; and, as he drove home afterwards with the youths, he
      hummed scraps of Scottish songs, and indulged in silent smiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those at home had been far more demonstrative. Dr. May had arrived,
      declaring himself the proudest doctor in her Majesty&rsquo;s dominions, and
      Ethel needed nothing but his face to explain why, and tell her that dear
      old June&rsquo;s troubles were over, and their pretty little Meta was their own&mdash;a
      joy little looked for to attend their foundation-stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dreaded conference with Lord Cosham had proved highly gratifying.
      There might be something in the fact that he could not help it, which
      assisted in his ready acquiescence, but he was also a sensible
      right-minded man, who thought that the largeness of Meta&rsquo;s fortune was no
      reason that it should be doubled; considered that, in the matter of
      connection, the May family had the advantage, and saw in Norman; a young
      man whom any one might have pleasure in bringing forward. Oxford had
      established confidence both in his character and talents, and his speech
      had been such as to impress an experienced man, like Lord Cosham, with an
      opinion of his powers, that prepared a welcome for him, such as no one
      could have dared to expect. His lordship thought his niece not only likely
      to be happier, but to occupy a more distinguished position with such a man
      as Norman May, than with most persons of ready-made rank and fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blushing and delighted Dr. May had thought himself bound to speak of
      his son&rsquo;s designs, but he allowed that the project had been formed under
      great distress of mind, and when he saw it treated by so good a man, as a
      mere form of disappointed love, he felt himself reprieved from the hardest
      sacrifice that he had ever been called on to make, loved little Meta the
      better for restoring his son, and once more gave a free course to the
      aspirations that Norman&rsquo;s brilliant boyhood had inspired. Richard took the
      same view, and the evening passed away in an argument&mdash;as if any one
      had been disputing with them&mdash;the father reasoning loud, the son
      enforcing it low, that it had become Norman&rsquo;s duty to stay at home to take
      care of Meta, whose father would have been horrified at his taking her to
      the Antipodes. They saw mighty tasks for her fortune to effect in England,
      they enhanced each other&rsquo;s anticipations of Norman&rsquo;s career, overthrew
      abuses before him, heaped distinctions upon him, and had made him Prime
      Minister and settled his policy, before ten o&rsquo;clock brought their schemes
      to a close.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary gazed and believed; Margaret lay still and gently assented; Ethel was
      silent at first, and only when the fabric became extremely airy and
      magnificent, put in her word with a vehement dash at the present abuses,
      which grieved her spirit above all, and, whether vulnerable or not, Norman
      was to dispose of, like so many giants before Mr. Great-heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went upstairs, unable to analyse her sentiments. To be spared the
      separation would be infinite relief&mdash;all this prosperity made her
      exult&mdash;the fair girl at the Grange was the delight of her heart, and
      yet there was a sense of falling off; she disliked herself for being
      either glad or sorry, and could have quarrelled with the lovers for
      perplexing her feelings so uncomfortably.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though she sat up till the party returned, she was inclined to be supposed
      in bed, so as to put off the moment of meeting; but Margaret, who she
      hoped was asleep, said from her pillow, &ldquo;Ask dear Norman to let me give
      him one kiss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She ran down headlong, clutched Norman as he was taking off his greatcoat,
      told him that Margaret wanted him, and dragged him up without letting him
      go, till she reached the first landing, where she stood still, saying
      breathlessly, &ldquo;New Zealand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I wished to fail, she would keep me to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said Ethel, claiming heartily his caress. &ldquo;I was
      wrong to doubt either of you. Now, I know how to feel! But Margaret must
      not wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The happy youth, in the flush of love and joy, bent gently, almost
      tearfully, down in silence to the white form, half seen in the twilight,
      whose hopes had fleeted away from earth, and who was calmly, softly
      gliding after them. Hardly a word was uttered, but of all the many
      heartfelt thoughts that had passed while the face was pressed into
      Margaret&rsquo;s pillow, and her sympathising arms round the neck, surely none
      was ever deeper, than was his prayer and vow that his affection should be
      like hers, unearthly, and therefore enduring.
    </p>
    <p>
      The embrace was all; Margaret must not be agitated, and, indeed, the
      events of the day had been too much for her, and the ensuing morning
      brought the fluttering of heart and prostration of strength, no longer a
      novelty and occasion of immediate terror, but the token of the waning
      power of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Till she was better, her father had no thoughts for aught else, but, as
      with many another invalid, the relief from present distress was as
      cheering as if it had been recovery, and ere night, her placid look of
      repose had returned, and she was devising pretty greetings for her newest
      Daisy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps the sobering effect of these hours of anxiety was in Norman&rsquo;s
      favour, on entering into conversation with his father. Those visions,
      which had had their swing the night before, belonged to the earlier, more
      untamed period of Dr. May&rsquo;s life, and had melted away in the dim room,
      made sacred by lingering mementos of his wife, and in the sound of that
      panting breath and throbbing heart. His vehemence had been, after all,
      chiefly against his own misgivings, and when he heard of his son&rsquo;s
      resolution, and Meta&rsquo;s more than acquiescence, he was greatly touched, and
      recurred to his kind, sorrowful promise, that he would never be a
      stumbling-block in the path of his children. Still he owned himself
      greatly allured by the career proposed by Lord Cosham, and thought Norman
      should consider the opportunities of doing good in, perhaps, a still more
      important and extensive field than that which he had chosen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time was that I should have grasped at such a prospect,&rdquo; said Norman;
      &ldquo;but I am not the man for it. I have too much ambition, and too little
      humility. You know, father, how often you have had to come to my rescue,
      when I was running after success as my prime object.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vanity fair is a dangerous place, but you who have sound principles and
      pure motives&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long would my motives be pure?&rdquo; said Norman. &ldquo;Rivalry and
      party-spirit make me distrust my motives, and then my principles feel the
      shock. Other men are marked by station for such trials, and may be carried
      through them, but I am not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet some of these men are far from your equals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not perhaps in speechifying,&rdquo; said Norman, smiling; &ldquo;but in steadiness of
      aim, in patience, in callousness, in seeing one side of the question at
      once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You judge rightly for your own peace; you will be the happier; I always
      doubted whether you had nerve to make your wits available.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be cowardice,&rdquo; said Norman, &ldquo;but I think not. I could burn for the
      combat; and if I had no scruples, I could enjoy bearing down such as&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of course Dr. May burst in with a political name, and&mdash;&ldquo;I wish you
      were at him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whether I could is another matter,&rdquo; said Norman, laughing; &ldquo;but the fact
      is, that I stand pledged; and if I embraced what to me would be a worldly
      career, I should be running into temptation, and could not expect to be
      shielded from it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your old rule,&rdquo; said Dr. May. &ldquo;Seek to be less rather than more. But
      there is another choice. Why not a parsonage at home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pleasant parishes are not in the same need,&rdquo; said Norman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder what poor old Rivers would say to you, if he knew what you want
      to do with his daughter! Brought up as she has been&mdash;to expose her to
      the roughness of a colonial life, such as I should hesitate about for your
      sisters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is her own ardent desire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, but are girlish enthusiasms to be trusted? Take care, Norman, take
      care of her&mdash;she is a bit of the choicest porcelain of human kind,
      and not to be rudely dealt with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed, but she has the brave enterprising temper, to which I fully
      believe that actual work, in a good cause, is far preferable to what she
      calls idleness. I do not believe that we are likely to meet with more
      hardship than she would gladly encounter, and would almost&mdash;nay,
      quite enjoy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not know what your aunt has had to go through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A few years make a great difference in a colony. Still, it may be right
      for me to go out alone and judge for her; but we shall know more if my
      aunt comes home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I could trust a good deal to her. She has much of your mother&rsquo;s
      sense. Well, you must settle it as you can with Meta&rsquo;s people! I do not
      think they love the pretty creature better than I have done from the first
      minute we saw her&mdash;don&rsquo;t you remember it, Norman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember it? Do I not? From the frosted cedar downwards! It was the first
      gem of spring in that dreary winter. What a Fairyland the Grange was to
      me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may nearly say the same of me,&rdquo; confessed Dr. May, smiling; &ldquo;the
      sight of that happy little sunny spirit, full of sympathy and sweetness,
      always sent me brighter on my way. Wherever you may be, Norman, I am glad
      you have her, being one apt to need a pocket sunbeam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope my tendencies are in no danger of depressing her!&rdquo; said Norman,
      startled. &ldquo;If so&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No such thing&mdash;she will make a different man of you. You have been
      depressed by&mdash;that early shock, and the gap at our own fireside&mdash;all
      that we have shared together, Norman. To see you begin on a new score,
      with a bright home of your own, is the best in this world that I could
      wish for you, though I shall live over my own twenty-two years in thinking
      of you, and that sweet little fairy. But now go, Norman&mdash;she will be
      watching for you and news of Margaret. Give her all sorts of love from
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norman fared better with the uncle than he had expected. Lord Cosham, as a
      philanthropist, could not, with any consistency, set his face against
      missions, even when the cost came so near home; and he knew that
      opposition made the like intentions assume a heroic aspect that maintained
      them in greater force. He therefore went over the subject in a calm
      dispassionate manner, which exacted full and grateful consideration from
      the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The final compromise was, that nothing should be settled for a year,
      during which Norman would complete his course of study, and the matter
      might be more fully weighed. Mrs. Arnott would probably return, and bring
      experience and judgment, which would, or ought to, decide the question&mdash;though
      Meta had a secret fear that it might render it more complicated than ever.
      However, the engagement and the mission views had both been treated so
      much more favourably than could have been hoped, that they felt themselves
      bound to be patient and forbearing. As Meta said, &ldquo;If they showed
      themselves wilful children, they certainly did not deserve to be trusted
      anywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Cosham made his niece listen to a kind exhortation not to press her
      influence towards a decision that might be repented, when too late to be
      repaired, without a degrading sense of failure&mdash;putting her in mind
      of the privations that would lose romance by their pettiness, and which
      money could not remedy; and very sensibly representing that the effect of
      these on temper and health was to be duly considered as a serious
      impediment to usefulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be worse for him alone,&rdquo; said Meta.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not certain,&rdquo; said her uncle. &ldquo;A broken-down wife is a terrible
      drag.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it is so,&rdquo; said Meta firmly, &ldquo;but risks must be run, and he is
      willing to take the chance. I do not think it can be presumption, for, you
      know, I am strong; and Dr. May would say if he could not warrant me. I
      fancy household work would be more satisfactory and less tiring than doing
      a season thoroughly, and I mean to go through a course of Finchley manuals
      in preparation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you know what you are doing,&rdquo; sighed her uncle. &ldquo;You see it all
      couleur de rose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think not. It is because it is not couleur de rose that I am so much
      bent upon it. I have had plenty of that all my life. I expect much that
      will be very disagreeable and not at all heroic; but if I can only make
      Norman think it fun, that will be one purpose answered. I do believe he
      will do his work better for having me, and, at least, I shall pay his
      passage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her uncle shook his head, but did not try to say any more. George had
      begun by loud exclamations against the project, in which he was vehemently
      abetted by Tom, who primed him with all sorts of outrageous abuse of the
      niggers and cannibals, who would make Norman&rsquo;s coats out of all shape, and
      devour little Meta at a mouthful&mdash;predictions which Meta accepted
      most merrily, talking of herself so resignedly, as bound upon a spit, and
      calling out to be roasted slower and faster, that she safely conducted off
      their opposition by way of a standing joke. As to Norman&rsquo;s coats, she
      threatened to make them herself, and silenced Tom for ever by supposing,
      in malicious simplicity, that he must be able to teach her the most
      unexceptional cut.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora kept her opinions to herself. Only once, when urged to remonstrate,
      she said, &ldquo;I could not&mdash;I would not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was gently and touchingly considerate towards the lovers, silently but
      unobtrusively obviating all that could jar on their feelings, and
      employing her exquisite tact in the kindest manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      She released Meta from the expedition to Ryde, silencing scruples on the
      one hand, by a suggestion of &ldquo;poor Sir Henry,&rdquo; and, on the other, by
      offering to exchange her for Mary. The first proposal made Mary take such
      a spring in her chair, with eyes so round, and cheeks so red, and such a
      shriek about Harry and the Bucephalus, that no one could have borne to say
      one word in opposition, even if it had not been the opinion of the Council
      that sea air would best repair Mary&rsquo;s strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel had some private fears of a scene, since it was one of Miss Bracy&rsquo;s
      idiosyncrasies to be hurt whenever Mary was taken out of her hands; and
      she went to announce the design, in dread lest this shock should destroy
      the harmony that had prevailed for many months; nay, she almost believed,
      since the loss of the Alcestis had been known.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was agreeably surprised. Miss Bracy thought Mary in need of the
      change, and discussed both her and Blanche in so pleasant and sensible a
      manner, that Ethel was quite relieved. She partook in Mary&rsquo;s anticipations
      of pleasure, forwarded her preparations, and was delighted with her
      promise of letters&mdash;promises that Mary bestowed so largely, in the
      fullness of her heart, that there were fears lest her whole time should be
      spent in writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her soft heart indulged in a shower of tears when she wished them all
      good-bye; and Ethel and Blanche found the house was very empty without
      her; but that was only till Meta came in from a walk with Norman, and,
      under the plea of trying to supply Mary&rsquo;s place, did the work of five
      Maries, and a great deal besides.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing could be happier than Meta&rsquo;s visit, brightening the house so that
      the Mays thought they had never known half her charms, helping whatever
      was going on, yet ready to play with Daisy, tell stories to Aubrey, hear
      Tom&rsquo;s confidences, talk to Margaret, read with Norman, and teach Richard
      singing for his school children. The only vexation was, that every one
      could not always engross her entirely; and Dr. May used to threaten that
      they should never spare her to that long-legged fellow, Norman.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had persuaded Bellairs to go and take care of Flora and Mary, instead
      of the French maid&mdash;a plan which greatly satisfied Margaret, who had
      never liked the looks of Coralie, and which Meta held to be a grand
      emancipation. She persuaded old nurse to teach her to be useful, and
      Margaret used to declare that she witnessed scenes as good as a play in
      her room, where the little dexterous scholar, apparently in jest, but
      really in sober, earnest, wiled instruction from the old woman; and made
      her experiments, between smiles and blushes, and merrily glorying in
      results that promised that she would be a notable housewife. Whether it
      were novelty or not, she certainly had an aptitude and delight in domestic
      details, such as Ethel never could attain; and, as Dr. May said, the one
      performed by a little finger what the other laboured at with a great mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the schoolroom, Meta was as highly appreciated. She found an hour for
      helping Blanche in her music, and for giving, what was still more useful,
      an interest and spirit to studies, where, it must be owned, poor good Mary
      had been a dead weight. She enlivened Miss Bracy so much, and so often
      contrived a walk or a talk with her, that the saucy Blanche told Hector
      that she thought Ethel would be quite second-fiddle with Miss Bracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      No such thing. Miss Bracy&rsquo;s great delight was in having a listener for her
      enthusiasm about Miss Ethel. She had been lately having a correspondence
      with a former school-fellow, who was governess in a family less
      considerate than the Mays, and who poured out, in her letters, feelings
      much like those with which Miss Bracy had begun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing could be more salutary than to find herself repeating all Ethel&rsquo;s
      pieces of advice; and, one day, when her friend had been more distressed
      than usual, she called Ethel herself, to consult on her answer, owning how
      much she was reminded of herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;I am afraid it would only tease you to hear how much
      I am indebted to your decision and kindness&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said Ethel, laughing her awkward laugh. &ldquo;You have often had to
      forget my savage ways.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray don&rsquo;t say that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Ethel, breaking in, &ldquo;the philosophy is this: I believe
      that it is a trying life. I know teaching takes a great deal out of one;
      and loneliness may cause tendencies to dwell on fancied slights in
      trifles, that might otherwise be hurried over. But I think the thing is,
      to pass them over, and make a conscience of turning one&rsquo;s mind to
      something fresh&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you made me do, when you brought me amusing books, and taught me
      botany&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, still more, when you took to working for the infant school. Yes, I
      think the way to be happy and useful is to get up many interests, so as to
      be fresh and vigorous, and think not at all of personalities. There&rsquo;s a
      truism!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very true, though,&rdquo; said Miss Bracy. &ldquo;Indeed, all your kindness and
      consideration would never have done me half the good they have, dear Miss
      Ethel, if you had not taught me that referring all to one&rsquo;s own feelings
      and self is the way to be unhappy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;It is the surest way for any one to be miserable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I could only persuade poor dear Ellen to think that even if a slight
      were real, it ought to be borne forgivingly, and not brooded over. Ah! you
      are laughing; perhaps you have said the same about me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would forgive it now, I think,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never thought I did not forgive. I did not see that brooding over
      vexations was not pardoning them. I have told her so now; and, oh! if she
      could but have seen how true sorrows are borne here, she would be cured,
      like me, of making imaginary ones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None could help being better for living with papa,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel made Miss Bracy happy by a kiss before she left her. It was a
      cheering belief that, whatever the future trials of her life might be, the
      gentle little lady would meet them with a healthier mind, more vigorous in
      overlooking troubles and without punctilious sensitiveness on the lookout
      for affronts. &ldquo;Believing all things, bearing all things, hoping all
      things, enduring all things,&rdquo; would be to her the true secret of serenity
      of spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel might not have been blameless or consistent in her dealings in this
      difficult intercourse, but her kind heart, upright intention, and force of
      character, had influence far beyond her own perception. Indeed, she knew
      not that she had personal influence at all, but went on in her own
      straightforward humility.

      CHAPTER XXIV.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Enough of foresight sad, too much
      Of retrospect have I;
     And well for me, that I, sometimes,
      Can put those feelings by.

     There speaks the man we knew of yore,
      Well pleased, I hear them say;
     Such was he, in his lighter moods,
      Before our heads were gray.

     Buoyant he was in spirit, quick
      Of fancy, light of heart;
     And care, and time, and change have left
      Untouch&rsquo;d his better part.&rdquo;&mdash;SOUTHEY.
</pre>
    <p>
      Etheldred May and Meta Rivers were together in the drawing-room. The
      timepiece pointed towards ten o&rsquo;clock, but the tea-things were on the
      table, prepared for a meal, the lamp shone with a sort of consciousness,
      and Ethel moved restlessly about, sometimes settling her tea equipage,
      sometimes putting away a stray book, or resorting by turns to her book, or
      to work a red and gold scroll on coarse canvas, on the other end of which
      Meta was employed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nervous, Ethel?&rdquo; said Meta, looking up with a merry provoking smile,
      knowing how much the word would displease.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is for you,&rdquo; retorted Ethel, preferring to carry the war into the
      enemy&rsquo;s quarters. &ldquo;What, don&rsquo;t you know that prudent people say that your
      fate depends on her report?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least,&rdquo; said Meta, laughing; &ldquo;she is a living instance that every one
      is not eaten up, and we shall see if she fulfils Tom&rsquo;s prediction of being
      tattooed, or of having a slice out of the fattest part of her cheek.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know very well,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;the worst she said it would be, the more
      you would go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not quite that,&rdquo; said Meta, blushing, and looking down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, don&rsquo;t be deceitful!&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;You know very well that you are
      still more bent on it than you were last year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure I am!&rdquo; said Meta, looking up with a sudden beamy flash of her
      dark eyes. &ldquo;Norman and I know each other so much better now,&rdquo; she added,
      rather falteringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay! I know you are ready to go through thick and thin, and that is why I
      give my consent and approbation. You are not to be stopped for nonsense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for nonsense, certainly,&rdquo; said Meta, &ldquo;but&rdquo;&mdash;and her voice became
      tremulous&mdash;&ldquo;if Dr. May deliberately said it would be wrong, and that
      I should be an encumbrance and perplexity, I am making up my mind to the
      chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what would you do?&rdquo; asked Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. You should not ask such questions, Ethel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! it won&rsquo;t happen, so it is no use to talk about it,&rdquo; said Ethel.
      &ldquo;Fancy my having made you cry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very silly of me,&rdquo; said Meta, brightening and laughing, but sighing. &ldquo;I
      am only afraid Mrs. Arnott may think me individually unfit for the kind of
      life, as if I could not do what other women can. Do I look so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look as if you were meant to be put under a glass case!&rdquo; said Ethel,
      surveying the little elegant figure, whose great characteristic was a look
      of exquisite finish, not only in the features and colouring, the turn of
      the head, and the shape of the small rosy-tipped fingers, but in
      everything she wore, from the braids of black silk hair, to the little
      shoe on her foot, and even in the very lightness and gaiety of her
      movements.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Ethel!&rdquo; cried Meta, springing up in dismay, and looking at herself in
      the glass. &ldquo;What is the matter with me? Do tell me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never get rid of it,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;unless you get yourself
      tattooed! Even separation from Bellairs hasn&rsquo;t answered. And, after all, I
      don&rsquo;t think it would be any satisfaction to Norman or papa. I assure you,
      Meta, whatever you may think of it, it is not so much bother to be
      prettier than needful, as it is to be uglier than needful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is needful?&rdquo; said Meta, much amused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose to be like Mary, so that nobody should take notice of one, but
      that one&rsquo;s own people may have the satisfaction of saying, &lsquo;she is
      pleasing,&rsquo; or &lsquo;she is in good looks.&rsquo; I think Gertrude will come to that.
      That&rsquo;s one comfort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is your own case, Ethel. I have heard those very things said of
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of my hatchet face!&rdquo; said Ethel contemptuously. &ldquo;Some one must have been
      desperately bent on flattering the Member&rsquo;s family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could repeat more,&rdquo; said Meta, &ldquo;if I were to go back to the
      Commemoration, and to the day you went home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel crimsoned, and made a sign with her hand, exclaiming, &ldquo;Hark!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It went past.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the omnibus. She must be walking down!&rdquo; Ethel breathed short, and
      wandered aimlessly about; Meta put her arm round her waist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not think this would be so much to you,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Meta, it seems like dear mamma coming to see how we have been going
      on. And then papa! I wish I had gone up to the station with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has Richard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, but I am afraid Margaret is listening and will be restless, and have
      a palpitation; and I can&rsquo;t go and see, or I shall disturb her. Oh, I wish
      it were over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meta stroked her, and soothed her, and assured her that all would do well,
      and presently they heard the click of the door. Ethel flew into the hall,
      where she stopped short, her heart beating high at the sound of
      overpoweringly familiar accents.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was almost relieved by detecting otherwise little resemblance; the
      height was nearly the same, but there was not the plump softness of
      outline. Mrs. Arnott was small, thin, brisk and active, with a vivacious
      countenance, once evidently very fair and pretty, but aged and worn by
      toil, not trouble, for the furrows were the traces of smiles around her
      merry mouth, and beautiful blue eyes, that had a tendency lo laugh and cry
      both at once. Dr. May who had led her into the light, seemed to be looking
      her all over, while Richard was taking the wraps from her, and Ethel tried
      to encourage herself to go forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay!&rdquo; said the doctor, kissing her. &ldquo;I see you, Flora, now. I have found
      you again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I found you as soon as I heard your voice, Richard,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;And now
      for the bairnies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is one, but there is but a poor show forthcoming to-night. Do you
      know her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was an unspeakable joy in being pressed in Aunt Flora&rsquo;s arms, like a
      returning beam from the sunshine of seven years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This must be Ethel! My dear, how you tower above me&mdash;you that I left
      in arms! And,&rdquo; as she advanced into the drawing-room&mdash;&ldquo;why, surely
      this is not Margaret!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Margaret&mdash;not the Margaret. I wish I were,&rdquo; said Meta, as Mrs.
      Arnott stood with an arm on her shoulder, in the midst of an embrace, Dr.
      May enjoying her perplexity and Meta&rsquo;s blushes. &ldquo;See, Flora, these black
      locks never belonged to Calton Hill daisies, yet a daisy of my own she is.
      Can&rsquo;t you guess?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Rivers!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Arnott; and though she kissed her cordially,
      Meta suspected a little doubt and disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Dr. May. &ldquo;We change Mary for this little woman as Flora&rsquo;s
      lady-in-waiting, when she and her husband go out yachting and shooting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flora and her husband! There&rsquo;s a marvellous sound! Where are they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are staying at Eccleswood Castle,&rdquo; said Ethel; &ldquo;and Mary with them.
      They would have been at home to receive you, but your note yesterday took
      us all by surprise. Norman is away too, at a college meeting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Margaret&mdash;my Margaret! Does not she come downstairs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! poor dear,&rdquo; said Dr. May, &ldquo;she has not been in this room since that
      sultry day in July.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The eighteenth,&rdquo; said Richard; the precision of the date marking but too
      well the consciousness that it was an epoch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can keep her quieter upstairs,&rdquo; said Dr. May; &ldquo;but you must not see
      her to-night. She will enjoy you very much to-morrow; but excitement at
      night always does her harm, so we put her to bed, and told her to think
      about no one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Arnott looked at him as if longing, but dreading, to ask further, and
      allowed her nephew and niece to seat her at the table, and attend to her
      wants, before she spoke again. &ldquo;Then the babies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t keep babies, Gertrude would tell you,&rdquo; said Dr. May. &ldquo;There are
      three great creatures, whom Ethel barbarously ordered off to bed. Ethel is
      master here, you must know, Flora&mdash;we all mind what she says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, papa,&rdquo; pleaded Ethel, distressed, &ldquo;you know it was because I thought
      numbers might be oppressive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never dispute,&rdquo; said Dr. May. &ldquo;We bow to a beneficial despotism, and
      never rebel, do we, Meta?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seeing that Ethel took the imputation to heart, Meta rejoined, &ldquo;You are
      making Mrs. Arnott think her the strong-minded woman of the family, who
      winds up the clock and cuts the bread.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; that she makes you do, when the boys are away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t be vituperated about hunches of bread. I
      have quite enough to bear on the score of tea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your tea is very good,&rdquo; said Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See how they propitiate her,&rdquo; maliciously observed the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all; it is Richard standing up for his pupil,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;It is
      all very well now, with people who know the capacities of mortal tea; but
      the boys expect it to last from seven o&rsquo;clock to ten, through an unlimited
      number of cups, till I have announced that a teapot must be carved on my
      tombstone, with an epitaph, &lsquo;Died of unreasonable requirements.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Arnott looked from one to the other, amused, observant, and
      perceiving that they were all under that form of shyness which brings up
      family wit to hide embarrassment or emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Harry one of these unreasonable boys?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;My dear Harry&mdash;I
      presume Ethel has not sent him to bed. Is there any hope of my seeing
      him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great hope,&rdquo; said Dr. May. &ldquo;He has been in the Baltic fleet, a pretty
      little summer trip, from which we expect him to return any day. My old
      Lion! I am glad you had him for a little while, Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear fellow! his only fault was being homesick, and making me catch the
      infection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad you did not put off your coming,&rdquo; said Dr. May gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are in time for the consecration,&rdquo; said Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Cocksmoor! When will it take place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On St. Andrew&rsquo;s Day. It is St. Andrew&rsquo;s Church, and the bishop fixed the
      day, otherwise it is a disappointment that Hector cannot be present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hector?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hector Ernescliffe&mdash;poor Alan&rsquo;s brother, whom we don&rsquo;t well know
      from ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you are curate, Ritchie?&rdquo; said his aunt&mdash;&ldquo;if I may still call
      you so. You are not a bit altered from the mouse you used to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Church mouse to Cocksmoor,&rdquo; said Dr. May, &ldquo;nearly as poor. We are to
      invest his patrimony in a parsonage as soon as our architect in ordinary
      can find time for it. Spencer&mdash;you remember him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember how you and he used to be inseparable! And he has settled
      down, at last, by your side?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The two old doctors hope to bolster each other up till Mr. Tom comes down
      with modern science in full force. That boy will do great things&mdash;he
      has as clear a head as I ever knew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And more&mdash;&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, as sound a heart. I must find you his tutor&rsquo;s letter, Flora. They
      have had a row in his tutor&rsquo;s house at Eton, and our boys made a gallant
      stand for the right, Tom especially, guarding the little fellows in a way
      that does one good to hear of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I must express my strong sense of gratitude for his truth, uprightness,
      and moral courage,&rsquo;&rdquo; quoted Meta.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, ha! you have learned it by heart! I know you copied it out for
      Norman, who has the best right to rejoice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a set of children to be proud of, Richard!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs.
      Arnott.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be surprised at&mdash;to be thankful for,&rdquo; said Dr. May, almost
      inarticulately.
    </p>
    <p>
      To see her father so happy with Mrs. Arnott necessarily drew Ethel&rsquo;s heart
      towards her; and, when they had bidden him goodnight, the aunt instantly
      assumed a caressing confidence towards Ethel, particularly comfortable to
      one consciously backward and awkward, and making her feel as intimate as
      if the whole space of her rational life had not elapsed since their last
      meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must you go, my dear?&rdquo; said her aunt, detaining her over her fire. &ldquo;I
      can&rsquo;t tell how to spare you. I want to hear of your dear father. He looks
      aged and thin, Ethel, and yet that sweet expression is the same as ever.
      Is he very anxious about poor Margaret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exactly anxious,&rdquo; said Ethel mournfully&mdash;&ldquo;there is not much room
      for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Ethel&mdash;you don&rsquo;t mean?&mdash;I thought&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose we ought to have written more fully,&rdquo; said Ethel; &ldquo;but it has
      been very gradual, and we never say it to ourselves. She is as bright, and
      happy, and comfortable as ever, in general, and, perhaps, may be so for a
      long time yet, but each attack weakens her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of attack?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faintness-sinking. It is suspended action of the heart. The injury to the
      spine deranged the system, and then the long suspense, and the shock&mdash;It
      is not one thing more than another, but it must go on. Dr. Spencer will
      tell you. You won&rsquo;t ask papa too much about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed. And he bears it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He bears everything. Strength comes up out of his great lovingness. But,
      oh! I sometimes long that he may never have any more sorrows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor child!&rdquo; said Mrs. Arnott, putting her arm round her niece&rsquo;s
      waist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel rested her head on her shoulder. &ldquo;Aunt Flora! Aunt Flora! If any
      words could tell what Margaret has been ever since we were left. Oh, don&rsquo;t
      make me talk or think of ourselves without her. It is wrong to wish. And
      when you see her, that dear face of hers will make you happy in the
      present. Then,&rdquo; added Ethel, not able to leave off with such a subject,
      &ldquo;you have our Norman to see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Norman&rsquo;s project is too delightful to us; but I fear what it may be
      to your father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He gives dear Norman, as his most precious gift, the flower and pride of
      us all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Ethel, I am quite frightened at Miss Rivers&rsquo;s looks. Is it possible
      that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Flora,&rdquo; broke in Ethel, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t say a word against it. The choicest
      goods wear the best; and whatever woman can do, Meta Rivers can. Norman is
      a great tall fellow, as clever as possible, but perfectly feckless. If you
      had him there alone, he would be a bee without a queen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; continued Ethel. &ldquo;Meta is a concentration of spirit and energy,
      delights in practical matters, is twice the housewife I am, and does all
      like an accomplishment. Between them, they will make a noble missionary&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she looks&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush,&rdquo; continued the niece. &ldquo;You will think me domineering; but please
      don&rsquo;t give any judgment without seeing; for they look to you as an
      arbitrator, and casual words will weigh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Ethel; perhaps you are right. When does he think of coming
      out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When he is ordained&mdash;some time next year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does she live with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose she lives with Flora; but we always manage to get her when
      Norman is at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have told me nothing of Flora or Mary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have little real to tell. Good old Mary! I dare say Harry talked to you
      plentifully of her. She is a&mdash;a nice old darling,&rdquo; said Ethel fondly.
      &ldquo;We want her again very much, and did not quite bargain for the succession
      of smart visits that she has been paying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With Flora?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Unluckily George Rivers has taken an aversion to the Grange, and I
      have not seen Flora this whole year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel stopped short, and said that she must not keep Margaret expecting
      her. Perhaps her aunt guessed that she had touched the true chord of
      anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning brought a cheering account of Margaret; and Mrs. Arnott was to
      see her directly after breakfast. In the meantime, the firm limbs, blue
      eyes, and rosy face of Gertrude seemed a fair representation of the little
      bride&rsquo;s-maid, whom she remembered.
    </p>
    <p>
      A very different niece did she find upstairs, though the smiling,
      overflowing eyes, and the fond, eager look of recognition, as if asking to
      be taken to her bosom, had in them all the familiarity of old tenderness.
      &ldquo;Auntie! dear auntie! that you should have come back to me again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Arnott fondly caressed her, but could not speak at first, for even
      her conversation with Ethel had not prepared her for so wasted and broken
      an appearance. Dr. May spoke briskly of Margaret&rsquo;s having behaved very
      well and slept like a good child, told Margaret where he had to go that
      morning, and pointed out to Mrs. Arnott some relics of herself still
      remaining; but the nervous tremulousness of manner did not much comfort
      her, although Margaret answered cheerfully. Nothing was so effectual in
      composing the aunt as Aubrey&rsquo;s coming headlong in to announce the gig, and
      to explain to Margaret his last design for a cathedral&mdash;drawing plans
      being just now his favourite sport.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Architecture is all our rage at present,&rdquo; said Margaret, as her father
      hurried away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so glad to have come in time for the consecration!&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Arnott, following her niece&rsquo;s lead. &ldquo;Is that a model of the church?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; cried Margaret, lighting up. &ldquo;Richard made it for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I show it to Aunt Flora?&rdquo; said Aubrey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring it here, if you can lift it,&rdquo; said Margaret; and, Aunt Flora
      helping, the great cumbersome thing was placed beside her, whilst she
      smiled and welcomed it like a child, and began an eager exhibition. Was it
      not a beautiful little pierced spire?&mdash;that was an extravagance of
      Dr. Spencer&rsquo;s own. Papa said he could not ask Captain Gordon to sanction
      it&mdash;the model did it no justice, but it was so very beautiful in the
      rich creamy stone rising up on the moor, and the blue sky looking through,
      and it caught the sunset lights so beautifully. So animated was her
      description, that Mrs. Arnott could not help asking, &ldquo;Why, my dear, when
      have you seen it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never,&rdquo; said Margaret, with her sweet smile. &ldquo;I have never seen
      Cocksmoor; but Dr. Spencer and Meta are always sketching it for me, and
      Ethel would not let an effect pass without telling me. I shall hear how it
      strikes you next.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope to see it by and by. What a comfortable deep porch! If we could
      build such churches in the colonies, Margaret!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See what little Meta will do for you! Yes, we had the porch deep for a
      shelter&mdash;that is copied from the west door of the minster, and is it
      not a fine high-pitched roof? John Taylor, who is to be clerk, could not
      understand its being open; he said, when he saw the timbers, that a man
      and his family might live up among them. They are noble oak beams; we
      would not have any sham&mdash;here, Aubrey, take off the roof, and auntie
      will see the shape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like the ribs of a ship,&rdquo; explained Aubrey, unconscious that the meaning
      was deeper than his sister could express, and he continued: &ldquo;Such fine oak
      beams! I rode with Dr. Spencer one day last year to choose them. It is a
      two-aisled church, you see, that a third may be added.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel came up as Aubrey began to absorb the conversation. &ldquo;Lessons,
      Aubrey,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;So, Margaret, you are over your dear model?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not forestalling you too much I hope, Ethel dear,&rdquo; said Margaret; &ldquo;as you
      will show her the church itself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have the best right,&rdquo; said Ethel; &ldquo;but come, Aubrey, we must not
      dawdle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will show you the stones I laid myself, Aunt Flora,&rdquo; said Aubrey,
      running off without much reluctance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ethel has him in excellent order,&rdquo; said Mrs. Arnott.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That she has; she brings him on beautifully, and makes him enjoy it. She
      teaches him arithmetic in some wonderful scientific way that nobody can
      understand but Norman, and he not the details; but he says it is all
      coming right, and will make him a capital mathematical scholar, though he
      cannot add up pounds, shillings, and pence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expected to be struck with Ethel,&rdquo; said Mrs. Arnott; &ldquo;and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Margaret, waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she does exceed my expectations. There is something curiously
      winning in that quaint, quick, decisive manner of hers. There is so much
      soul in the least thing she does, as if she could not be indifferent for a
      moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly&mdash;exactly so,&rdquo; said Margaret, delighted. &ldquo;It is really doing
      everything with all her might. Little, simple, everyday matters did not
      come naturally to her as to other people, and the having had to make them
      duties has taught her to do them with that earnest manner, as if there
      were a right and a wrong to her in each little mechanical household
      office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harry described her to me thus,&rdquo; said Mrs. Arnott, smiling: &ldquo;&lsquo;As to
      Ethel, she is an odd fish; but Cocksmoor will make a woman of her after
      all.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite true!&rdquo; cried Margaret. &ldquo;I should not have thought Harry had so much
      discernment in those days. Cocksmoor gave the stimulus, and made Ethel
      what she is. Look there&mdash;over the mantelpiece, are the designs for
      the painted glass, all gifts, except the east window. That one of St.
      Andrew introducing the lad with the loaves and fishes is Ethel&rsquo;s window.
      It is the produce of the hoard she began this time seven years, when she
      had but one sovereign in the world. She kept steadily on with it, spending
      nothing on herself that she could avoid, always intending it for the
      church, and it was just enough to pay for this window.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most suitable,&rdquo; said Mrs. Arnott.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; Mr. Wilmot and I persuaded her into it; but I do not think she would
      have allowed it, if she had seen the application we made of it&mdash;the
      gift of her girlhood blessed and extended. Dear King Etheldred, it is the
      only time I ever cheated her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a beautiful east window. And this little one&mdash;St. Margaret I
      see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! papa would not be denied choosing that for his subject. We reproached
      him with legendary saints, and overwhelmed him with antiquarianism, to
      show that the Margaret of the dragon was not the Margaret of the daisy;
      but he would have it; and said we might thank him for not setting his
      heart on St. Etheldreda.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is mine,&rdquo; said Margaret, very low; and her aunt abstained from
      remark, though unable to look, without tears, at the ship of the Apostles,
      the calming of the storm, and the scroll, with the verse:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
         He bringeth them unto the haven where they would be.
</pre>
    <p>
      Beneath were the initials, &ldquo;A. H. E.,&rdquo; and the date of the year, the only
      memorials of the founder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret next drew attention to St. Andrew with his cross&mdash;Meta&rsquo;s
      gift. &ldquo;And, besides,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;George Rivers made us a beautiful
      present, which Meta hunted up. Old Mr. Rivers, knowing no better, once
      bought all the beautiful carved fittings of a chapel in France, meaning to
      fit up a library with them; but, happily, he never did, and a happy notion
      came into Meta&rsquo;s head, so she found them out, and Dr. Spencer has adapted
      them, and set them all to rights; and they are most exquisite. You never
      saw such foliage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus Margaret proceeded with the description of everything in the church,
      and all the little adventures of the building, as if she could not turn
      away from the subject; and her aunt listened and wondered, and, when
      called away, that Margaret might rest before nurse came to dress her, she
      expressed her wonder to Meta.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was the answer; &ldquo;it is her chief occupation and interest. I do not
      mean that she has not always her own dear full sympathy for every one&rsquo;s
      concerns, but Cocksmoor is her concern, almost more than even Ethel&rsquo;s. I
      think she could chronicle every stage in the building better than Dr.
      Spencer himself, and it is her daily delight to hear his histories of his
      progress. And not only with the church but the people; she knows all about
      every family; Richard and Ethel tell her all their news; she talks over
      the school with the mistress every Sunday, and you cannot think what a
      feeling there is for her at Cocksmoor. A kind message from Miss May has an
      effect that the active workers cannot always produce.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Arnott saw that Meta was right, when, in the afternoon, she walked
      with her nieces to see Cocksmoor. It was not a desolate sight as in old
      times, for the fair edifice, rising on the slope, gave an air of
      protection to the cottages, which seemed now to have a centre of unity,
      instead of lying forlorn and scattered. Nor were they as wretched in
      themselves, for the impulse of civilisation had caused windows to be
      mended and railings to be tidied, and Richard promoted, to the utmost,
      cottage gardening, so that, though there was an air of poverty, there was
      no longer an appearance of reckless destitution and hopeless neglect.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the cottages, Mrs. Taylor had not entirely ceased to speak with a
      piteous voice, even though she told of the well-doing of her girls at
      service; but Granny Hall&rsquo;s merry content had in it something now of
      principle, and Sam had married a young Fordholm wife, who promised to be a
      pattern for Cocksmoor. Every one asked after Miss May, with a tenderness
      and affection that Mrs. Arnott well appreciated; and when they went into
      the large fresh school, where Richard was hearing a class, Cherry Elwood
      looked quite cheered and enlivened by hearing that she had been able to
      enjoy seeing her aunt. Mrs. Arnott was set to enlighten the children about
      the little brown girls whom she was wont to teach, and came away with a
      more brilliant impression of their intelligence than she might have had,
      if she had not come to them fresh from the Antipodes.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had to tell Margaret all her impressions on her return, and very
      pretty smiles repaid her commendations. She understood better the constant
      dwelling on the subject, as she perceived how little capable Margaret was
      of any employment. The book, the writing materials, and work-basket were
      indeed placed by her side, but very seldom did the feeble fingers engage
      in any of the occupations once so familiar&mdash;now and then a pencilled
      note would be sent to Flora, or to Hector Ernescliffe, or a few stitches
      be set in her work, or a page or two turned of a book, but she was far
      more often perfectly still, living, assuredly in no ordinary sphere of
      human life, but never otherwise than cheerful, and open to the various
      tidings and interests which, as Ethel had formerly said, shifted before
      her like scenes in a magic lantern, and, perhaps, with less of substance
      than in those earlier days, when her work among them was not yet done, and
      she was not, as it were, set aside from them. They were now little more
      than shadows reflected from the world whence she was passing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet her home was not sad. When Dr. Spencer came in the evening, and old
      Edinburgh stories were discussed, Dr. May talked with spirit, and laughed
      with the merry note that Mrs. Amott so well remembered, and Meta Rivers
      chimed in with her gay, saucy repartees, nor, though Richard was always
      silent, and Ethel&rsquo;s brow seemed to bear a weight of thought, did it seem
      as if their spirits were depressed; while there was certainly no restraint
      on the glee of Blanche, Aubrey, and Gertrude, who were running into
      Margaret&rsquo;s room, and making as much noise there as they chose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Arnott was at home with the whole family from the first, and in every
      one&rsquo;s confidence; but what she enjoyed above all was, the sitting in
      Margaret&rsquo;s room in the morning, when there was no danger of interruption,
      the three children being all safe captives to their lessons, and Meta, in
      Richard&rsquo;s workshop, illuminating texts on zinc scrolls for the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret came out more in these interviews. It had been a kind of shyness
      that made her talk so exclusively of the church at the first meeting; she
      had now felt her way, and knew again&mdash;and realised&mdash;the same
      kind aunt with whom she had parted in her childhood, and now far dearer,
      since she herself was better able to appreciate her, and with a certain
      resemblance to her mother, that was unspeakably precious and soothing to
      one deprived, as Margaret had been, at the commencement of her illness and
      anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could hardly see her aunt come near her, without thanking her for
      having come home, and saying how every time she awoke it was with the
      sense that something was comfortable, then remembering it was Aunt Flora&rsquo;s
      being in the house. She seemed to have a feeling, as if telling everything
      to her aunt were like rendering up her account to her mother, and, at
      different times, she related the whole, looking back on the various
      decisions she had had to make or to influence, and reviewing her own
      judgments, though often with self-blame, not with acuteness of distress,
      but rather with a humble trust in the Infinite Mercy that would atone for
      all shortcomings and infirmities, truly sorrowed for.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the whole it was a peaceful and grateful retrospect; the brothers all
      doing so well in their several ways, and such a comfort to their father.
      Tom, concerning whom she had made the greatest mistake, might be looked
      upon as rescued by Norman. Aubrey, Margaret said, smiling, was Ethel&rsquo;s
      child, and had long been off her mind; Hector, to her quite a brother,
      would miss her almost more than her own brothers, but good honest fellow,
      he had a home here; and, whispered Margaret, smiling and glowing a little,
      &ldquo;don&rsquo;t tell any one, for it is a secret of secrets. Hector told me one
      evening that, if he could be very steady, he hoped he might yet have
      Blanche at Maplewood. Poor little White Mayflower, it won&rsquo;t be for want of
      liking on her part, and she so blushes and watches when Hector comes near,
      that I sometimes think that he might have said something like it to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Arnott gave no opinion on the plan for Norman and Meta; but Margaret,
      however, took all for granted, and expressed warm hopes for their sakes,
      that they would go out with Mrs. Arnott; then, when the suggestion seemed
      to astonish her aunt, who thought they were waiting for his ordination,
      she said, &ldquo;The fact is, that he would like to be ordained where he is to
      work; but I believe they do not like to say anything about the wedding
      because of me. Now, of all persons, I must chiefly rejoice in what may
      help to teach in those islands. I cannot bear to be a hindrance. Whatever
      happens, Aunt Flora, will you take care that they know this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As to her father, Margaret was at rest. He had much more calmness than
      when he was more new to grief, and could bear far more patiently and
      hopefully than at first. He lived more on his affections above, and much
      as he loved those below, he did not rest in them as once, and could better
      afford to have been removed. &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; said Margaret serenely, &ldquo;it has
      been good for him to have been gradually weaned from depending on me, so
      that it is Ethel who is really necessary to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For herself, Margaret was perfectly content and happy. She knew the
      temptation of her character had been to be the ruler and manager of
      everything, and she saw it had been well for her to have been thus
      assigned the part of Mary rather than of Martha. She remembered with
      thankful joy the engagement with Alan Ernescliffe, and though she still
      wore tokens of mourning for him, it was with a kind of pleasure in them.
      There had been so little promise of happiness from the first, that there
      was far more peace in thinking of him as sinking into rest in Harry&rsquo;s
      arms, than as returning to grieve over her decline; and that last gift of
      his, the church, had afforded her continual delight, and above all other
      earthly pursuits, smoothed away the languor and weariness of disease, as
      she slowly sank to join him. Now that her aunt had come to bring back a
      sunbeam of her childhood, Margaret declared that she had no more grief or
      care, except one, and that a very deep and sad one&mdash;namely poor
      Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Arnott had at first been inclined to fear that her goddaughter was
      neglecting her own family, since she had not been at home this whole year,
      but the slightest betrayal of this suspicion roused Margaret to an eager
      defence. She had not a doubt that Flora would gladly have been with her,
      but she believed that she was not acting by her own choice, or more truly,
      that her husband was so devoted to her, that she felt the more bound to
      follow his slightest wishes, however contrary to her own. The season had
      been spent in the same whirl that had, last year, been almost beyond human
      power, even when stimulated by enjoyment and success; and now, when her
      spirits were lowered, and her health weakened, Meta had watched and
      trembled for her, though never able to obtain an avowal that it was an
      overstrain, and while treated most affectionately, never admitted within
      her barrier of reserve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I could see poor Flora comforted, or if even she would only let me
      enter into her troubles,&rdquo; Margaret said, sighing, &ldquo;I should be content.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The consecration day came near, and the travellers began to return. Meta
      was in a state of restlessness, which in her was very pretty, under the
      disguise of a great desire to be useful. She fluttered about the house,
      visited Margaret, played with Gertrude, set the drawing-room ornaments to
      rights&mdash;a task which Ethel was very glad to depute to her, and made a
      great many expeditions into the garden to put together autumn nosegays for
      the vases&mdash;finally discovering that Ethel&rsquo;s potichomanie vases on the
      staircase window must have some red and brown leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not come back quite so soon with them, and Mrs. Arnott, slyly
      looking out of window, reported, &ldquo;Ha! he is come then! At least, I see the
      little thing has found&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something extremely unlike itself,&rdquo; said Dr. May, laughing. &ldquo;Something I
      could easily set down as a student at Edinburgh; thirty years ago. That&rsquo;s
      the very smile! I remember dear Maggie being more angry than I ever saw
      her before, because Mr. Fleet said that you smiled to show your white
      teeth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the best shadow of Maggie I ever saw,&rdquo; said Dr. May. &ldquo;She has
      taught the lad to smile. That is what I call a pretty sight!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Richard, it is a shame for old folks like us to stand spying them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They care very little for me,&rdquo; said Dr. May, &ldquo;but I shall have them in.
      Cold winds blowing about that little head! Ah! here they are. Fine leaves
      you gather, miss! Very red and brown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meta rather liked, than otherwise, those pretty teasings of Dr. May, but
      they always made Norman colour extremely, and he parried them by
      announcing news. &ldquo;No, not the Bucephalus, a marriage in high life, a
      relation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not poor Mary!&rdquo; cried Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary! what could make you think of her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a hen thinks of her ducklings when they go into waters beyond her
      ken,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;Well, as long as it is not Mary, I don&rsquo;t care!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;High life!&rdquo; repeated Meta. &ldquo;Oh, it can be only Agatha Langdale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s only Lord Cosham further to guess,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! why not young Ogilvie?&rdquo; said Dr. May. &ldquo;I am right, I see. Well, who
      is the lady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Miss Dunbar&mdash;a nice girl that I met at Glenbracken. Her property
      fits in with theirs, and I believe his father has been wishing it for a
      long time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does not sound too romantic,&rdquo; said Meta.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He writes as if he had the sense of having been extremely dutiful,&rdquo; said
      Norman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt thinking it needful in addressing a namesake, who has had an eye
      to the main chance,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t throw stones, young people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; exclaimed Meta; &ldquo;he did not look as if he would go and do such a
      stupid thing as that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably, it is anything but a stupid thing,&rdquo; said Dr. May.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are using him very ill among you,&rdquo; said Norman eagerly. &ldquo;I believe
      her to be excellent in every way; he has known her from childhood; he
      writes as if he were perfectly contented, and saw every chance of
      happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None the less for having followed his father&rsquo;s wishes&mdash;I am glad he
      did,&rdquo; said Ethel, coming to her brother&rsquo;s side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say you are right,&rdquo; was Meta&rsquo;s answer; &ldquo;but I am disappointed in
      him. He always promised to come and stay with you, and made such friends
      at Oxford, and he never came.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fancy there was a good deal to hinder him,&rdquo; said Norman; and, as Mrs.
      Arnott proceeded to inquiries after the Ogilvies in general, the master of
      Glenbracken was allowed to drop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meta, however, renewed the subject when walking to the minster that
      evening with Norman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may defend Mr. Ogilvie, Norman, but it is not what I should have
      expected from him. Why did he make promises, and then neglect his
      relations?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe that conscientiously he did not dare to come,&rdquo; said Norman. &ldquo;I
      know that he was greatly struck with Ethel at the time of the
      Commemoration, and therefore I could never again press him to come here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Norman, you hard-hearted monster! What a bad conductor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not wish to be a conductor,&rdquo; said Norman. &ldquo;If you had seen
      Glenbracken and the old people, you would perceive that it would not have
      been suitable on our part to promote anything of the kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would they have been so violent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not violent, but it would have been a severe struggle. They are good,
      kind people, but with strong prejudices; and, though I have no doubt they
      would have yielded to steady attachment on their son&rsquo;s part, and such
      conduct as Ethel&rsquo;s would have been, I could not lead in that direction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that pride, Norman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is doing by others as you were doing by yourself,&rdquo; half whispered
      Meta; &ldquo;but, after all, if he had no constancy, Ethel had an escape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was afraid that she had been rather touched, but I am glad to find
      myself mistaken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you thought so, how could you make such a public announcement?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed. &ldquo;I had made myself so nervous as to the effect, that, in
      desperation, I took her own way, and came out at once with it as
      unconsciously as I could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very naturally you acted unconsciousness! It was better than insulting
      her by seeming to condole. Not that I do, though, for she deserves more
      steadiness than he has shown! If a man could appreciate her at all, I
      should have thought that it would have been once and for ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember, he had barely known her a fortnight, and probably had no reason
      to believe that he had made any impression on her. He knew how such an
      attachment would grieve his parents, and, surely, he was acting dutifully,
      and with self-denial and consideration, in not putting himself in the way
      of being further attracted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Umph! You make a good defence, Norman, but I cannot forgive him for
      marrying somebody else, who cannot be Ethel&rsquo;s equal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is a good little girl; he will form her, and be very happy; perhaps
      more so than with a great soul and strong nature like Ethel&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only he is a canny Scot, and not a Dr. Spencer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too short acquaintance! besides, there were the parents. Moreover, what
      would become of home without Ethel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The unanswerable argument to make one contented,&rdquo; said Meta. &ldquo;And,
      certainly, to be wife to a Member of Parliament is not so very delightful
      that one would covet it for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any more than she does for herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norman was right in his view of his friend&rsquo;s motives, as well as of
      Ethel&rsquo;s present feelings. If there had ever been any disappointment about
      Norman Ogilvie, it had long since faded away. She had never given away the
      depths of her heart, though the upper surface had been stirred. All had
      long subsided, and she could think freely of him as an agreeable cousin,
      in whose brilliant public career she should always be interested, without
      either a wish to partake it, or a sense of injury or neglect. She had her
      vocation, in her father, Margaret, the children, home, and Cocksmoor; her
      mind and affections were occupied, and she never thought of wishing
      herself elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new church and the expected return of her sisters engrossed many more
      of her thoughts than did anything relating to Glenbracken.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not bear to talk of Flora, though almost as uneasy as was
      Margaret; and not able to lay aside misgivings, lest even her good simple
      Mary might have had her head turned by gaiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. and Mrs. Rivers arrived on the Saturday before the Tuesday fixed for
      the consecration, and stopped on their way, that they might see Margaret,
      deposit Mary, and resume Meta.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a short visit, and all that Ethel could discover was, that Flora
      was looking very ill, no longer able to conceal the worn and fagged
      expression of her countenance, and evidently dreadfully shocked by the
      sight of the havoc made by disease on Margaret&rsquo;s frame. Yet she talked
      with composure of indifferent subjects&mdash;the yacht, the visits, the
      Bucephalus, the church, and the arrangements for St. Andrew&rsquo;s Day. She
      owned herself overworked, and in need of rest, and, as she was not well
      enough to venture on being present at the consecration, she undertook to
      spend the day with Margaret, thus setting the others at liberty. This
      settled, she took her leave, for the journey had fatigued her greatly.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the short visit, Mary had moved and spoken so quietly, and looked
      so well-dressed and young-lady-like, that, in spite of her comfortable
      plump cheeks, Ethel felt quite afraid!
    </p>
    <p>
      But the instant the carriage had driven off, there was a skipping, a
      hugging, a screaming, &ldquo;Oh, it is so nice to be at home again!&rdquo;&mdash;and
      Ethel knew she had her own Mary. It was only a much better looking and
      more mannerly Mary, in the full bloom of seventeen, open and honest-faced,
      her profuse light hair prettily disposed, her hands and arms more
      civilised, and her powers of conversation and self-possession developed.
      Mary-like were her caresses of Gertrude, Mary-like her inquiries for
      Cocksmoor, Mary-like her insisting on bringing her boxes into Margaret&rsquo;s
      room, her exulting exhibition of all the pretty things that Flora and
      George had given to her, and the still more joyous bestowal of presents
      upon everybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her tastes were not a whit altered, nor her simplicity diminished. If she
      was pleased by joining a large dinner-party, her satisfaction was in the
      amusement of seeing well-dressed people, and a grand table; her knowledge
      of the world only reached to pronouncing everything unlike home, &ldquo;so
      funny;&rdquo; she had relished most freshly and innocently every pleasure that
      she could understand, she had learned every variety of fancy work to teach
      Blanche and Miss Bracy, had been the delight of every schoolroom and
      nursery, had struck up numberless eternal friendships, and correspondences
      with girls younger and shyer than herself, and her chief vexations seemed
      to have been first, that Flora insisted on her being called Miss May,
      secondly, that all her delights could not be shared by every one at home,
      and thirdly, that poor Flora could not bear to look at little children.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grievous complaints were preferred by the dwellers in the attics the next
      morning, that Mary and Blanche had talked to an unmentionable hour of the
      night; but, on the whole, Blanche was rather doubtful whether Mary had
      made the most of her opportunities of observation.

</pre>
    <p>
      The thirtieth of November dawned with the grave brightness of an autumn
      day, as the sun slowly mounted from the golden east, drinking up the mists
      that rose tardily, leaving the grass thickly bedewed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bells of Stoneborough Minster were ringing gladsome peals, and the
      sunshine had newly touched the lime trees, whose last bright yellow leaves
      were gently floating down, as the carriage, from the Grange, drew up at
      Dr. May&rsquo;s door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norman opened it, to claim Meta at once for the walk; Mrs. Arnott and Mary
      had gone on to assist Richard in his final arrangements, but even before
      Cocksmoor, with Ethel, was now the care of Margaret; and she had waited
      with her father to keep all bustle from her room, and to commit her into
      the charge of Flora and of nurse. Ethel seemed quite unwilling to go.
      There was that strange oppressed feeling on her as if the attainment of
      her wishes were joy too great to be real&mdash;as if she would fain hold
      off from it at the climax, and linger with the sister who had shared all
      with her, and to whom that church was even more than to herself. She came
      back, and back again, with fresh injunctions, sometimes forgetting the
      very purpose of her return, as if it had been only an excuse for looking
      at Margaret&rsquo;s countenance, and drinking in her sympathy from her face; but
      she was to go in George&rsquo;s carriage, and he was not a man to allow of
      loitering. He became so impatient of Ethel&rsquo;s delays, that she perceived
      that he could bear them no longer, gave her final kiss, and whispered, &ldquo;In
      spirit with us!&rdquo; then ran down and was seized on by George, who had
      already packed in the children and Miss Bracy, and was whirled away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flora dear,&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;do you dislike having the window opened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flora threw it up, protesting, in reply to her sister&rsquo;s scruples, that she
      liked the air. &ldquo;You always spoiled me,&rdquo; said Margaret fondly. &ldquo;Come and
      lie down by me. It is very nice to have you here,&rdquo; she added, as Flora
      complied; and she took her hand and fondled it, &ldquo;It is like the old times
      to have you here taking care of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very unlike them in some ways,&rdquo; said Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has been a great renewal of still older times,&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;to
      have Aunt Flora here. I hope you will get to know her, Flora, it is so
      like having mamma here,&rdquo; and she looked in her sister&rsquo;s face as she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora did not reply, but she lay quite still, as if there were a charm in
      the perfect rest of being alone with Margaret, making no effort, and being
      able to be silent. Time passed on, how long they knew not, but, suddenly,
      a thrill shot through Margaret&rsquo;s frame; she raised her hand and lifted her
      head, with an eager &ldquo;Hark!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flora could hear nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The bells&mdash;his bells!&rdquo; said Margaret, all one radiant look of
      listening, as Flora opened the window further, and the breeze wafted in
      the chime, softened by distance. The carnation tinted those thin white
      cheeks, eyes and smile beamed with joy, and uplifted finger and parted
      lips seemed marking every note of the cadence.
    </p>
    <p>
      It ceased. &ldquo;Alan! Alan!&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;It is enough! I am ready!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The somewhat alarmed look on Flora&rsquo;s face recalled her, and, smiling, she
      held out her hands for the consecration books, saying, &ldquo;Let us follow the
      service. It will be best for us both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Slowly, softly, and rather monotonously, Flora read on, till she had come
      more than half through the first lesson. Her voice grew husky, and she
      sometimes paused as if she could not easily proceed. Margaret begged her
      to stop, but she would not cease, and went on reading, though almost
      whispering, till she came to, &ldquo;If they return to Thee with all their heart
      and with all their soul in the land of their captivity, whither they have
      carried them captives, and pray toward their land, which Thou gavest unto
      their fathers, and toward the City which Thou hast chosen, and toward the
      House which I have built for Thy Name; then hearing from the Heavens, even
      from Thy dwelling-place&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flora could go no further; she strove, but one of her tearless sobs cut
      her short. She turned her face aside, and, as Margaret began to say
      something tender, she exclaimed, with low, hasty utterance, &ldquo;Margaret!
      Margaret! pray for me, for it is a hard captivity, and my heart is very,
      very sore. Oh! pray for me, that it may all be forgiven me&mdash;and that
      I may see my child again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Flora; my own poor, dear Flora! do I not pray? Oh! look up, look up.
      Think how He loves you. If I love you so much, how much more does not He?
      Come near me, Flora. Be patient, and I know peace will come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words had burst from Flora uncontrollably. She was aware, the next
      instant, that she had given way to harmful agitation, and, resuming her
      quiescence, partly by her own will, partly from the soothing effect of
      Margaret&rsquo;s words and tone, she allowed herself to be drawn close to her
      sister, and hid her face in the pillow, while Margaret&rsquo;s hands were folded
      over her, and words of blessing and prayer were whispered with a fervency
      that made them broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel, meanwhile, stood between Aubrey and Gertrude, hardly able to
      believe it was not a dream, as she beheld the procession enter the aisle,
      and heard the psalm that called on those doors to lift up their heads for
      Him who should enter. There was an almost bewildered feeling&mdash;could
      it indeed be true, as she followed the earlier part of the service, which
      set apart that building as a temple for ever, separate from all common
      uses. She had imagined the scene so often that she could almost have
      supposed the present, one of her many imaginations; but, by and by, the
      strangeness passed off, and she was able to enter into, not merely to
      follow, the prayers, and to feel the deep thanksgiving that such had been
      the crown of her feeble efforts. Margaret was in her mind the whole time,
      woven, as it were, into every supplication and every note of praise; and
      when there came the intercession for those in sickness and suffering,
      flowing into the commemoration of those departed in faith and fear,
      Ethel&rsquo;s spirit sank for a moment at the conviction that soon Margaret,
      like him, whom all must bear in mind on that day, might be included in
      that thanksgiving; yet, as the service proceeded, leaving more and more of
      earth behind, and the voices joined with angel and archangel, Ethel could
      lose the present grief, and only retain the certainty that, come what
      might, there was joy and union amid those who sung that hymn of praise.
      Never had Ethel been so happy&mdash;not in the sense of the finished work&mdash;no,
      she had lost all that, but in being more carried out of herself than ever
      she had been before, the free spirit of praise so bearing up her heart
      that the cry of glory came from her with such an exultant gladness, as
      might surely be reckoned as one of those foretastes of our everlasting
      life, not often vouchsafed even to the faithful, and usually sent to
      prepare strength for what may be in store.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blessing brought the sense of peace, which hung on her even while the
      sounds of movement began, and the congregation were emerging. As she came
      out, greetings, sentences of admiration of the church, and of inquiry for
      her absent sisters, were crowded upon her, as people moved towards the
      school, where a luncheon was provided for them, to pass away the interval
      until evening service. The half-dozen oldest Cocksmoorites were, meantime,
      to have a dinner in the former schoolroom, at the Elwoods&rsquo; house, and
      Ethel was anxious so see that all was right there; so, while the rest of
      her party were doing civil things, she gave her arm to Cherry, whose
      limping walk showed her to be very tired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Miss Ethel!&rdquo; said Cherry, &ldquo;if Miss May could only have been here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her heart is,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, ma&rsquo;am, I believe it is. You would not think, ma&rsquo;am, how all the
      children take heed to anything about her. If I only begin to say &lsquo;Miss May
      told me&mdash;&rsquo; they are all like mice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has done more for the real good of Cocksmoor than any one else,&rdquo; said
      Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      More might have been said, but they perceived that they were being
      overtaken by the body of clergy, who had been unrobing in the vestry.
      Ethel hastened to retreat within Mrs. Elwood&rsquo;s wicket gate, but she was
      arrested by Richard, and found herself being presented to the bishop, and
      the bishop shaking hands with her, and saying that he had much wished to
      be introduced to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, that was because she was her father&rsquo;s daughter, and by way of
      something to say. She mentioned what was going on at the cottage,
      whereupon the bishop wished to go in and see the old people; and,
      entering, they found the very comfortable-looking party just sitting down
      to roast-beef and goose. John Taylor, in a new black coat, on account of
      his clerkship, presiding at one end, and Mr. Elwood at the other, and Dame
      Hall finding conversation for the whole assembly; while Blanche, Aubrey,
      Gertrude, the little Larkinses, and the Abbotstoke Wilmots were ready to
      act as waiters with infinite delight. Not a bit daunted by the bishop, who
      was much entertained by her merry manner, old granny told him &ldquo;she had
      never seen nothing like it since the Jubilee, when the squire roasted an
      ox whole, and there wasn&rsquo;t none of it fit to eat; and when her poor father
      got his head broken. Well, to be sure, who would have thought what would
      come of Sam&rsquo;s bringing in the young gentleman and lady to see her the day
      her back was so bad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bishop said grace, and left granny to the goose, while he gave Ethel
      his arm, which she would have thought an unaccountable proceeding if she
      had not recollected that Richard might be considered as host, and that she
      was his eldest sister forthcoming.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner, however, had they come beyond the wicket than she saw her
      father speaking to Will Adams, and there was that in the air of both which
      made it no surprise when Dr. May came up, saying, &ldquo;Ethel, I must carry you
      away;&rdquo; and, in explanation to the bishop, &ldquo;my poor girl at home is not so
      well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All was inquiry and sympathy. Ethel was frantic to be at home, and would
      have rushed off at once, if Richard had not held her fast, asking what
      good she would do by hurrying in, breathless and exhausted, so as to add
      to Flora&rsquo;s fright and distress, the anxiety which was most upon their
      minds, since she had never before witnessed one of the seizures, that were
      only too ordinary matters in the eyes of the home party. No one but Dr.
      May and Ethel should go. Richard undertook to tell the rest, and the gig
      making its appearance, Ethel felt that the peculiarly kind manner with
      which the bishop pressed her hand, and gave them all good wishes, was like
      a continuation of his blessing to aid her in her home scene of trial.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps, it was well for her that her part in the consecration festivities
      should end here; at least so thought Mr. Wilmot, who, though very sorry
      for the cause, could not wish her to have been present at the luncheon.
      She had not thought of self hitherto, the church was the gift of Alan and
      Margaret, the work of preparing the people belonged to all alike, and she
      did not guess that, in the sight of others, she was not the nobody that
      she believed herself. Her share in the work at Cocksmoor was pretty well
      known, and Dr. Hoxton could not allow a public occasion to pass without
      speeches, such as must either have been very painful, or very hurtful to
      her. The absence of herself and her father, however, permitted a more free
      utterance to the general feeling; and things were said, that did indeed
      make the rest of the family extremely hot and uncomfortable, but which
      gave them extreme pleasure. Norman was obliged to spare Richard the
      answer, and said exactly what he ought, and so beautifully, that Meta
      could not find it in her heart to echo the fervent wish, which he
      whispered as he sat down, that speechifying could be abolished by Act of
      Parliament.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Arnott began to perceive that her nephew was something to be proud
      of, and to understand how much was sacrificed, while George Rivers
      expressed his opinion to her that Norman would be a crack speaker in the
      House, and he hoped she would say everything to hinder his going out, for
      it was a regular shame to waste him on the niggers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Owing to George having constituted himself her squire, Mrs. Arnott had not
      arrived at an understanding of the state of affairs at home; but, as soon
      as they rose up from luncheon, and she learned the truth from Richard and
      Mary, nothing would hinder her from walking home at once to see whether
      she could be useful. Mary was easily persuaded to remain, for she was
      accustomed to Margaret&rsquo;s having these attacks, and had always been kept
      out of her room the while, so she had little uneasiness to prevent her
      from being very happy, in receiving in her own simple, good-humoured way
      all the attentions that lapsed upon her in the place of her elder sisters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cocksmoor really has a church!&rdquo; was note enough of joy for her, and no
      one could look at her round face without seeing perfect happiness.
      Moreover, when after evening service, the November mist turned into
      decided rain, she was as happy as a queen in her foresight, which had
      provided what seemed an unlimited supply of cloaks and umbrellas. She
      appeared to have an original genius for making the right people give a
      lift in their carriages to the distressed; and, regarding the Abbotstoke
      britska as her own, packed in Mrs. Anderson and Fanny, in addition to all
      their own little ones, Meta thrusting Miss Bracy into the demi-corner
      destined for herself at the last minute, and, remaining with Mary, the
      only ladies obliged to walk back to Stoneborough. So delighted were they
      &ldquo;at the fun,&rdquo; that it might have been thought the most charming of
      adventures, and they laughed all the more at the lack of umbrellas. They
      went to Mrs. Elwood&rsquo;s, divested themselves of all possible finery, and
      tucked up the rest; Meta was rolled up from head to foot in a great old
      plaid shawl of Mrs. Elwood&rsquo;s, and Mary had a cloak of Richard&rsquo;s, the one
      took Norman&rsquo;s arm, the other Dr. Spencer&rsquo;s, and they trudged home through
      the darkness and the mud in the highest glee, quite sorry when the
      carriage met them half-way.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the last mirth that they enjoyed for many weeks. When they reached
      home, a sense of self-reproach for their glee thrilled over them, when
      they found a sort of hush pervading the drawing-room, and saw the faces of
      awe and consternation, worn by Blanche and George Rivers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a much worse attack than usual, and it did not go off,&rdquo; was all
      that Blanche knew, but her father had desired to be told when Dr. Spencer
      came home, and she went up with the tidings.
    </p>
    <p>
      This brought Flora down, looking dreadfully pale, and with her voice sunk
      away as it had been when she lost her child. Her husband started up,
      exclaiming at her aspect; she let him support her to the sofa, and gave
      the few particulars. Margaret had been as placid and comfortable as usual,
      till nurse came to dress her, but the first move had brought on the
      faintness and loss of breath. It did not yield to remedies, and she had
      neither looked nor spoken since, only moaned. Flora thought her father
      much alarmed; and then, after an interval, she began to entreat that they
      might stay there, sending Miss Bracy and the children to the Grange to
      make room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, Dr. Spencer had come to the sick-room, but he could only suggest
      remedies that were already in course of application to the insensible
      sufferer. Mrs. Arnott and Ethel were watching, and trying everything to
      relieve her, but with little effect, and Ethel presently stood by the fire
      with her father, as Dr. Spencer turned towards him, and he said, in a very
      low, but calm voice, &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do&mdash;I believe it is the death-stroke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not immediate,&rdquo; said Dr. Spencer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Dr. May; and he quietly spoke of what the disease had effected,
      and what yet remained for it to do, ere the silver bowl should be broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Spencer put in a word of agreement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will there be no rally?&rdquo; said Ethel, in the same tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably not,&rdquo; said Dr. May; &ldquo;the brain is generally reached at this
      stage. I have seen it coming for a long time. The thing was done seven
      years ago. There was a rally for a time when youth was strong; but
      suspense and sorrow accelerated what began from the injury to the spine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Spencer bowed his head, and looked at him anxiously, saying, &ldquo;I do not
      think there will be much acute suffering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear it may be as trying,&rdquo; said Dr. May, sighing; and then turning to
      Ethel, and throwing his arm round her, &ldquo;May God make it easy to her, and
      grant us &lsquo;patient hearts.&rsquo; We will not grudge her to all that she loves
      best, my Ethel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel clung to him, as if to derive strength from him. But the strength
      that was in them then did not come from earth. Dr. Spencer wrung his hand,
      and stepped back to the bed to try another resource. Vain again, they only
      seemed to be tormenting her, and the silent helplessness prevailed again.
      Then Dr. May went down to Flora, told her the true state of the case, and
      urged on her to give up her plan of remaining. George joined with him, and
      she yielded submissively, but would not be refused going up once again and
      kissing her sister, standing beside her gazing at her, till her father
      came softly and drew her away. &ldquo;I shall be here to-morrow,&rdquo; she said to
      Ethel, and went.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morrow, however, brought no Flora. The agitation and distress of that
      day had broken her down completely, and she was so ill as to be unable to
      move. Her aunt went at once to see her, and finding that her presence at
      the Grange relieved some of Dr. May&rsquo;s anxieties, chiefly devoted herself
      to her. Flora was grateful and gentle, but as silent and impenetrable as
      ever, while day after day she lay on her couch, uncomplaining and
      undemonstrative, visited by her father, and watched over by her aunt and
      sister-in-law, who began to know each other much better, though Flora less
      than ever, in that deep fixed grief. She only roused herself to return her
      husband&rsquo;s affection, or to listen to the daily reports of Margaret. Poor
      George, he was very forlorn, though Meta did her best to wait on him, and
      he rode over twice a day to inquire at Stoneborough.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctors were right, and the consecration morning was her last of full
      consciousness. From the hour when she had heard the sound of Alan&rsquo;s bells,
      her ears were closed to earthly sounds. There was very little power of
      intercourse with her, as she lingered on the borders of the land very far
      away, where skill and tenderness could not either reach body or spirit.
      Often the watchers could not tell whether she was conscious, or only
      incapacitated from expression, by the fearful weight on her breath, which
      caused a restlessness most piteous in the exhausted helpless frame, wasted
      till the softest touch was anguish. Now and then came precious gleams when
      a familiar voice, or some momentary alleviation would gain a smile, or
      thanks, and they thought her less restless when Richard read prayers
      beside her, but words were very rare, only now and then a name, and when
      in most distress, &ldquo;it will be soon over,&rdquo; &ldquo;it will soon be over,&rdquo; occurred
      so often, that they began to think it once her solace, and now repeated
      habitually without a meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      They could not follow her into the valley of the shadow of death, but
      could only watch the frail earthly prison-house being broken down, as if
      the doom of sin must be borne, though faith could trust that it was but
      her full share in the Cross. Calmly did those days pass. Ethel, Richard,
      and Mary divided between them the watching and the household cares, and
      their father bore up bravely in the fullness of his love and faith,
      resigning her daughter to the Hands which were bearing her whither her
      joys had long since departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hector Ernescliffe arrived when the holidays began; and his agony of
      sorrow, when she failed to recognise him, moved Dr. May to exert himself
      earnestly for his consolation; and, at the same time, Tom, in a gentle,
      almost humble manner, paid a sort of daughter-like attention to the
      smallest services for his father, as if already accepting him as his
      especial charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was midnight, on the longest night of the year; Ethel was lying on her
      bed, and had fallen into a brief slumber, when her father&rsquo;s low, clear
      voice summoned her: &ldquo;Ethel, she is going!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a change on the face, and the breath came in labouring gasps.
      Richard lifted her head, and her eyes once more opened; she smiled once
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;dear papa!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He threw himself on his knees beside her, but she looked beyond him,
      &ldquo;Mamma! Alan! oh, there they are! More! more!&rdquo; and, as though the
      unspeakable dawned on her, she gasped for utterance, then looked, with a
      consoling smile, on her father. &ldquo;Over now!&rdquo; she said&mdash;and the last
      struggle was ended. That which Richard laid down was no longer Margaret
      May.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over now! The twenty-five years&rsquo; life, the seven years&rsquo; captivity on her
      couch, the anxious headship of the motherless household, the hopeless
      betrothal, the long suspense, the efforts for resignation, the widowed
      affections, the slow decay, the tardy, painful death agony&mdash;all was
      over; nothing left, save what they had rendered the undying spirit, and
      the impress her example had left on those around her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The long continuance of the last suffering had softened the actual
      parting; and it was with thankfulness for the cessation of her pain that
      they turned away, and bade each other good-night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel would not have believed that her first wakening to the knowledge
      that Margaret was gone could have been more fraught with relief than with
      misery. And, for her father, it seemed as if it were a home-like,
      comfortable thought to him, that her mother had one of her children with
      her. He called her the first link of his Daisy Chain drawn up out of
      sight; and, during the quiet days that ensued, he seemed as it were to be
      lifted above grief, dwelling upon hope. His calmness impressed the same on
      his children, as they moved about in the solemn stillness of the house;
      and when Harry, pale, and shocked at the blow to him so sudden, came home,
      the grave silence soothed his violence of grief; and he sat beside his,
      father or Mary, speaking in undertones of what Margaret had loved to hear
      from him, of Alan Ernescliffe&rsquo;s last moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary gave way to a burst of weeping when she sought, in vain, for daisies
      in the wintry garden; but Hector Ernescliffe went down to the cloisters,
      and brought back the lingering blossoms to be placed on Margaret&rsquo;s bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dog Toby had followed him, unseen, to the cloister; and he was
      entering the garden, when he was struck by seeing the animal bounding, in
      irrepressible ecstasy, round a lad, whose tarpaulin hat, blue-bordered
      collar, and dark blue dress, showed him to be a sailor, as well as the
      broad-shouldered, grizzled, elderly man, who stood beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, sir,&rdquo; said the latter, as Hector&rsquo;s hand was on the door, &ldquo;do you
      belong to Dr. May?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hector unhesitatingly answered that he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, maybe, sir, you have heard of one Bill Jennings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hector was all in one flush, almost choking, as he told that he was Mr.
      Ernescliffe&rsquo;s brother, and gave his hand to the sailor. &ldquo;What could he do
      for him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jennings had heard from one of the crew of the Bucephalus that Mr. May had
      been met, on his return to Portsmouth, by the news of his sister&rsquo;s death.
      The Mays had helped his boy; he had been with Mr. May in the island; he
      had laid Mr. Ernescliffe in his grave; and some notion had crossed the
      sailor that he must be at Miss Margaret&rsquo;s funeral&mdash;it might be they
      would let him lend a hand&mdash;and, in this expedition, he was spending
      his time on shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      How he was welcomed need not be told, nor how the tears came forth from
      full hearts, as Dr. May granted his wish, and thanked him for doing what
      Margaret herself would indeed have chosen; and, in his blue sailor garb,
      was Jennings added to the bearers, their own men, and two Cocksmoor
      labourers, who, early on Christmas Eve, carried her to the minster. Last
      time she had been there, Alan Ernescliffe had supported her. Now, what was
      mortal of him lay beneath the palm tree, beneath the glowing summer sky,
      while the first snow-flakes hung like pearls on her pall. But as they laid
      her by her mother&rsquo;s side, who could doubt that they were together?

      CHAPTER XXVI.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     At length I got unto the gladsome hill,
             Where lay my hope;
       Where lay my heart; and, climbing still,
       When I had gained the brow and top,
     A lake of brackish waters on the ground,
             Was all I found.
                           &mdash;GEORGE HERBERT.
</pre>
    <p>
      Late in the evening of the same snowy 24th of December, a little daughter
      awoke to life at Abbotstoke Grange, and, not long after, Mrs. Arnott came
      to summon Dr May from the anxious vigil in the sitting-room. &ldquo;Come and see
      if you can do anything to soothe her,&rdquo; she said, with much alarm. &ldquo;The
      first sight of the baby has put her into such a state of agitation, that
      we do not know what to do with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was so, when he came to her bedside; that fixed stony look of despair
      was gone; the source of tears, so long dried up, had opened again; and
      there she lay, weeping quietly indeed, but profusely, and with deep
      heaving sobs. To speak, or to leave her alone, seemed equally perilous,
      but he chose the first&mdash;he kissed and blessed her, and gave her joy.
      She looked up at him as if his blessing once more brought peace, and said
      faintly, &ldquo;Now it is pardon&mdash;now I can die!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The cloud is gone! Thanks for that above all!&rdquo; said Dr. May fervently.
      &ldquo;Now, my dear, rest in thankful gladness&mdash;you are too weak to talk or
      think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am weak&mdash;I am tired of it all,&rdquo; said Flora. &ldquo;I am glad to be going
      while I am so happy&mdash;there are Margaret&mdash;my own darling&mdash;rest&mdash;peace&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not going, dearest,&rdquo; said her father; &ldquo;at least, I trust not, if
      you will not give way; here is a darling given to you, instead of the
      first, who needs you more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He would have taken the infant from the nurse and held her to her mother,
      but, recollecting how little Leonora had drawn her last breath in his
      arms, he feared the association, and signed to Mrs. Arnott to show her the
      child; but she seemed as yet only able to feel that it was not Leonora,
      and the long sealed-up grief would have its way. The tears burst out
      again. &ldquo;Tell Ethel she will be the best mother to her. Name her Margaret&mdash;make
      her a Daisy of your own&mdash;don&rsquo;t call her after me,&rdquo; she said, with
      such passionate caresses, that Mrs. Arnott was glad to take the babe away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. May&rsquo;s next expedient was to speak to her of her husband, who needed
      her more than all, and to call him in. There seemed to be something
      tranquillising in his wistful manner of repeating, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry, Flora;&rdquo; and
      she was at last reduced, by her extreme exhaustion, to stillness; but
      there were still many fears for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. May&rsquo;s prediction was accomplished&mdash;that she would suffer for
      having over-exerted herself. Her constitution had been severely tried by
      the grief and despondency that she had so long endured in silence, and the
      fresh sorrow for her favourite sister coming at such a crisis. There was a
      weariness of life, and an unwillingness to resume her ordinary routine,
      that made her almost welcome her weakness and sinking; and now that the
      black terror had cleared away from the future, she seemed to long to
      follow Margaret at once, and to yearn after her lost child; while appeals
      to the affection that surrounded her often seemed to oppress her, as if
      there were nothing but weariness and toil in store.
    </p>
    <p>
      The state of her mind made her father very anxious, though it was but too
      well accounted for. Poor Flora had voluntarily assumed the trammels that
      galled her; worldly motives had prompted her marriage, and though she
      faithfully loved her husband, he was a heavy weight on her hands, and she
      had made it more onerous by thrusting him into a position for which he was
      not calculated, and inspiring him with a self-consequence that would not
      recede from it. The shock of her child&rsquo;s death had taken away the zest and
      energy which had rejoiced in her chosen way of life, and opened her eyes
      to see what Master she had been serving; and the perception of the
      hollowness of all that had been apparently good in her, had filled her
      with remorse and despair. Her sufferings had been the more bitter because
      she had not parted with her proud reserve. She had refused council, and
      denied her confidence to those who could have guided her repentance. Her
      natural good sense, and the sound principle in which she had been brought
      up, had taught her to distrust her gloomy feelings as possibly morbid; and
      she had prayed, keeping her hold of faith in the Infinite Mercy, though
      she could not feel her own part in it; and thus that faith was beginning
      at last to clear her path.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the harder to deal with her, because her hysterical agitation was
      so easily excited, that her father hardly dared to let a word be spoken to
      her; and she was allowed to see no one else except her aunt and the dear
      old nurse, whose tears for her child Margaret had been checked by the
      urgent requirements of another of her nurslings; and whom George Rivers
      would have paid with her weight in gold, for taking care of his new
      daughter, regarding her as the only woman in the world that could be
      trusted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those were heavy days with every one, though each brought some shade of
      improvement. They were harder to bear than the peaceful days that had
      immediately followed the loss of Margaret; and Ethel was especially
      unhappy and forlorn under the new anxiety, where she could be of no
      service; and with her precious occupation gone; her father absent, instead
      of resting upon her; and her room deserted. She was grieved with herself,
      because her feelings were unable to soar at the Christmas Feast, as erst
      on St. Andrew&rsquo;s Day; and she was bewildered and distressed by the fear
      that she had then been only uplifted by vanity and elation.
    </p>
    <p>
      She told Richard so, and he said, kindly, that he thought a good deal of
      that she complained of arose from bodily weariness.
    </p>
    <p>
      This hurt her a little; but when he said, &ldquo;I think that the blessings of
      St. Andrew&rsquo;s Day helped us through what was to follow,&rdquo; she owned that it
      had indeed been so, and added, &ldquo;I am going to work again! Tell me what
      will be most useful to you at Cocksmoor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sick at heart as she was, she bravely set herself to appropriate the hours
      now left vacant; and manfully walked with Richard and Harry to church at
      Cocksmoor on St. Stephen&rsquo;s Day; but the church brought back the sense of
      contrast. Next, she insisted on fulfilling their intention of coming home
      by Abbotstoke to hear how Flora was, when the unfavourable account only
      added lead to the burden that weighed her down. Though they were sent home
      in the carriage, she was so completely spent, that the effect of returning
      home to her room, without its dear inhabitant, was quite overwhelming, and
      she sat on her bed for half an hour, struggling with repinings. She came
      downstairs without having gained the victory, and was so physically
      overcome with lassitude, that Richard insisted on her lying on the sofa,
      and leaving everything to him and Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard seemed to make her his object in life, and was an unspeakable help
      and comforter to her, not only by taking every care for her for her sake,
      but by turning to her as his own friend and confidante, the best able to
      replace what they had lost. There were many plans to be put in operation
      for Cocksmoor, on which much consultation was needed, though every word
      reminded them sadly of Margaret&rsquo;s ever ready interest in those schemes. It
      was very unlike Ethel&rsquo;s vision of the first weeks of St. Andrew&rsquo;s Church;
      but it might be safer for her than that aught should tempt her to say,
      &ldquo;See what my perseverance has wrought!&rdquo; Perhaps her Margaret had begun to
      admire her too much to be her safest confidante&mdash;at any rate, it was
      good still to sow in tears, rather than on earth to reap in confident joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norman was as brotherly and kind as possible; but it was one of the dreary
      feelings of those days, that Ethel then first became aware of the
      difference that his engagement had made, and saw that he resorted
      elsewhere for sympathy. She was not jealous, and acquiesced submissively
      and resolutely; but they had been so much to each other, that it was a
      trial, especially at such a time as this, when freshly deprived of
      Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norman&rsquo;s own prospect was not cheerful. He had received a letter from New
      Zealand, begging him to hasten his coming out, as there was educational
      work much wanting him, and, according to his original wish, he could be
      ordained there in the autumnal Ember Week.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was in much perplexity, since, according to this request, he ought to
      sail with his aunt in the last week of February, and he knew not how to
      reconcile the conflicting claims.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meta was not long in finding out the whole of his trouble, as they paced
      up and down the terrace together on a frosty afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will go!&rdquo; was her first exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ought,&rdquo; said Norman, &ldquo;I believe I ought, and if it had only been at any
      other time, it would have been easy. My aunt&rsquo;s company would have been
      such a comfort for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It cannot be helped,&rdquo; said Meta.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Considering the circumstances,&rdquo; began Norman, with lingering looks at the
      little humming-bird on his arm, &ldquo;I believe I should be justified in
      waiting till such time as you could go with me. I could see what Mr.
      Wilmot thinks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think so yourself,&rdquo; said Meta. &ldquo;Nobody else can give a
      judgment. In a thing like this, asking is, what you once called, seeking
      opinions as Balaam inquired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Turning my words against me?&rdquo; said Norman, smiling. &ldquo;Still, Meta, perhaps
      older heads would be fitter to judge what would be right for a little
      person not far off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She can be the best judge of that herself,&rdquo; said Meta. &ldquo;Norman,&rdquo; and her
      dark eyes were steadfastly fixed, &ldquo;I always resolved that, with God&rsquo;s
      help, I would not be a stumbling-block in the way of your call to your
      work. I will not. Go out now&mdash;perhaps you will be freer for it
      without me, and I suppose I have a longer apprenticeship to serve to all
      sorts of things before I come to help you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Meta, you are a rebuke to me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? when I am going to stay by my own fireside?&rdquo; said Meta, trying to
      laugh, but not very successfully. &ldquo;Seriously, I have much to do here. When
      poor Flora gets well, she must be spared all exertion for a long time to
      come; and I flatter myself that they want me at Stoneborough sometimes. If
      your father can bear to spare you, there is no doubt that you ought to
      go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father is as unselfish as you are, Meta. But I cannot speak to him
      until he is more easy about Flora. We always think the required sacrifice
      the hardest, but I must own that I could not grieve if he laid his
      commands on me to wait till the autumn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that would make it a duty and all easy,&rdquo; said Meta, smiling; &ldquo;but I
      don&rsquo;t think he will; and Aunt Flora will be only too glad to carry you out
      without encumbrance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has not Aunt Flora come to her senses about you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe she would rather I belonged to any of her nephews but you. She
      is such a dear, sincere, kind-hearted person, and we are so comfortable
      together, that it will be quite like home to come out to her! I mean
      there, to convince her that I can be of something like use.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meta talked so as to brighten and invigorate Norman when they were
      together, but they both grew low-spirited when apart. The humming-bird had
      hardly ever been so downcast as at present&mdash;that is, whenever she was
      not engaged in waiting on her brother, or in cheering up Dr. May, or in
      any of the many gentle offices that she was ever fulfilling. She was
      greatly disappointed, and full of fears for Norman, and dread of the
      separation, but she would not give way; and only now and then, when off
      her guard, would the sadness reign on her face without an effort. Alone,
      she fought and prayed for resignation for herself, and protection and
      strength for him, and chid herself for the foolish feeling that he would
      be safer with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She told Aunt Flora how it was one evening, as they sat over the fire
      together, speaking with a would-be tone of congratulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Arnott. &ldquo;But that is a great pity!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meta looked quite brightened by her saying so. &ldquo;I thought you would be
      glad,&rdquo; she rejoined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you think me so hard-hearted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you believed he would be better without me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, we have not kept house and nursed together for a month for
      nothing,&rdquo; said Mrs. Arnott, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Meta, trying to answer the smile. &ldquo;You have taken a load
      off me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it at all,&rdquo; said Mrs. Arnott. &ldquo;It is a very uncomfortable
      plan for every one. And yet when I know how great is the want of him out
      there, I can say nothing against it without high treason. Well, my dear,
      I&rsquo;ll take all the care I can of Norman, and when you come, I shall be
      almost as glad as if we were coming home for good. Poor Flora! she is one
      person who will not regret the arrangement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Flora!&mdash;you think her really better this evening?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much better, indeed; if we could only raise her spirits, I think she
      would recover very well; but she is so sadly depressed. I must try to talk
      to Ethel&mdash;she may better understand her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never understood Flora,&rdquo; said Meta. &ldquo;She has been as kind to me as
      possible, and I very soon came to a certain point with her, but I never
      have known her thoroughly. I doubt whether any one did but dear Margaret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flora was, however, much softened and less reserved than she had been. She
      found great repose in her aunt&rsquo;s attendance, retracing, as it did, her
      mother&rsquo;s presence, and she responded to her tenderness with increasing
      reliance and comfort; while as her strength began to revive, and there was
      more disposition to talk, she became gradually drawn into greater
      confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The seeing of Ethel was one of the difficult questions. Flora had begun to
      wish it very much, and yet the bare idea threw her into a nervous tremor,
      that caused it to be put off again and again. Her aunt found her one day
      almost faint with agitation&mdash;she had heard Ethel&rsquo;s voice in the next
      room, and had been winding up her expectations, and now was as much
      grieved as relieved, to find that she had been there seeing the baby, but
      was now gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How does the dear Ethel look?&rdquo; asked Flora presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is looking better to-day; she has looked very worn and harassed, but
      I thought her brighter to-day. She walked over by Aubrey on his pony, and
      I think it did her good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear old Ethel! Aunt, it is a thing that no one has told me yet. Can you
      tell me how she bore the news of Norman Ogilvie&rsquo;s engagement?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean&mdash;&rdquo; and Mrs. Arnott stopped short in her interrogation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Flora, answering the pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I thought young Ogilvie a most unexceptionable person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he is,&rdquo; said Flora. &ldquo;I was much annoyed at the time, but she was
      resolute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In rejecting him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In running away as soon as she found what was likely to happen;&rdquo; and
      Flora, in a few words, told what had passed at Oxford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it was entirely out of devotion to your father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Entirely,&rdquo; said Flora. &ldquo;No one could look at her without seeing that she
      liked him. I had left her to be the only effective one at home, and she
      sacrificed herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad that I have seen her,&rdquo; said Mrs. Arnott. &ldquo;I should never have
      understood her by description. I always said that I must come home to set
      my correspondence going rightly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Flora,&rdquo; said her niece, &ldquo;do you remember my dear mother&rsquo;s unfinished
      letter to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure I do, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing ever was more true,&rdquo; said Flora. &ldquo;I read it over some little time
      ago, when I set my papers in order, and understood it then. I never did
      before. I used to think it very good for the others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is what one generally does with good advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you recollect the comparison between Norman, Ethel, and me? It is so
      curious. Norman, who was ambitious and loved praise, but now dreads
      nothing so much; Ethel, who never cared for anything of the kind, but went
      straight on her own brave way; and oh! Aunt Flora&mdash;me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, my dear, I should have thought you had her most full
      approbation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! don&rsquo;t you see the tone, as if she were not fully satisfied, as if she
      only could not see surface faults in me,&rdquo; said Flora; &ldquo;and how she said
      she dreaded my love of praise, and of being liked. I wonder how it would
      have been if she had lived. I have looked back so often in the past year,
      and I think the hollowness began from that time. It might have been there
      before, but I am not so sure. You see, at that dreadful time, after the
      accident, I was the eldest who was able to be efficient, and much more
      useful than poor Ethel. I think the credit I gained made me think myself
      perfection, and I never did anything afterwards but seek my own honour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Arnott began better to understand Flora&rsquo;s continued depression, but
      she thought her self-reproach exaggerated, and said something at once
      soothing and calculated to encourage her to undraw the curtain of reserve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not know,&rdquo; continued Flora, &ldquo;how greedy I was of credit and
      affection. It made me jealous of Ethel herself, as long as we were in the
      same sphere; and when I felt that she was more to papa than I could be, I
      looked beyond home for praise. I don&rsquo;t think the things I did were bad in
      themselves&mdash;brought up as I have been, they could hardly be so. I
      knew what merits praise and blame too well for that&mdash;but oh! the
      motive. I do believe I cared very much for Cocksmoor. I thought it would
      be a grand thing to bring about; but, you see, as it has turned out, all I
      thought I had done for it was in vain; and Ethel has been the real person
      and does not know it. I used to think Ethel so inferior to me. I left her
      all my work at home. If it had not been for that, she might have been
      happy with Norman Ogilvie&mdash;for never were two people better matched,
      and now she has done what I never thought to have left to another&mdash;watched
      over our own Margaret. Oh! how shall I ever bear to see her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, I am sure nothing can be more affectionate than Ethel. She does
      not think these things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She does,&rdquo; said Flora. &ldquo;She always knew me better than I did myself. Her
      straightforward words should often have been rebukes to me. I shall see in
      every look and tone the opinion I have deserved. I have shrunk from her
      steadfast looks ever since I myself learned what I was. I could not bear
      them now&mdash;and yet&mdash;oh, aunt, you must bring her! Ethel! my dear,
      dear old King&mdash;my darling&rsquo;s godmother&mdash;the last who was with
      Margaret!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had fallen into one of those fits of weeping when it was impossible to
      attempt anything but soothing her; but, though she was so much exhausted
      that Mrs. Arnott expected to be in great disgrace with Dr. May for having
      let her talk herself into this condition, she found that he was satisfied
      to find that she had so far relieved her mind, and declared that she would
      be better now.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect of the conversation was, that the next day, the last of the
      twelve Christmas days, when Ethel, whose yearning after her sister was
      almost equally divided between dread and eagerness&mdash;eagerness for her
      embrace, and dread of the chill of her reserve, came once again in hopes
      of an interview. Dr. May called her at once. &ldquo;I shall take you in without
      any preparation,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that she may not have time to be flurried.
      Only, be quiet and natural.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Did he know what a mountain there was in her throat when he seemed to
      think it so easy to be natural?
    </p>
    <p>
      She found him leading her into a darkened room, and heard his cheerful
      tones saying, &ldquo;I have brought Ethel to you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ethel! oh!&rdquo; said a low, weak voice, with a sound as of expecting a treat,
      and Ethel was within a curtain, where she began, in the dimness, to see
      something white moving, and her hands were clasped by two long thin ones.
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; said Dr. May, &ldquo;now, if you will be good, I will leave you alone.
      Nurse is by to look after you, and you know she always separates naughty
      children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Either the recurrence to nursery language, or the mere sisterly touch
      after long separation, seemed to annihilate all the imaginary mutual
      dread, and, as Ethel bent lower and lower, and Flora&rsquo;s arms were round
      her, the only feeling was of being together again, and both at once made
      the childish gesture of affection, and murmured the old pet names of
      &ldquo;Flossy,&rdquo; and &ldquo;King,&rdquo; that belonged to almost forgotten days, when they
      were baby sisters, then kissed each other again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see you,&rdquo; said Ethel, drawing herself up a little. &ldquo;Why, Flora,
      you look like a little white shadow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have had such weak eyes,&rdquo; said Flora, &ldquo;and this dim light is
      comfortable. I see your old sharp face quite plain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what can you do here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do? Oh, dear Ethel, I have not had much of doing. Papa says I have three
      years&rsquo; rest to make up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Flora!&rdquo; said Ethel; &ldquo;but I should have thought it tiresome,
      especially for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have only now been able to think again,&rdquo; said Flora; &ldquo;and you will say
      I am taking to quoting poetry. Do you remember some lines in that drama
      that Norman admired so much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Philip von Artevelde?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I can&rsquo;t recollect them now, though they used to be always running in
      my head&mdash;something about time to mend and time to mourn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These?&rdquo; said Ethel&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
              &ldquo;He that lacks time to mourn, lacks time to mend.
               Eternity mourns that.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never had time before for either,&rdquo; said Flora. &ldquo;You cannot think how I
      used to be haunted by those, when I was chased from one thing to another,
      all these long, long eighteen months. I am in no haste to take up work
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mending as well as mourning,&rdquo; said Ethel thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now you have that dear little Christmas gift to&mdash;&rdquo; Ethel paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is not nearly so fine and healthy as her sister was,&rdquo; said Flora,
      &ldquo;poor little dear. You know, Ethel, even now, I shall have very little
      time with her in that London life. Her papa wants me so much, and I must
      leave her to&mdash;to the nurses.&rdquo; Flora&rsquo;s voice trembled again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our own dear old nurse,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I wanted to thank you all for sparing her to us,&rdquo; said Flora. &ldquo;George
      wished it so much. But how does poor little Daisy bear it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very magnanimously,&rdquo; said Ethel, smiling. &ldquo;In fact, nurse has had but
      little to do with Daisy of late, and would have been very forlorn at home.
      It is better for Aubrey and for her, not to return to be babies to comfort
      poor nurse. I have been breaking up the nursery, and taking Gertrude to
      live with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you gone back there again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would not have been better for waiting,&rdquo; said Ethel; &ldquo;and Gertrude was
      so proud to come to me. I could not have done it without her, but papa
      must not have vacancy next to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has been hard on you for me to engross him,&rdquo; said Flora; &ldquo;but oh,
      Ethel, I could not spare him. I don&rsquo;t think even you can tell what papa
      is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have found it out,&rdquo; said Ethel, in an odd, dry manner; which in
      sound, though not in feeling, was a contrast to the soft, whispering,
      tearful murmurs of her sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And my aunt!&rdquo; continued Flora&mdash;&ldquo;that I should have taken up such a
      great piece of her short visit!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! it is coming to an end very fast,&rdquo; said Ethel, sighing; &ldquo;but you had
      the best right to her, and she and Meta have seen so much of each other.
      She tells me she is quite satisfied about Meta now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry to see Meta looking out of spirits,&rdquo; said Flora. &ldquo;I almost
      made her cry by saying something about Norman. Is there anything going
      wrong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel, as usual, blundered into the subject. &ldquo;Only about Norman&rsquo;s going
      out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flora asked further questions, and she was obliged to explain. It roused
      Flora&rsquo;s energies at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This will never do!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They must marry, and go with my aunt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel was aghast. &ldquo;They would not hear of it now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They must. It is the only reasonable thing. Why, Norman would be
      miserable, and as to Meta&mdash;Imagine his going out and returning&mdash;a
      year&rsquo;s work, such an expense and loss of time, besides the missing Aunt
      Flora.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it were not wrong&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The waste would be the wrong thing. Besides&mdash;&rdquo; and she told of
      Margaret&rsquo;s wishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Flora, think&mdash;the last week in February&mdash;and you so ill!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not to marry them,&rdquo; said Flora, smiling. &ldquo;If it could be in a
      fortnight, they could go and get their outfit afterwards, and come back to
      us when I am stronger. Let me see&mdash;there need be no fuss about
      settlements&mdash;Mr. Rivers&rsquo;s will arranges everything for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be a good thing to get rid of a fine wedding,&rdquo; said Ethel; &ldquo;but
      they will never consent!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, they will, and be grateful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa would be happier about Norman,&rdquo; said Ethel; &ldquo;but I cannot fancy his
      liking it. And you&mdash;you can&rsquo;t spare Meta, for Aunt Flora must go to
      the Arnotts&rsquo; in a week or two more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose papa was to let me have you,&rdquo; said Flora. &ldquo;If he wants you, he
      must come after you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel gasped at the thought that her occupation at home was gone, but she
      said, &ldquo;If I am not too awkward for you, dear Flora. You will miss Meta
      terribly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t keep the humming-bird caged, with her heart far away,&rdquo; said
      Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. May came in to break up the conversation, and Ethel quickly guessed
      from his manner that Norman had been talking to him. Flora told him that
      she had been agreeing with Ethel that Meta had much better not miss this
      opportunity. He was far less startled than Ethel had expected; indeed, the
      proposal was rather a relief to his mind, and his chief objection was the
      fear that Flora would be fatigued by the extra bustle; but she promised
      not to trouble herself about it, otherwise than that if Norman could not
      persuade Meta, she would. The sisters parted, much more comfortable than
      before. Ethel felt as if she had found something like a dim reflection of
      Margaret, and Flora&rsquo;s fear of Ethel had fled away from the mere force of
      sisterhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to Norman, he declared that he had not the audacity to make the
      proposal to Meta, though he was only too grateful; so his father carried
      it to the humming-bird; and, as soon as she found that it was not
      improper, nor would hurt any one&rsquo;s feelings, she gave ready consent&mdash;only
      begging that it might be as best suited every one, especially Flora; and
      ending by a whisper to her dear fatherly friend, owning that she was &ldquo;very
      glad&mdash;she meant she was very glad there would be nobody there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Norman and Meta settled their plans as they walked home together from
      evening service, after listening to the prophecies of the blessings to be
      spread into the waste and desolate places, which should yet become the
      heritage of the Chosen, and with the evening star shining on them, like a
      faint reflex of the Star of the East, Who came to be a Light to lighten
      the Gentiles.

      CHAPTER XXVII.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Euna delle facolta singolari ed incommunicabili della religione
  Cristiana questa, di poter dare indirizzo e quiete a chiunoque, in
  qualsivoglia congiuntura, a qualsivoglia termine, ricorra ad essa.

  gioje della vocazione.&mdash;MANZONI.
</pre>
    <p>
      The wedding-day was fixed for the 20th of January, since it was less risk
      to Flora as an absolute invalid, than as convalescent enough to take any
      share in the doings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meta managed her correspondence with her own relatives, and obtained her
      uncle&rsquo;s kind approval, since he saw there could be nothing else; while her
      aunt treated her as an infatuated victim, but wished, for her mother&rsquo;s
      sake, to meet her in London before she sailed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The worst stroke of all was to Bellairs, who had never chosen to believe
      that her mistress could move without her, and though mortally afraid in
      crossing to the Isle of Wight, and utterly abhorring all &ldquo;natives,&rdquo; went
      into hysterics on finding that her young lady would take out no maid but a
      little hard-working village girl; and though transferred in the most
      flattering manner to Mrs. Rivers&rsquo;s service, shed a tear for every stitch
      she set in the trousseau, and assured her betrothed butler that, if Miss
      Rivers would only have heard reason, she would have followed her to the
      world&rsquo;s end, rather than that her beautiful hair should never look like
      anything again.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the wedding-day came, and grass and trees wore a fitting suit of crisp
      hoariness. Nothing could be quieter. Meta was arrayed by the sobbing
      Bellairs in her simple bridal white, wrapped herself in a large shawl,
      took her brother&rsquo;s arm, and walked down the frosty path with him and Mrs.
      Arnott, as if going merely to the daily service.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time had not been made known, and there was hardly an addition to the
      ordinary congregation, except the May family and Dr. Spencer; but the
      Christmas evergreens still adorned aisle and chancel, and over the altar
      stood the motto that Meta herself had woven of holly, on that Christmas
      Eve of grief and anxiety, without knowing how it would speak to her.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Fear not, for behold I bring unto you glad tidings of great joy,
  that shall be unto you and to all people.
</pre>
    <p>
      Fear not, for length of voyage, for distance from kindred, for hardship,
      privation, misunderstanding, disappointment. The glad tidings are to all
      people, even to the utmost parts of the earth. Ye have your portion in the
      great joy&mdash;ye have freely cast in your lot with those, whose feet are
      beautiful on the mountains, who bear the good tidings. Fear not, for He is
      with you, who will never forsake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus Dr. May read the words with swelling heart, as he looked at his son&rsquo;s
      clear, grave, manful look, even as it had been when he made his
      Confirmation vow&mdash;his natural nervous excitability quelled by a
      spirit not his own, and chastened into strong purpose; and the bride, her
      young face the more lovely for the depth of enthusiasm restrained by awe
      and humility, as she stood without trembling or faltering, the strength of
      innocence expressed in the whole bearing of her slight figure in her white
      drapery. Around were the four sisterly bride&rsquo;s-maids, their black dresses
      showing that these were still the twilight days of mourning, and that none
      would forget her, whose prayers might still bless their labour of love.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Margaret Agatha May, on her husband&rsquo;s arm, turned for a last look at
      the altar of her own church, &ldquo;Fear not,&rdquo; in evergreen letters, was the
      greeting she bore away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel was left at the Grange for the ensuing fortnight&mdash;a time of
      unusual leisure both to her and to Flora, which they both prized highly,
      for it taught them to know each other as they had never done before.
      Flora&rsquo;s confidence to her aunt had been a good thing for her, though so
      partial; it opened the way for further unreserve to one who knew the
      circumstances better, and, as to dread of Ethel, that could seldom prevail
      in her presence, partly from long habit, partly from her deficiency of
      manner, and still more from her true humility and affection. Gradually she
      arrived at the perception of the history of her sister&rsquo;s mind; understood
      what gloom had once overshadowed it; and how, since light had once shone
      upon her, she shrank not merely from the tasks that had become wearisome
      to her, but from the dread of losing among them her present peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are your duty,&rdquo; argued Ethel. &ldquo;Duty brings peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were not,&rdquo; said Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are now,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dinners and parties, empty talk and vain show,&rdquo; said Flora languidly.
      &ldquo;Are you come to their defence, Ethel? If you could guess how sick one
      gets of them, and how much worse it is for them not to be hateful! And to
      think of bringing my poor little girl up to the like, if she is spared!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they are not duties, I would not do them,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ethel,&rdquo; cried her sister, raising herself from her couch eagerly, &ldquo;I will
      say it to you! What should you think of George resigning his seat, and
      living in peace here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would he?&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I wished it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what would he do with himself?&rdquo; said Ethel, not in too complimentary
      a strain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yachting, farming, Cochin-Chinese&mdash;or something,&rdquo; said Flora.
      &ldquo;Anything not so wearing as this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That abominable candidate of Tomkins&rsquo;s would come in!&rdquo; exclaimed Ethel.
      &ldquo;Oh, Flora, that would be horrid!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That might be guarded against,&rdquo; said Flora. &ldquo;Perhaps Sir Henry&mdash;But
      oh! let us leave politics in peace while we can. I thought we should do
      some great good, but it is all a maze of confusion. It is so hard to know
      principles from parties, and everything goes wrong! It is of no use to
      contend with it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is never vain to contend with evil,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are not generalising,&rdquo; said Flora. &ldquo;There is evil nearer home than the
      state of parties, and I can&rsquo;t see that George&rsquo;s being in Parliament&mdash;being
      what he is&mdash;is anything like the benefit to things in general&mdash;that
      it is temptation and plague to me, besides the risk of London life for the
      baby, now and hereafter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say that I think it is,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;How nice it would be to
      have you here! I am so glad you are willing to give it up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would have been better to have given it up untasted&mdash;like
      Norman,&rdquo; sighed Flora. &ldquo;I will talk to George.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Flora,&rdquo; said Ethel, a little startled, &ldquo;you ought not to do such a
      thing without advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There will be worry enough before it is done!&rdquo; sighed Flora. &ldquo;No fear of
      that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop a minute,&rdquo; said Ethel, as if poor Flora could have done anything but
      lie still on her sofa. &ldquo;I think you ought to consider well before you set
      it going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have not I longed for it day and night? It is an escape from peril for
      ourselves and our child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t be sure!&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;It may be more wrong to make George desert
      the post which&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which I thrust him into,&rdquo; said Flora. &ldquo;My father told me as much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not mean you to say that! But it is a puzzle. It seems as if it
      were right to give up such things; yet, when I recollect the difficulty of
      carrying an election right at Stoneborough, I think papa would be very
      sorry. I don&rsquo;t think his interest would bring in any sound man but his
      son-in-law; and George himself seems to like his parliamentary life better
      than anything else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Flora hesitatingly; for she knew it was true&mdash;he liked to
      think himself important, and it gave him something to think of, and
      regular occupation&mdash;not too active or onerous; but she could not tell
      Ethel what she herself felt; that all she could do for him could not
      prevent him from being held cheap by the men among whom she had placed
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Ethel, as she heard her affirmative, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it is for
      his dignity, for you to put him into Parliament to please you and then
      take him out to please you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take care of his dignity,&rdquo; said Flora shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you would do it well&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sick of doing things well!&rdquo; said poor Flora. &ldquo;You little know how I
      dread reading up all I must read presently! I shall lose all I have
      scarcely gained. I cannot find peace any way, but by throwing down the
      load I gave my peace for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whether this is truth or fancy,&rdquo; said Ethel thoughtfully. &ldquo;If you would
      ask some one competent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know there are some things one cannot ask?&rdquo; said Flora. &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t know why I spoke to you! Ah! come in! Why, George, that is a finer
      egg than ever,&rdquo; as he entered with a Shanghai egg in each hand, for her to
      mark with the date when it had been laid. Poultry was a new hobby, and
      Ethel had been hearing, in her tete-a-tete dinners with George, a great
      deal about the perfections of the hideous monsters that had obtained
      fabulous prices. They had been the best resource for conversation; but she
      watched, with something between vexation and softness, how Flora roused
      herself to give her full attention and interest to his prosing about his
      pets, really pleased as it seemed; and, at last, encouraging him actually
      to fetch his favourite cock to show her; when she went through the points
      of perfection of the ungainly mass of feathers, and did not at all allow
      Ethel to laugh at the unearthly sounds of disapproval which handling
      elicited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this is our senator!&rdquo; thought Ethel. &ldquo;I wonder whether Honorius&rsquo;s hen
      was a Shanghai! Poor Flora is right&mdash;it is poor work to make a silk
      purse out of a sow&rsquo;s ear! but, putting him into the place is one thing,
      taking him out another. I wish she would take advice; but I never knew her
      do that, except as a civil way of communicating her intentions. However,
      she is not quite what she was! Poor dear! Aunt Flora will never believe
      what a beautiful creature she used to be! It seems wrong to think of her
      going back to that horrid London; but I can&rsquo;t judge. For my part, I&rsquo;d
      rather do work, than no work for George, and he is a good, kind-hearted
      fellow after all! I won&rsquo;t be a crab!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Ethel did her best, and said the cock had a bright eye&mdash;all she
      could say for him&mdash;and George instructed her to admire the awkward
      legs, and invited her to a poultry show, at Whitford, in two days&rsquo; time&mdash;and
      they sent him away to continue his consultations with the poultry woman,
      which pullets should be preferred as candidates for a prize.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meta set him upon this,&rdquo; said Flora. &ldquo;I hope you will go, Ethel. You see
      he can be very happy here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;the more I think, the more sure I am that you ought
      to ask advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have asked yours,&rdquo; said Flora, as if it were a great effort. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
      know what to say&mdash;I shall do what I see to be the only way to rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do know what to say,&rdquo; said Ethel; &ldquo;and that is, do as the Prayer-book
      tells you, in any perplexity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not perplexed,&rdquo; said Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say so. This is either the station to which God has called you, or
      it is not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He never called me to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t know whether you ought to leave it. If you ought not, you
      would be ten times more miserable. Go to Richard, Flora&mdash;he belongs
      to you as much as I&mdash;he has authority besides.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is the clearest of us all in practical matters,&rdquo; said Ethel,
      preventing what she feared would be disparaging. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean only that
      you should ask him about this Parliament matter alone; but I am sure you
      would be happier and more settled if you talked things over with him
      before&mdash;before you go to church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what you propose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said Ethel, growing bolder. &ldquo;You have been going all this time by
      feeling. You have never cleared up, and got to the bottom of, your
      troubles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not talk to any one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to any one but a clergyman. Now, to enter on such a thing is most
      averse to your nature; and I do believe that, for that very reason, it
      would be what would do you most good. You say you have recovered sense of&mdash;Oh,
      Flora! I can&rsquo;t talk of what you have gone through; but if you have only a
      vague feeling that seems as if lying still would be the only way to keep
      it, I don&rsquo;t think it can be altogether sound, or the &lsquo;quiet conscience&rsquo;
      that is meant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Ethel! Ethel! I have never told you what I have undergone, since I
      knew my former quietness of conscience was but sleep! I have gone on in
      agony, with the sense of hypocrisy and despair, because I was afraid, for
      George&rsquo;s sake, to do otherwise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel felt herself utterly powerless to advise; and, after a kind sound of
      sympathy, sat shocked, pondering on what none could answer; whether this
      were, indeed, what poor Flora imagined, or whether it had been a
      holding-fast to the thread through the darkness. The proud reserve was the
      true evil, and Ethel prayed and trusted it might give way.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went very amiably to Whitford with George, and gained great credit
      with him, for admiring the prettiest speckled Hamburgh present; indeed,
      George was becoming very fond of &ldquo;poor Ethel,&rdquo; as he still called her, and
      sometimes predicted that she would turn out a fine figure of a woman after
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel heard, on her return, that Richard had been there; and three days
      after, when Flora was making arrangements for going to church, a moment of
      confidence came over her, and she said, &ldquo;I did it, Ethel! I have spoken to
      Richard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so glad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were right. He is as clear as he is kind,&rdquo; said Flora; &ldquo;he showed me
      that, for George&rsquo;s sake, I must bear with my present life, and do the best
      I can with it, unless some leading comes for an escape; and that the
      glare, and weariness, and being spoken well of, must be taken as
      punishment for having sought after these things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was afraid he would say so,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;But you will find happiness
      again, Flora dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scarcely&mdash;before I come to Margaret and to my child,&rdquo; sighed Flora.
      &ldquo;I suppose it was Mercy that would not let me follow when I wished it. I
      must work till the time of rest comes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your own little Margaret will cheer you!&rdquo; said Ethel, more hopefully,
      as she saw Flora bend over her baby with a face that might one day be
      bright.
    </p>
    <p>
      She trusted that patient continuance in well-doing would one day win peace
      and joy, even in the dreary world that poor Flora had chosen.
    </p>
    <p>
      For her own part, Ethel found Flora&rsquo;s practical good sense and sympathy
      very useful, in her present need of the counsel she had always had from
      Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      The visit to Flora lasted a fortnight, and Ethel was much benefited by the
      leisure for reading and the repose after the long nursing; though, before
      the end, her refreshed energies began to pine for Daisy and her hymns, for
      Aubrey and his Virgil, for Cherry and her scholars, and, above all, for
      her father; for, come as often as he would, it was not papa at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, Mary was at a loss for Ethel every hour; Richard was
      putting off his affairs till Ethel should come home; Miss Bracy and
      Blanche longed for her to relieve the schoolroom from the children; Aubrey
      could not perform a lesson in comfort with any one else&mdash;never ended
      a sum without groaning for Ethel, and sometimes rode to Abbotstoke for the
      mere purpose of appealing to her; in short, no one could get on without
      her, and the doctor least of all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Spencer, and Mr. Wilmot, and all his sons and daughters, had done
      their best for him; but, in spite of his satisfaction at seeing the two
      sisters so happy together, he could not help missing Ethel every minute,
      as the very light of his home; and when, at last, Flora brought her back,
      she was received with uproarious joy by Aubrey and Daisy, while the rest
      of the household felt a revival and refreshment of spirits&mdash;the first
      drawing aside of the cloud that had hung over the winter. The pearl of
      their home might be missed every hour, but they could thankfully rest in
      the trust that she was a jewel stored up in safety and peace, to shine as
      a star for evermore.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few weeks more, and there were other partings, sad indeed, yet cheery.
      Dr. May told Mrs. Arnott that, though he grieved that so much of sorrow
      had come to dim her visit, he could not but own that it was the very time
      when her coming could be most comforting; and this, as she truly said, was
      satisfaction enough for her, besides that she could not rejoice enough
      that her arrival had been in time to see their dear Margaret. She should
      carry away most precious recollections; and she further told Dr. Spencer
      that she was far more comfortable about her brother-in-law, than if she
      had only known him in his youthful character, which had seemed so little
      calculated to bear sorrow or care. She looked at him now only to wonder
      at, and reverence the change that had been gradually wrought by the
      affections placed above.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norman and his wife went with her&mdash;the one grave but hopeful, the
      other trying to wile away the pain of parting, by her tearful mirth&mdash;making
      all sorts of odd promises and touching requests, between jest and earnest,
      and clinging to the last to her dear father-in-law, as if the separation
      from him were the hardest of all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, humming-birds must be let fly!&rdquo; said he at last. &ldquo;Ah! ha! Meta, are
      they of no use?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay till you hear!&rdquo; said Meta archly&mdash;then turning back once more.
      &ldquo;Oh! how I have thanked you, Ethel, for those first hints you gave me how
      to make my life real. If I had only sat still and wished, instead of
      trying what could be done as I was, how unhappy I should have been!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, take your sprite away, Norman, if you don&rsquo;t want me to keep her for
      good! God bless you, my dear children! Good-bye! Who knows but when Doctor
      Tom sets up in my place, Ethel and I may come out and pay you a visit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It had all been over for some weeks, and the home-party had settled down
      again into what was likely to be their usual course, excepting in the
      holidays, to which the doctor looked forward with redoubled interest, as
      Tom was fast becoming a very agreeable and sensible companion; for his
      moodiness had been charmed away by Meta, and principle was teaching him
      true command of temper. He seemed to take his father as a special charge,
      bequeathed to him by Norman, and had already acquired that value and
      importance at home which comes of the laying aside of all self-importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a clear evening in March, full of promise of spring, and Ethel was
      standing in the church porch at Cocksmoor, after making some visits in the
      parish, waiting for Richard, while the bell was ringing for the Wednesday
      evening service, and the pearly tints of a cloudless sunset were fading
      into the western sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel began to wonder where Norman might be looking at the sun dipping
      into the western sea, and thence arose before her the visions of her
      girlhood, when she had first dreamt of a church on Cocksmoor, and of
      Richard ministering before a willing congregation. So strange did the
      accomplishment seem, that she even touched the stone to assure herself of
      the reality; and therewith came intense thanksgiving that the work had
      been taken out of her hands, to be the more fully blessed and accomplished&mdash;that
      is, as far as the building went; as to the people, there was far more
      labour in store, and the same Hand must be looked to for the increase.
    </p>
    <p>
      For herself, Ethel looked back and looked on. Norman Ogilvie&rsquo;s marriage
      seemed to her to have fixed her lot in life, and what was that lot? Home
      and Cocksmoor had been her choice, and they were before her. Home! but her
      eyes had been opened to see that earthly homes may not endure, nor fill
      the heart. Her dear father might, indeed, claim her full-hearted devotion,
      but, to him, she was only one of many. Norman was no longer solely hers;
      and she had begun to understand that the unmarried woman must not seek
      undivided return of affection, and must not set her love, with exclusive
      eagerness, on aught below, but must be ready to cease in turn to be first
      with any. Ethel was truly a mother to the younger ones; but she faced the
      probability that they would find others to whom she would have the second
      place. To love each heartily, to do her utmost for each in turn, and to be
      grateful for their fondness, was her call; but never to count on their
      affection as her sole right and inalienable possession. She felt that this
      was the probable course, and that she might look to becoming comparatively
      solitary in the course of years&mdash;then tried to realise what her
      lonely life might be, but broke off smiling at herself, &ldquo;What is that to
      me? What will it be when it is over? My course and aim are straight on,
      and He will direct my paths. I don&rsquo;t know that I shall be alone, and I
      shall have the memory&mdash;the communion with them, if not their
      presence. Some one there must be to be loved and helped, and the poor for
      certain. Only I must have my treasure above, and when I think what is
      there, and of&mdash;Oh! that bliss of being perfectly able to praise&mdash;with
      no bad old self to mar the full joy of giving thanks, and blessing, and
      honour, and power! Need I dread a few short years?&mdash;and they have not
      begun yet&mdash;perhaps they won&rsquo;t&mdash;Oh! here is actually papa coming
      home this way! how delightful! Papa, are you coming to church here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, Ethel. That weathercock of Spencer&rsquo;s is a magnet, I believe! It draws
      me from all parts of the country to hear Richard in St. Andrew&rsquo;s Church.&rdquo;
     </p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
